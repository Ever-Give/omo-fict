As Florence Galworth walked across the fields to Strechley Manor to attend Mrs. Millicent Blakley&#039;s &#039;at home&#039; morning, she wondered what was planned for this morning. Millicent Blakley was renowned locally for being slight unconventional, such as having &#039;at homes&#039; in the morning as well as the afternoon, but Florence considered that overall she was lucky to such an entertaining family as neighbors. Mrs. Blakley&#039;s two daughters, both comely blondes, were a renowned attraction for aspiring bachelors in the county, and Florence, who was slim and dark, and also a number of years older than the two sisters, was content to offer a more seriously minded…</p>
