        <p class="card-text">When Katie awoke some time later, finding that she smelling strongly of dried pee, she remembered that she had to get the mink panties cleaned. She picked up the phone and rang the express collect delivery service, finding that an item could be cleaned and returned within an hour. Retrieving the panties from the radiator, she found that though they were dry they had a strong pungent odor, so to avoid embarrassment she added some strong perfume. Then sealing them in a bag, it would not completely mask the sexy smell but it might stop the cleaners from thinking too much.
The courier called later for the dirty panties, promising to return them in an hour and a half, leaving Katie time to shower, wash her hair…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Mia Stevens got out of her white Kia Reo, the only car she could afford when her college costs were considered, and knew that she was more than a little nervous. It was late evening on a cool September night; the sun&#039;s final blood red rays were streaming through the leaves of a nearby tree. She pulled her blue jean jacket closer around her body to fend off the wind and started up the sidewalk towards the pale green house. At the age of nineteen, Mia was a beautiful girl. She had very long, curly black hair that was pulled back into a ponytail. Her curves were perfect and well defined and her face held the very essence of beauty. She was wearing a white sweater and light, faded blue jeans, just as she had been…</p>

They knew that neither of them would be able to drive, so Jane and Lori had left their car at Jane&#039;s cousin&#039;s house where they were staying. They had been drinking for about 4 hours– and just recently had a couple of pitchers of beer. They knew that the last bus ran at 2:15am and they would have to make it or have no way home, as a person could never get a taxi at that time of night. The guys were also taking the bus, but in the opposite direction, and said that their last bus would run 1:55am. It was getting close to that…</p>

Her position was created to allow the permanent and full–time toll takers some vacation time in the summer. She was to come in on Monday, Wednesday and Friday from 10:00 AM till 3:00 PM. Her pay was quite handsome compared to the other summertime jobs she had during her college years. 
She only had to be in the booth for four hours and she had an hour for lunch. She was provided with a uniform, which consisted of: a smoky gray cotton twill blouse and A–line skirt of gabardine which had…</p>

Two glasses, and she still wanted more, but Mom interrupted her. &quot;Ashley, we&#039;re ready, say goodbye to your sister, and let&#039;s get this thing started.&quot; It was the day all recent high school graduates waited for with anticipation: the 1st day of college. The two of them had already packed up the car, cleaned out her room (that her younger sister Katie was inheriting) and was ready to go.

I was standing, as I had given my seat to an older woman a few stops ago. The man next to me got off at the next stop, exiting through the door in the middle of the bus, and the crowd of people shifted a little toward the back. I wasn&#039;t paying much attention because I was trying to pass the time by looking at the streets of the city as we drove by. I would always do this, because everyone was walking around in the center of town, including a lot of beautiful women, and it made the trip a little easier.

It was late October, and that morning had been pleasantly chilly on the walk from her apartment to the station and then to her office at the end of the line. The overcast sky and the ever so slight nip in the breeze had gotten her thinking; maybe this was one of her special days. When lunchtime had finally rolled around, she&#039;d known for sure.

        <p class="card-text">Sighting? Well no, but sort of a story. Back in the late fifties and early sixties I was an enlisted member of the United States Air Force. In 1962 I was in a position as a peon who manned the coffee bar at my squadron operations facility. In this role I was privy to many pilots&#039; conversations.
There was one conversation that was particularly interesting, as you will see. My squadron was one of fighter interceptor aircraft in the New York/Washington D. C. air defense sectors. These fighter interceptors were two–seater, two engine aircraft capable of mach one speeds with a cruising range of 1500 miles. However, for the purposes of this story they normally cruised at less than mach one for less than 1500 miles.…</p>

        <p class="card-text">In the last episode of Nancy&#039;s experiences we saw her in a very embarrassing situation on a city bus where her bladder released accidentally flooding her clothes. She was experiencing a public wetting humiliation to the nth degree only to awaken to a wet bed. Nancy&#039;s wetting accident on the city bus was merely a dream, a dream that coincided with her wetting her bed after a night of beer drinking. But, the dream that seemed so real was not too far removed from some of Nancy&#039;s real experiences. You see, Nancy had more than a few public–wetting accidents in her twenty–two years. Her dream, referred to above, was indeed based upon similar incidents although it wasn&#039;t real itself. As a youngster when playing with…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Laura Diaz rocked nervously watching Annika Sorenstam line up her putt. Diaz&#039;s bladder kept sending urgent relief signals, forcing the LPGA professional to squeeze her thighs together as best she could to hold her bladder in place. Unable to figure out why she needed to go so badly, Laura refocused on her game as Annika sunk her putt and moved away. Meanwhile, the foursome of Kelli Kuehne, Carin Koch, Beth Bauer and Natalie Gulbis paced the fourteenth green, each in their own gut wrenching battle with their bladders. Each used their caddies as cover to make a quick grab of relief in their crotch while no one looked. Kelli, glancing at the crowd, noticed several spectators bobbing up and down nervously, as they…</p>

        <p class="card-text">A few friends of mine came to me one day. They were having an argument about who was the most daring of them all and they wanted me to decide who it was. I thought that if I played my cards right I could be in for some fun. I&#039;m a guy, by the way.
I told them that I was prepared to be a sort of referee; however there were to be some ground rules. I wanted to be a witness to all challenges, or else I couldn&#039;t be fair. Secondly I wanted to stay friends with all of them so I said that I was going to be fair, and that they shouldn&#039;t get mad at me for making judgments. Thirdly– I wanted someone to be the most daring in at least 3 things, so it wouldn&#039;t be chance. Fourth– I knew two of them had a phobia and I didn&#039;t…</p>
