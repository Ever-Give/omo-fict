When out on the lawn there arose such a clatter, Our hands sprang to our pants stop the leaking from our bladders;
Away to the window we flew like a flash, And stood crossing our legs while we threw up the sash;

There was a young schoolgirl called NatWho sat in her class rubbing her twat. She liked being naughty, It made her feel horny, So she pissed in her pants where she sat!
