            <div class="mt-4">
                <p>&#8216;T was the night before Christmas, when all through the house No creatures were stirring, except me and my spouse;<br />
Our bladders we&#8217;d been filling by the chimney without care, In hopes that even St. Nicholas our pants could not spare;<br />
Then we&#8217;d nestled down all snug in our bed, While visions of sexy accidents danced in our heads;<br />
And mamma in her panties and I in my cap, Had just settled in, but for much more than a winter&#8217;s nap;<br />
When out on the lawn there arose such a clatter, Our hands sprang to our pants stop the leaking from our bladders;<br />
Away to the window we flew like a flash, And stood crossing our legs while we threw up the sash;<br />
The moon on my wife&#8217;s breasts, which were as white as snow, Gave the texture of steel to my object below;<br />
When what to my wondering eyes should appear? But a miniature sleigh and eight tiny reindeer;<br />
With a cute little driver so lively and quick, I knew who it was but couldn&#8217;t stop squeezing my prick;<br />
More rapid than eagles her coursers they came, They&#8217;d have to hurry before our bladders ended our game.<br />
And she whistled, and shouted, and called them by name;<br />
Now, Dasher! Now, Dancer! Now, Prancer and Vixen! On, Comet! On, Cupid! On Donder and Blitzen!<br />
To the top of the porch! To the top of the Wall! Now dash away! And hurry before golden drops begin to fall!<br />
I dared St. Nick, with no bathroom breaks this route I&#8217;d fly, But if I can&#8217;t pee soon, I think I&#8217;m going to die;<br />
I ate all the cookies and drank all the milk, in the morning they must be found missing, But it was a trick by that horny old St. Nick, to come home my panties almost pissing;<br />
But I&#8217;m a girl who likes her fun too; I can be just as sly, I left him with plenty to drink and a little pad lock on his fly!<br />
So up to the housetop the coursers they flew, With the sleigh full of toys and a desperate Mrs. Nicholas too;<br />
I just ignored what I heard on the roof, Because I couldn&#8217;t keep my hands off my bursting wife Ruth;<br />
We managed to stop jiggling and fondling and then we turned around, Down the chimney Mrs. Nicholas came with a bound;<br />
She was dressed scantily in fur from her head to her foot, But she looked like her panties were about to be stained with more than just soot;<br />
A bundle of toys she had flung on her back, But she had to pee so bad she almost couldn&#8217;t open her pack.<br />
Her eyes – how they twinkled! Her cleavage, how large and merry! Her cheeks were like roses but her cold nipples poked out like huge cherries!<br />
All our mouths were drawn up like cute little bows, As we each danced and struggled to hold back our flows;<br />
As she crossed her legs tightly and gritted her teeth, My wife and I kissed and wondered, is she still dry underneath?<br />
Her face was bright when she saw my wife&#8217;s swollen belly, And she knew we were planning much more fun than watching the telly;<br />
She was chubby and plump, and so sexy holding herself, My wife and I started fondling each other in spite of our self;<br />
Naughty, naughty you two she said, I&#8217;m afraid you must think I&#8217;m a flirt, Checking her panties both back and front, the trip down the chimney had made her squirt!<br />
With a wink of her eye and a twist of her head, I knew that tonight St. Nick and I both were going to have a very wet bed;<br />
She spoke not another word, but went straight to her work, And stopped only whenever an urge made her grab herself with a jerk;<br />
She did a wonderful dance while she filled all the stockings with care, With peeing <span class="caps">DVD</span>&#8217;s to watch and panties and shorts to wet on a dare;<br />
My wife and I were so horny that us she&#8217;d begun to watch, Until the pressure in her bladder made her start rubbing her crotch:<br />
Laying a cute little hand beside her nose, (the other was still busy rubbing her pantyhose), Giving her self a good squeeze, up the chimney she rose;<br />
She sprang to her sleigh with just a little spurt, and to her team gave a shout, Get me home fast boys; it&#8217;s all about to come out!<br />
Go as fast as you can, soar to new heights, They made me need Nicholas so bad I&#8217;m creaming my tights!<br />
Away they all flew like the down of a thistle, And my wife and I were back in bed faster than a missile;<br />
With a breast in one hand and her soft mound in my other, We each did our pee–pee dances while desperately snuggling together;<br />
She was leaking and creaming in her panties, I could tell she was just about to burst, In my own pants I was ready to explode, I didn&#8217;t know if I would pee or cum first;<br />
It was then I heard Mrs. Claus&#8217; call home, on the wind and just by chance, You have to hold it, Nicholas; when I get there we&#8217;ll both cum and pee in my pants!<br />
And I heard her exclaim &#8216;ere she drove out of sight, &#8220;Happy Christmas to all, and to all a wonderfully wet night!&#8221;<br />
Gotta pee &#8230;<br />
Gotta pee &#8230;<br />
Gotta pee &#8230;<br />
Gotta pee–e–e–e–e &#8230;<br />
