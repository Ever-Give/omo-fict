        <p class="card-text">Jenna arrived at my condo at 2:00 pm to watch a football game. Jenna and I worked together for a couple of years, but never dated. She was the classiest and best–looking female in the company, and was widely known for being unapproachable. When she arrived, dark–haired Jenna was wearing a black t–shirt and a pair of designer jeans that laced up in the front like a pair of tennis shoes. After watching a few minutes of the game and drinking a beer, she got a very odd look on her face.
&quot;Jenna, is something the matter?&quot;
&quot;Well, I was with a friend named Erick before I came here. We were drinking at a bar for a couple of hours. I wanted to leave, but he wanted to talk in his car. As soon as we got in his car, be…</p>
