        <p class="card-text">Ellen was a colleague of mine at a large advertising agency. She and I were competing for the same promotion. The bosses at the agency made it clear that the winner got the job, and the loser had to leave.
Ellen is a bright and attractive woman in her late 30&#039;s who was completely driven by work and success. So far as anyone knew, she had no private life. Her dress was stylish, but her in–office demeanor very prim. Ellen also never admitted mistake, nor showed any remorse. Her goal was to succeed by any means necessary. We did not work together, and our relationship was limited to saying hello to one another in the hallways.
For six solid months Ellen and I competed for the coveted vice–president&#039;s position.…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Alexandra had just finished a long day: court in the morning and clients in the afternoon. She just wanted to get home, get out of her clothes, and relax. Alexandra was wearing her &quot;court clothes,&quot; a stylish dark gray business suit, skirt, jacket, and white blouse. She topped it off with a pair of pantyhose and very high heels. That morning, Alexandra felt the need to wear something to hold in her stomach. Over her pantyhose was a long leg, high–waist panty girdle. As the day wore on, her girdle seemed to get a lot tighter. She really wanted to go into the ladies room, and tear it off. At the same time, she really liked the way it made her look.
It was after six when the final client left. Alexandra went…</p>

        <p class="card-text">I&#039;d been called in to investigate a commercial burglary. As the first detective on the scene, I walked into the second floor office. I saw a beautiful woman tied to her office chair: her arms bound to the chair arms, and her legs tied apart, also to the arms of the chair. Her skirt had ridden up to reveal some of her beautifully nylon–clad legs. She was blindfolded. There was a piece of duct tape securing her mouth. She was pulling and writhing against the restraints in an effort to get herself out of the chair.
I removed the blindfold and I showed her my badge, and her eyes signaled her relief. From under the duct tape, she was trying to talk or scream to no avail. The crime scene investigators were on their…</p>

        <p class="card-text">My girlfriend Ellen was on her way to a series of job interviews. She had on a white short–sleeved pull over blouse, a knee length black pencil skirt, and nude support pantyhose, with black pumps. She had changed her outfit several times. Ellen then called me into the bedroom. Her hands were on her stomach...which bulged out ever so slightly, and I could she you wasn&#039;t happy about it.
Ellen reached into a drawer of her dresser, and pulled out some underwear. &quot;Help me with this,&quot; as she unbuttoned your skirt and stepped out of it. Ellen then began to wriggle into this long–leg high waist panty girdle (which zipped up the side). I came over to her and hooked the side of the girdle together, and pulled up the…</p>

        <p class="card-text">We had agreed to meet for lunch. I had picked out an Italian restaurant. Melanie looked exquisite. She was dressed in a tight gray skirt which came to her knees, and a white silk blouse... She sat down next to me. We talked, we ate... during the meal, her hand found its way to my thigh... You said, &quot;You have no idea just how long it&#039;s been since I&#039;ve been satisfied.&quot; To which I reacted by feeling myself get very hard. Although I said nothing, it has been a very long time since my own sexual satisfaction.
Melanie then whispered in my ear, &quot;I&#039;ve worn something just for you. It&#039;s an all–in–one bra and panty girdle. It is so tight that I can barely breathe.&quot; What that bit of preliminary teasing she returned to…</p>

        <p class="card-text">For the last few years, I&#039;ve been sharing office space with another lawyer. It&#039;s a nice arrangement, all the office comforts with somebody else paying for half. Linda has her practice, and I have mine. We usually have nothing to do with each other&#039;s practice, or each other&#039;s personal lives; although I must say she is an attractive woman... about my age...
Not so long ago, the distance between us changed. I was walking down the corridor at the county court house, on my way to the court&#039;s business office, when I saw Linda dash out of a courtroom. She had her briefcase in one hand, and her other, much to my astonishment, holding her crotch through her skirt with the other. She was about 10 feet from me when she…</p>
