As Florence Galworth walked across the fields to Strechley Manor to attend Mrs. Millicent Blakley&#039;s &#039;at home&#039; morning, she wondered what was planned for this morning. Millicent Blakley was renowned locally for being slight unconventional, such as having &#039;at homes&#039; in the morning as well as the afternoon, but Florence considered that overall she was lucky to such an entertaining family as neighbors. Mrs. Blakley&#039;s two daughters, both comely blondes, were a renowned attraction for aspiring bachelors in the county, and Florence, who was slim and dark, and also a number of years older than the two sisters, was content to offer a more seriously minded…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Captain Holt had called over to Strechley Manor that morning to inspect the latest hunter that Mr. Blakley had acquired, and he had spent two enjoyable hours devoted to equestrian matters and drinking ale with Mr. Blakley and his head groom. Then he had been obliged to call into the house and pay his respects to Mrs. Blakley and her two daughters, discovering to his pleasure, that Florence Galworth was also present. He was given no option but to accompany these ladies on a drive in their new carriage, and before leaving, to sample some of Mrs. Blakley&#039;s tea, a drink that she specialized in providing in numerous varieties.

He was concentrating on a girl in the queue, the same as he did every night. He had spotted tonight&#039;s girl almost immediately. She was dressed for fun, all bright colors. A super–short, bright green skirt, a tiny pink bikini top, and her chestnut hair bunched up into lots of little pigtails, each dyed with a splash of purple and tied up with rainbow–colored woolly bands, just enough to let a few loose strands brush her shoulders. She had been in line for almost twenty minutes now. When John had initially spotted her she was right at the back; now she was nearer to the ladies&#039;…</p>

It had been a really lovely day. We&#039;d been camping for almost a week and Des and I were so close it was perfect! We shared everything, told each other everything – a magical relationship, in fact.
We&#039;d been together for about two years, and once – and only once – I&#039;d told him how I felt about getting desperate to pee. He&#039;d taken it well; excited even – but I&#039;ll tell that story another time!

She was sitting quietly in the middle of the boat, trying not to show her growing desperation. Birgit was part of a group of 3 boys and 4 girls on a boat trip to a small island in the middle of the Danube River, where they had visited an old castle. They had boarded the boat 3 hours ago, and since it was very hot, Birgit had drunk almost 2 liters of juice. Which was bad, because there had not been a loo on the island or on the boat. And so Birgit had been holding on since the urge to pee first hit her an hour ago. By now she was in great distress and having trouble hiding her need from the others.

Jane and her mum were visiting her aunt and cousin Katie. Jane was suffering from a temporary weak bladder problem, complicated by the reaction she had to the medication. It caused bouts of near nymphomania due to the healing sensations, which if yielded to, by masturbation or sex that involved the requisite amount of friction, hindered the healing process. So far while on her stay Jane had only found relief by having first Katie then Alan pee over her clit during sexually arousing circumstances. To insure she did not give way to temptation her doctor had insisted that she wear only incontinence panties with liners that she could not remove without assistance. It…</p>

Jane and her mum were staying with Katie and her mum for a short holiday. Jane had arrived suffering from a bladder complaint that left her with a control problem and inclined to accidents. Her embarrassing state was made worse if any sexual stimulation were indulged in– for it most certainly delayed the healing process. Unfortunately, the medication that Jane was on had a side effect; it caused vaginal irritation that nearly drove Jane to nymphomania. To make matters worse, the doctor had Jane fitted with a panty girdle that acted like a chastity belt to prevent her from scratching or indulging in masturbation. It fastened in such a way that she could not remove…</p>

I planned to leave after I finished up my job as a waitress. I packed some of my things and quietly went to bed. The next morning I got up around 9:00am. I put on a white tank top shirt, and squeezed into a small pair of shorts, about two sizes too small, showing off my body. Not needing to be at work until 3:00pm, I decided to go shopping around. After going to a few stores I was a little thirsty, so I got two beers, one for now and one for later– but I ended up drinking both pretty much one right after the other. A while later I got tired of shopping and…</p>

The image still in her mind: Lizzie wetting herself in class. Eighteen years old, rising from the chair with a sob and a big wet patch on her jeans. Hobbling to the door, hands in crotch, a wet wedge up between her buttocks. The class stunned, silent, all equally embarrassed for the unlucky girl who had laughed so hard that she peed in her pants. Jenny, too. But that sting in her fanny, the instant squeezes to hold, even if she didn&#039;t have to go to the bathroom. As if there were emotions to hold back.

When I woke up the first thought that came to my mind was: &quot;I really have to pee!&quot; since I hadn&#039;t gone all night it was time for my morning piss. Then all of a sudden I looked at the clock and realized I had forgotten to set my alarm. The time was now 8:10 and I was…</p>

Last Wednesday happened to be one of those days which I wasn&#039;t having the easiest of times waiting. By 9:30 I was almost bursting and still had half an hour to go! I crossed my legs tightly and stuck my hand in my crotch, fairly certain I could hold on.

I work in an office where we are all basically in low walled cubicles, and can see each other – except some managers who have offices – most people would know the type – glass windows but the top half is frosted.
Well, I don&#039;t think anyone notices, but from my desk I look right into the lower half of one of the females offices, right at her legs through her desk. And if she spins sideways to look at her return (one of those L shaped desks), I can see right up her crotch.
Anyway, I was working late shift (again!) and she was in there too. I started to hear her groaning, and could see her…</p>
