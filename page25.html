        <p class="card-text">Another major accident that I&#039;ve had more recently took place whilst backpacking in Australia a couple of years ago. Traveling sometimes gets you into some pretty desperate situations, but this one probably takes the prize for idiot wetting.
I had been working and traveling for about 7 months when a group of us headed up from our hostel in Brisbane to Bundaberg. This bit of Queensland is a major fruit and vegetable growing area and there is always a ton of work on the farms for skint travelers. There&#039;s a whole industry based on providing hostels for farm workers and getting them to and from jobs. But it&#039;s REALLY hard and shitty work and some of the farmers and supervisors are total mentalists. Want to…</p>

        <p class="card-text">At about 1 am, David wakes. The 55–year–old man is at once conscious of the insistent twinge of need brought on by a full bladder. He ignores it, noting the rush he gets as he grabs his stirring member to stem a stronger momentary urge. He pours a tall glass of water and gulps half of it at once while dancing in place. To the uninformed, his actions might appear at odds with sanity. He turns on the computer, checks email then browses through the special sites that interest him. The glass is empty now and he refills it. David downloads a couple of free utilities. He cannot get comfortable, dares not relax. Again the glass is empty.

Bronwyn (name altered) and myself shared the same classes from third thru seventh period. We were very close and enjoyed all the things one gets up to at that age, dating, flirting, sports and in our case living dangerously – smoking in school uniform. If you were caught, you soon felt it.
By the time our senior year class group reached the seventh form, Bronwyn and myself shared a very close bond. We could confide in anything to each other even though by then all I wanted to do was to get her naked. I wasn&#039;t the only…</p>

Should she hurry along to the toilet, which she badly needed, or maybe try and wait the half–hour until her lunch break. She had been struggling for a while now since it had been several hours since she had emptied her bladder first thing this morning at 6:30am. She usually went during her morning tea break, but today her friend and co–secretary, Caitlin, had kept her talking about her new man and her nightclub date the previous evening. Her mind was suddenly made up as the intercom buzzed.

I could not get my wife interested in it at all. One night we went to a new bar to listen to a friend&#039;s band play. Little did I know that the ladies&#039; bathroom was under construction, as it was being completely remodeled. As the night went on and we were both drinking, my wife went to the ladies&#039; room to go to the bathroom. She didn&#039;t say anything when she returned, but as the night went on I saw in her all the signs of desperation. I asked her what was wrong and she said that she had to pee!
She said that there were no stalls, just toilets with no dividing walls, and she couldn&#039;t go like that. I told her I would take her outside and let her go,…</p>

When she woke up, her long brunette hair was all in clumps, and when she went to get out of bed her pajamas caught on the bed post and ripped right at the crotch. She wanted to cry, but figured she could just sew it later. As she walked into the bathroom, she noticed all her dirty clothes lying on the floor and knew that she had to go do laundry today. She quickly stepped in the shower and washed her hair, but it was still hard to brush when she came out.
She wrapped a towel around her tight body and walked to her dresser, where she found she had no clean clothes. She looked at the dirty laundry pile realizing how bad the day was going. She picked…</p>

In other ways, however, she was quite shy, however. She seemed completely focused on her work, and I could not help wondering if she was already dating someone.

        <p class="card-text">VFA–251, the &quot;Annie Oakleys,&quot; was the first all–female attack squadron in the U.S. Navy. Flying the versatile F/A–18D Hornet, they could strike any target from tanks to ships to aircraft. The Squadron Leader was Andrea, a Navy Commander. Newly formed, they got their first assignment at sea, to a Nimitz–class carrier.
All but one of the ten squadron members flew out to the carrier on schedule. One of the aircraft had serious mechanical problems, and the pilot, Denise, had to stay behind while it was repaired, since there were no spare aircraft available. By the time it was finally fixed the carrier was halfway to its patrol station. Denise had to fly out to meet it, traveling several hours over the ocean. The…</p>

        <p class="card-text">The hallway in the school of business building was brightly lit and full of busy students as the morning classes were about to start. The classrooms in the concrete building lined the outer walls while the center core was offices and other rooms. A large twenty foot wide corkboard with notices and advertisements lay on the inside wall, across from room 304, where economics 102 was starting in ten minutes. Windows into the classrooms had curtains on them so the class had the option of closing them for privacy. 304 had the curtains open, the room was still mostly empty, only a few students had gathered to sit down. Across from 304 were the restrooms, men&#039;s on the left, ladies&#039; on the right, with a unisex…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Carly squirmed behind the counter as she handed her customer a bag, &quot;Thanks for shopping with us,&quot; she said with forced cheer. The extra large coke she had during her break was back with a vengeance, her aching bladder screaming for relief. Normally she would have been able to get someone to cover her counter for a pee break, but it was the day before Christmas and they were short people because of a flu bug going around.
Just as she thought she&#039;d make a break for the bathroom anyway, a woman came up to the purse counter she was working.
&quot;I&#039;m looking for a purse for my daughter but I&#039;m not sure what she would like.&quot;
Carly groaned inwardly. This was going to be trouble. She didn&#039;t know how much longer she…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Nicki is a friend of mine, and I had never heard of her peeing until she told me a true story she experienced.
Nicki, just turning 19, blonde, slim body, had never been in a desperate situation in her life. She woke up in the morning, just like any other morning, and she was going off campus to visit one of her friends. Her car was in the repair shop, so she had to take the bus for an hour trip, plus a long walk from there to reach her friends.
She got up in the morning, took a shower, and did all the other things a normal person would do. She got dressed in a light blue top with a black mini skirt. She used the restroom, and then consumed some coffee before leaving. It was a 10–minute walk to the nearest…</p>
