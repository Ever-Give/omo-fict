        <p class="card-text">As some of you may know, I really enjoy frantic desperation– a man&#039;s or mine. Generally I do my monster holds at home as I have never wet myself as an adult and I can&#039;t imagine the public embarrassment. I have often wondered if I am really holding my maximum when I do this, as I know that the toilet and measuring jug are near by when I am home and full.
I decided to do something different today. I went to visit a friend about 300 miles away for the weekend. We had fun but frankly, it was a little boring. So this morning I decided to set a few rules for the trip– no stopping at all– and I must consume 12 oz. of liquid every half an hour. I also knew that as I became more and more desperate the feelings would…</p>

        <p class="card-text">It has been a long weekend and I am now a bit bored. Memories from last Sunday&#039;s monster hold make me feel warm and that makes me want to ride the piss wave of beautiful agony again. I was going to give my bladder a break but an opportunity came up so, I decide to try another hold. Not as long as last week, I know that I will never hold out at home like I did in the car. Having a toilet nearby is too much temptation for me. I am going to really push the fluid though – 20 ounces every half hour, 8 ounces more each half hour than last week&#039;s hold. Maybe it will fill me fuller, faster. Here are my notes.
1 pm – I open a diet coke, a friend comes by to take me shopping. She goes to the bathroom and complains…</p>

The college girls in the red convertible had slowed alongside his service van, allowing him a good look at their bikini clad bodies as they headed for a day at the beach.

The way she had been wriggling on the seat, he believed her! Bill worked all over Southern California doing bank maintenance for a national company.

A month ago or so my girlfriend invited me to hang with her and her friends one night. They were throwing a small bachelorette party for this one girl who was getting married in a couple of months. I was to be the only guy hanging out with these women on this night. They all liked me and didn&#039;t mind having me around. I would be kind of chauffeuring them around later that night as well.
I met my girlfriend Ashley at about nine o&#039;clock or so and headed over to this one girl&#039;s house where everyone was gathering. In thinking about the evening, it never crossed my mind that being around all…</p>

They were told to arrive with their bladders full so to enable them to provide a fresh urine sample.
It is a windy rainy day and traffic is backed up for miles. Joan arrives at the office first, needing to pee very badly, although not yet desperate. She is wearing a blue sweater and dark grey slacks. She walks in trying to be as composed as possible– while taking slow, awkward steps over to the desk.

At one particular casino, which we used to go to quite often, there was a female croupier who was always very jovial and chatty, very different from the sour–faced type that many of them seem to be. Even though she (usually) still managed to take our money, it was always more fun when she was dealing, and all the regular customers knew her quite well, my wife and I included.
I&#039;ll call this croupier Sally for the purpose of telling you about the incident, she was about 20 years old, she did tell us her age once, but I can&#039;t remember. She was nicely slim and had long, slightly curly, blonde hair, and a…</p>

The following evening capped off a long day for Katie.

It was two minutes to the start of Free Hour, and Katie had been pacing furiously back and forth across the floor of her hideout, praying that Penny would be there and that she&#039;d had better luck than Katie in tracking down recruits; Katie hadn&#039;t seen Lisa or Caryn at all that day.
Her fears subsided a bit when a tall, stocky girl with blonde curls appeared in the doorway. Initially terrified…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Hi. I have been lurking here for quite some time, and love all the stories. Then I thought I should post some of my memories, as I always thought other people were rude if they lurked and didn&#039;t play &quot;show &amp; tell!&quot; So here goes.
I grew up on a secluded New Zealand farm, very steep country, but lovely native forest with sparkling streams and rivers. This story is from my favorite place in the world! It is from early on in my wetting, back when it was more fun than sexual. I hope you like it.
I guess I first got interested in wetting my panties at an early age, too. I remember growing up on our farm, and a lot of the time I would be left to my own for long periods of time. Summer was the best time of the year.…</p>

        <p class="card-text">It was 1960 when Vicky climbed aboard a Greyhound Bus affiliate that connected her hometown to the main line. It was the cheapest way for Vicky to get to Philadelphia where she had acquired a job writing copy for an advertising agency. It was a Friday morning and she had to report Monday morning at 8:00AM sharp. With the help of her parents she had already arranged for lodging in Philly and she had an advance in cash from her daddy to last until she got her feet on the ground. It was the best she could do with her recent Baccalaureate Degree in English and she was very excited about her prospects. She couldn&#039;t imagine a better starting point.
Vicky was 22 years of age, 5 feet 6 inches tall, and 120 pounds of…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Some time ago I had a temporary job trying to sell motoring services and products on a motorway service area. The marketing organization I was working for thought that motorists stopping for a break would be a soft target and a captive market. In fact it was a thankless and badly paid job, and most people soon became disheartened and left. I stayed longer than anyone, despite the miserable job, because a few of the people arriving at the service area were desperate for a pee, and this job paid me to stand around and watch for this. Below are the best of these sighting, collected over about six months, together with my thought on what I saw. All of these are true sightings, and I apologize in advance for the…</p>

        <p class="card-text">The Tappan Zee is a 3–Mile long bridge on the Hudson River north of New York City. The traffic is always backed up and since there is no way off, I have often imagined people stuck and desperate. I have used my previous characters again and you can check out my other stories for their descriptions.
George, Patty, Joan and Paula are all sitting in traffic on the Tappan Zee Bridge, all having to pee so badly they don&#039;t to what to do. They are each coming home from a long holiday weekend and are casually, but nicely dressed. Joan is wearing a white sweatshirt with a sailboat on it, a pink sweater tied around her shoulders and tan shorts. George is wearing a reddish/pink button down shirt and tan slacks. Patty is…</p>
