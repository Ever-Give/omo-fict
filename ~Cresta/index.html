        <p class="card-text">Alright, so this is pure fantasy. This is what I wanted to have happened when I was 18, because this teacher was just gorgeous
One day in 1987, when I was a young virile 18 year old, I had an experience that was to change my life and arouse my interest in water sports as my sexual preference. The last lesson at my Grammar School on Tuesday afternoons was Pottery, a subject I hated, but I was madly in love with the teacher, a beautiful middle aged Welsh lady called Mrs. Vale. I would dream about her. Fantasise about her. As always in these situations, I got the feeling through imagined body language that she fancied me and that it was only a matter of time. On that day thirteen years ago, my dream came true.…</p>

This first chapter is actually adapted from a story I found on the Internet, but I do not know the author&#039;s name or where I found it. Thus, if the author objects, please get in touch. Just for the record though, I am not making anything out of it and I hope you are not miffed that I altered your work. It just seemed to fit, is all. 
1. Margie’s First Accident Margie was enjoying the lovely sunny day. It had been a good idea to bring her daughter Jenny and their neighbours daughter Carla on a picnic. They had enjoyed their lunch and all the wine of course, and now the girls were…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Carla – The Wet Angel (2)2: Carla and Margie
That night, as Carla lay next to the sleeping Jenny, she replayed the whole scene in her mind. The point where Margie thrust out her pussy, all bulging and covered in those damn sexy panties she wears, oh it was too much. Jenny was dead to the world, so there was no fun to be had there. She reached down just on the off chance, and stroked the warm silky material between her thighs. Jenny murmured, but stayed asleep. Damn. Horny. Carla slipped out of bed and walked onto the landing. The house was silent. No lights on, and by the half light from the faraway street lights found her way to the bathroom. Closing the door, she thought she heard an odd metallic click. She…</p>
