        <p class="card-text">Gina, Carol and Fiona were 24 year old triplets, and pretty much identical. The only really obvious difference between them was their hair. Gina wore her natural blonde locks flowing down to the middle of her back. Carol had dyed her hair black and wore it to the shoulders with a severe fringe halfway up her forehead. Fiona had kept her hair blonde but had it cropped close to the scalp.
The girls were sitting in the garden of a man whose money they loved. Uncle Joe, as he liked to be known to them, was celebrating his 65th birthday and he&#039;d invited only three guests – the triplets. He&#039;d known the girls most of their lives as he&#039;d been their fathers business partner. When the girls were 17 their parents were…</p>

        <p class="card-text">I&#039;m 26, 5foot 5, 9stone nearly (120 pounds) and my boy friend is twice my age nearly. Both of us like watersports and we play almost every weekend. It was a Saturday in August 2000; we were on Robert&#039;s boat under the shade of an avenue of trees. The afternoon sun shone on a notice board saying &#039;Beware– Army shooting range&#039; so we stayed on board idly watching the ducks. My summer dress is the shortest a tubby girl can wear without looking silly. It&#039;s a pale blue with a belted waist and very full in the skirt covering my faded pink knickers by about three inches if I stand up straight.
When it&#039;s hot I prefer to do without a bra but I stick out a bit so I only pluck up the courage when we&#039;re far from…</p>

Its 3 o&#039;clock in the morning and I&#039;ve just been for a wee. As I creep back into bed, May mumbles in her sleep rolling over to deny me even the three inches of mattress she usually allows me. Carefully I clamber over her to take her side of the bunk. The duvet doesn&#039;t stretch to my new side because May has it all. Is it like this for everyone who sleeps with someone else?
She looks so sweet curled up comfortably that I haven&#039;t the heart to yank the cover over to me. My ploy is to slide very close to her and put my arms around her. When she&#039;s asleep all her actions are reflex. She mumbles again and returns…</p>

Uxbridge is some way from the center of London but it&#039;s on an underground line. When we stopped the boat there, it was convenient to have a day out in the big city. My &#039;social education&#039; started when Robert began to show me how I could dress to make better use of what he calls &quot;my graces.&quot; Then he forced me to meet all sorts of people who cruise around the canals. One of these was a professor in a London University college. We had decided to go to see him and his wife at their home in Muswell Hill.
As they are an eccentric couple, Robert suggested that dressing too elaborately might be unwise since you never knew what they would have arranged for…</p>

Visitors from other regions are frequently overwhelmed by the explosive profusion of vines and flowers covering every tree, bush, and lawn, providing not only a dazzling kaleidoscope of color but also filling the air with intoxicating scents. At night, when the whippoorwills keen their haunting refrain and the warm breeze rustles the branches and Spanish moss in the high, twisted oaks, the South can seem like a universe apart from the dirt and bustle of modern America.
I had been hired as a networking consultant at one of the most lavish country club settings in the South, far removed in distance, culture, and setting…</p>

        <p class="card-text">October 8, 2002 was a bitter day for our little software company. We had begun the firm almost as kids and soared to the heights of the tech boom not as millionaires, but amazingly affluent for young adults in our late 20s. Fortunately, we were a solid company with a good product. We didn&#039;t tank when the bubble burst, but we definitely were no longer looking at retirement in our 30s as we all had imagined.
What really stung, though, was when it became apparent that takeover by one of the larger telecom concerns was inevitable. The offer was reasonable, we had incurred minor debt, and there was no question our financial security depended on selling out to a more secure operation. We were coming out alright,…</p>

Tall and willowy with blonde hair that cascaded down her shoulders and a sweet, very white, sort of baby face and sparkling, crystal blue eyes, Robin was of German–American ancestry.
Shortly after we began our relationship, Robin boldly stated, &quot;My main desire sexually is to do precisely whatever pleases you.&quot; She was kind of a sub, but far from being passive, exhibited an extremely ebullient, outgoing personality. She cajoled me to somewhat reluctantly confess to my watersports affinity; the first time I had done so in my entire life.

It is an afternoon class and at lunchtime Irene has consumed 2 large glasses of coke and 2 bottles of water.
The first sign that the day isn&#039;t going as planned is about 15 minutes into the afternoon class when the woman sitting next to Irene, Celia, put her hand up and said to the teacher, &quot;Please Miss Jones, Irene has just kicked me under the table.&quot;

I first met her sister at the wedding. Lynn was eighteen with a slender body, usually dressed in tight, short dresses and skirts, or leggings and t–shirt. Tracy didn&#039;t mind me noticing her sister. Isn&#039;t she cute? She used to say, &quot;don&#039;t you just love her?&quot; Not as much as I love you, was my truthful answer.
The summer after the wedding we spent two weeks at Tracy&#039;s family&#039;s summerhouse by the sea. One day Lynn turned up unexpectedly. &quot;Time to check out the happy couple,&quot; she said. &quot;Still in love?&quot;

I had taken on the job of building a new terrace on my uncle&#039;s summer house, a combination vacation and summer job. Actually there were two uncles who had built only yards apart on my grandfather&#039;s land, part of the deal being that my mother got the apartment in the city. I hefted a crowbar and tried to look mean.

I turned. She was tiny, dark and beautiful, dressed in a blue micro–miniskirt and a skimpy top, sitting on the porch of the other house, looking expectantly at me.

She jumped up, came over and gave me a hug. –Terry!

        <p class="card-text">Vickie was beginning to feel a bit uncomfortable as she placed the deviled eggs onto the picnic table at her family reunion. Her bladder was rapidly filling but she had already decided that she would ignore it. She was the teenager designated to help the grown–ups organize the tables and offerings and she was determined to complete her tasks. She was, as all the other young ladies before her at these reunions, honored to take part in setting the table. And, she was determined that nothing would interfere with her enjoyment of these proceedings.
But now, she was instructed to place a dab of soft cheese on a thousand or so, she thought, small crackers and arrange them in a fashionable manner on the table. While…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Angela was a bartender at the Three Oaks tavern for ten years. She liked her job because the money was good, the customers were nice and she had lots of fun. She was divorced from an abusive, inattentive husband and she liked being single. The idea of working with and meeting lots of men appealed to her and she loved to tease them and hear their compliments, but she would rarely go out with them since Angela had a strict personal policy of not dating her customers, and besides, she didn&#039;t want to be bothered with dating anyway. She was a Bi sexual and liked the women as much as men, but Angela kept her private love life private.
She loved to tease, though, and Angie, as her customers referred to her, wore…</p>

        <p class="card-text">This is just a fun little incident that I love to think back to.
It had been after a long night of incredible (and I mean *incredible*) sex with my fianc&#039;. I woke up before he did, sat up in bed, and just watched him sleep. God, he was so gorgeous. Then, I felt the urge to pee. It wasn&#039;t too bad, just one of those morning pees. I was about to get up, but he woke up. We smiled at each other and I cuddled up next to him. He playfully started kissing me, but I was distracted because my urge to pee was getting stronger –– a LOT stronger. As he started to gently kiss down my stomach, I knew I had to go relieve myself. I think he saw my discomfort and figured out that I had to pee.
&quot;Baby, please...stop.&quot;

&quot;My troubles started when we were having a drink in the evening. I got into a stupid argument with Sharon, and we had a drinking contest, seeing who could drink a pint the fastest, and then immediately a rematch changing drinks, so I drank lager and Sharon bitter. (Sharon is a white girl who always seems to rub me up the wrong way. If I had not already been drinking I would have ignored her, like I usually do. It would have been much better if I had.) We had hardly finished that when Sister Loraine was telling us it was time to leave, and I just had to finish my drink before we left, so I had…</p>
