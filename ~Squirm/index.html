        <p class="card-text">I work in a large, and thriving modelling agency. This is close to an all female establishment, I am a secretary, and one of the two guys in the agency. The main offices are plush, and the staff look the part – power dressing is the order of the day, a business jacket worn over a lacy bra, and a neat micro–skirt. They all have tanned, smoothly shaved legs. These girls are confident, almost all with gorgeous figures, and totally professional and business–like in their behaviour.
Friday morning was the weekly board meeting, the chief executive and fifteen of her immediate underlings would gather at 9.30 and thrash out the agencies business for the past and following weeks. All 16 of these girls vanished into…</p>

        <p class="card-text">My name is Lynne and this is the story of the longest afternoon of my life. I was new to the typing pool, it was my first job, and I loved it. There were 12 of us, all girls in our 20s, and although we worked hard we had a lot of laughs. I dressed to fit in with the others – a smart brown suit with a short skirt that was barely decent. I felt good, and I looked good! Friday lunchtimes we went to the pub, taking a full hour. Colin – our immediate boss – would buy us all a drink, and we would all be a bit high as the weekend approached. The events I am going to tell you about happened on one of those fridays which started off exactly as usual.
We had our morning coffee at 11, we were working hard. Lunch was a…</p>

        <p class="card-text">We hated Jane the day she arrived in our nursing course. She was tall, blonde, gorgeous – and she knew it. She oozed confidence, and looked at the rest of us with that hint of pity that belongs to those naturally superior. She was smart too, it soon became clear that the course wasn&#039;t going to tax her much. We hated her looks, her luck, her full social life – we were polite, but bitches behind her back.
Mandy and I plotted her humiliation, but it was nearly a year before circumstances delivered us the perfect opportunity. It was a theatre attachment, 3rd day. Jane, Mandy and I were assigned to the same theatre – orthopaedics. The first case was a revision hip replacement – always long we had discovered. Jane…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Let me brag a bit about my last job – calendar photographer with three absolutely gorgeous models: Jane, Kirsty and Alison. This was a one–off commission, but as you will see it turned out to be unforgettable. Outdoor calendar shoots with models were hard work, but great fun. We would work from 8am till dusk, only breaking for refreshments. Our food hamper and icebox were the only luxuries we had – it was cool mineral water for these smooth–skinned beauties.
I quickly sussed out their routine. They would spot a house near the shoot, and mid afternoon all 3 would slip away to knock and ask to use the loo. I got to enjoy the early afternoon when the morning refreshments had clearly hit the mark, and the…</p>
