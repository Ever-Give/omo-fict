        <p class="card-text">It all happened last summer as my former boyfriend and I were making a late night car journey, taking us home from the wedding of an old college friend. Dave had drawn the short straw over who should drink with the result that he had been restricted to soft drinks, something he had been most unhappy about. Not having that problem I had drunk freely all through the reception.
The result was that I fell fast asleep, more than slightly drunk almost as soon as we set off for home some 140 miles away– a slow journey at the best of times with many quite minor roads and few places to stop. Unbeknown to me Dave stopped to fill up with petrol and use the toilet after about an hour but didn&#039;t bother to wake me up to…</p>

I&#039;ve always been into being desperate, but have always had quite a strong bladder and the idea of actually wetting myself in public has always been a bit daunting. I don&#039;t know why, but recently, my bladder seems to have started to get weaker and I have been in a few uncomfortable situations.
The other day, I was leaving the office – I drink a lot of water at work, perhaps 3 pints, and coffee, perhaps 2 cups so I go to the toilet about 6 times in the working day – anyway, I didn?t think I needed a toilet stop before I left, so I casually walked down the stairs. It was about 6pm and I hadn&#039;t been to the toilet for a good few hours and I&#039;d drunk about a pint or so of water…</p>

Kathy had invited her over for an end of semester &quot;surprise&quot; that Saturday. Sharon had no idea what to expect, but was hoping for more pee fun with her professor.
Sharon dressed herself in tight jeans which showed off her perfectly shaped athletic ass and a tight pink t–shirt under a heavy winter coat. Kathy greeted her with a hug and a quick peck on the lips at the door. Sharon was pleased to see her eyes wander over her body as she invited her in. Kathy led her to the kitchen where a large pot of hot chocolate was brewing. Sharon immediately accepted Kathy&#039;s offer of a hot drink and excitedly watched her…</p>

&quot;Well&quot;, the boy started, &quot;we do love each other, and we have been together for more than five years now. It is just that our sexual fantasies seem not to match.&quot;

She had been selected to participate in a foreign exchange program in Tokyo over the summer.

In Japan, she was living in a fourplex with Abby, a fourth year sciences student at her college. There were also Cho and Mika who were in the nursing program at The University of Tokyo.

        <p class="card-text">After my accident the first night of school, I realized I needed to put a waterproof sheet on my bed. Even though I didn&#039;t think I would need it again, the pee stain I had left was huge, and I couldn&#039;t get it out. So after my first day of classes, I went to a local store and found an absorbent mattress cover. It was actually better than the plastic sheets I had thought I needed, because it wouldn&#039;t crinkle.
Fortunately, Sarah wasn&#039;t in our room when I got back, and I was able to put my protective cover on my bed and remake it before she got back. It was a close call though– she came in about five minutes after I was done and asked if I wanted to go get dinner.

        <p class="card-text">A change of management policy in our office bought in the supposedly popular idea of casual dress permitted on Fridays, so whereas girls had been expected to wear skirts and look smart, we were now allowed to wear &#039;casual clothes&#039; i.e. jeans on a Friday. This, of course, became a sort of fashion competition among the girls, all trying to show off the most expensive and tightest jeans.
Since my boss disapproved of jeans, I had an excuse to avoid this, but, being a bit of a show–off, I tried to join in by buying a pair of black trousers, quite smart looking, in a thin and slightly stretch fabric. They fitted me &#039;perfectly,&#039; so much so that one rather catty comment was: &quot;Never mind the &#039;panty line&#039; showing,…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Turtle Island, October 1644
With only the feeble starlight, walking on the docks through the mist made Temperance nervous. Her pace kept accelerating, and soon it became even brisker than she thought possible. Cold was sending shivers down her spine but she knew she could not go faster without jeopardizing the poor balance alcohol induced. She passed by a man throwing up every ounce of liquid he had had in the night and her heart missed a beat when she twisted her ankle because of a slippery paving stone. Her squeaking out of surprise and pain was muffled by the mist but not enough. Four blokes she had not spotted at first were coming towards her with small shining blades in their hands, and dark brown rum in…</p>

        <p class="card-text">I am Kazziebabe, and these are a true stories about me wetting my knickers.
When I was 32, a good few years ago now, I was working evenings in a pub, part–time. I was separated and in the process of getting divorced when I met a really nice man. We started seeing each other and after a couple of tease–filled months we had progressed to heavy petting and sex.
On the nights I worked in the pub, I would go round to his bedsit to see him, just for half an hour or so, as we both had day jobs with early starts. We used to mostly just play manually on these occasions, saving the sex for when we had more time together.
Oooh, he was soooo good with his hands, and was very naughty, teasing me in lovely ways until I…</p>

        <p class="card-text">A few months after our soccer state championship, I was heading off to college. Though nervous, I was extremely excited to begin the next part of my life.
My parents helped me move in– I beat my roommate there, and was nearly finished when she came in with her parents. Her name was Sarah–she was a very pretty redhead. Our parents left and we got to talking– it turned out that she had played volleyball in high school, so we had a strong interest in sports in common. The girls next door stopped by around nine and asked if we were interested in going out that night. One of them, whose name was Ashley, had a sister who was in her senior year and said we could all go to a party at her boyfriend&#039;s house. We both…</p>
