She was dressed in a short skirt and tight top, had dark, curly hair, and was not very tall. Her clothes accentuated her rounded body, and her skirt rode up to reveal the top of her stay–up pantyhose. A woman in her thirties on the lookout.I was sitting by the bar, ready to be selected. I lifted my glass and nodded to her. The music was loud. She put her hands to her red mouth and mouthed, &quot;dance?&quot; and I finished my beer and rose.

It was a hot July night and a very popular band was playing at an outdoor concert in the park. My friend Jess, and our dates Mark and Brad were all going to go with me to the concert. It started at 9pm, but at about 7pm we all met at Mark&#039;s house to have a few drinks before we left. There would be a beer gardens there but we wanted to get buzzed before we got there. Since it was a warm night Jess and I were both wearing tank tops, me with a skirt and her with shorts. Both the guys just had on t–shirts and khaki shorts. We started with a couple shots each and then switched to beer,…</p>

About half an hour later I began to feel the urge to pee. I ignored it and figured we would be leaving soon. About 45 minutes later my urge was getting to a state of emergency so I figured we had better get going. I told the two girls it was time to go and they started crying and begging to stay. Marcy, my friend, said, &quot;Oh come on just let them play a bit more!&quot; I figured I&#039;d wait.
Another 20 minutes went by. I was in urgent need now of a place to pee. I knew that even if we left then with the walking speed of those kids we wouldn&#039;t be home for at least 30 minutes. It was a last resort, but…</p>

So, I&#039;m sitting here on my day off doing absolutely nothing. Well, not nothing...I&#039;m listening to music and looking at dirty pictures on the Internet. A pastime I don&#039;t tell anyone about. I also have a very full bladder...another hobby I don&#039;t tell anyone about.
I am so wet right now that my pants are damp, although I haven&#039;t actually lost control yet. Really, I&#039;ve never gotten that far. Whether it&#039;s from fear, boredom, or intolerance to pain, I don&#039;t know, but I&#039;ve tried countless times. I always end up giving in and getting on the toilet. Maybe this time...

In the bus, I was sitting next to Anna, and with about 30 minutes left in the ride, I was beginning to catch first signs of growing desperation. First she was just sitting cross–legged, but soon she started to move them against each other and banging her knees. After a while, she started to look very distressed and I asked her if she was OK. She said: &quot;Yeah, I just have to go to the toilet real bad. I hope we get there soon.&quot; This really got my attention.

One day I went to a birthday party for a friend. We had plenty of beer and soft drinks and everyone was having a good time. Nothing unusual happened until the drinks started to catch up with me and I went to the bathroom to recycle some beer.The bathroom was upstairs and there didn&#039;t seem to be anyone else around so I went in but didn&#039;t bother to lock the door. I realized that I had to poop too so I sat down and started to pee. Suddenly the door opened and a girl came in. She wasn&#039;t my girl friend but we were good friends. She had her dress pulled way up and I could see her white cotton panties. Her hand was between her legs and she was rubbing her pussy.…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Kate shifted her weight, balancing evenly on both feet, and moved her legs about 18 inches apart. It was going to happen any second now, so she tensed her muscles and really started to concentrate. The tension was slowly killing her, she could feel her muscles starting to quiver and she knew that once it was all over she could finally take a deep breathe and relax. It was coming, and there was nothing she could do to stop it.
She saw movement, her brain tracked it, and she flung herself to the right, stretching her leg as far as it would go. The hockey ball struck the outside of her pad, clipping a metal buckle, and deflected past the outside of the goalpost. &quot;Save&quot;, she thought, as the umpire blew the…</p>

        <p class="card-text">This story is based on something that happened in a ballet class I used to take. It was the first time I had witnessed a major accident by another girl who wasn&#039;t a child and I found the experience incredibly interesting.
Emily rushed into the house, running late after spending too much time with her friends that morning. It was nearing noon, but there was no time for lunch as she had to rush off to ballet class in a few minutes. Thirsty more than hungry, Emily hurriedly downed a bottle of water and ate an apple, while Mom reminded her that she was running late for class. Emily had just been promoted to a trainee with the ballet company, and the rules were strict. If you missed just one class or were late…</p>

        <p class="card-text">&quot;Can we go to the mall tonight?&quot; Kelli asked. &quot;Sure, I guess.&quot; Meg replied, figuring anything was better than sitting around the house. Being a companion/tutor (babysitter?) was boring, but Meg needed the money. Grad School was expensive, and Kelli&#039;s parents paid better than anyone else she had worked for. Meg couldn&#039;t figure out why she really needed a companion. Kelli was a senior, she thought, and should have plenty of friends for companionship; although her small size fooled many into thinking she was younger. But hell, Meg thought, Kelli was a serious hottie. Good thing her parents didn&#039;t know of Meg&#039;s sexual preferences, she thought. And tonight Kelli looked pretty good, dressed in a pair of very tight…</p>
