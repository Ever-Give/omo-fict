        <p class="card-text">My name is Rahab. It&#039;s a Biblical name, but most people call me Rae. I had a very sheltered upbringing; my father was the vicar of Causton, a small English country town in Midsomershire.
Within his limits Dad was a good father. He made me work hard at school, he encouraged me to read widely, and he was always very patient answering my questions. But it was all in the world of the mind. The fact that his darling daughter had a bladder, bowels and a womb was something he could not really get his head round.
So the bodily aspects of my upbringing were all left to Mum. Sex was dealt with quite simply; it could be summed up in one sentence: &quot;Wait till you&#039;re married.&quot; Sometimes I seemed to pick up the implication…</p>

        <p class="card-text">So there I was, my jeans drenched and tears flooding down my face – it was like being submerged under water. It was a well–lit street, and though nobody actually stared, people could easily see that I was standing in a puddle of my own urine. I had never felt so humiliated and so totally isolated in my whole life. Then Paul put his arm round me and said: &quot;Come on, Peach love, let&#039;s get you home.&quot; It was so wonderful to feel that he wasn&#039;t disgusted with me that I just cried all the more. Paul wisely recognised that there was nothing he could say that would make things any better, just shepherded me silently back to his flat.
When we got there, he led me straight into the bathroom. I pulled off all my clothes…</p>

        <p class="card-text">I&#039;ve had quite a few boyfriends, but nothing very serious. With Paul I knew from the beginning it would be different. He was good–looking, intelligent, had similar interests to mine, but above all he was kind, thoughtful, considerate. I really felt this as going to be something special.
I like to take things slowly, and our first two dates ended with no more than a chaste kiss. On the third date we went to a movie, and then to the pub. Half way through our second pints he suggested, rather shyly, that I might like to come home with him. Although I tried not to show too much enthusiasm, I accepted straightaway – indeed, I should have been very disappointed if he hadn&#039;t asked. We finished our drinks, and Paul…</p>

        <p class="card-text">I was in a huge hotel complex. In every direction I could see long corridors stretching away; there were bars, restaurants, foyers, lobbies. I could see everything but the one thing I needed – a Ladies&#039; room. And did I need it badly! I was aching with desperation. Surely there must be dozens of toilets in a building like this. I tried asking people as they bustled past me, obviously on their way to urgent appointments. But nobody seemed to speak English. I was getting frantic. But there was no sign of a toilet anywhere. What could I do? At last I caught sight of a sign, at the far end of a long corridor. But as I made my way as quickly as I could, already anticipating blissful relief, alarm bells began to ring…</p>

        <p class="card-text">I&#039;ve told the story (Patience and Prudence: An Introduction) of how my twin sister Prudence and I acquired such different toilet habits. After a wetting accident in the car, Prue became neurotic about taking precautions if she was going to be out of the range of a toilet, while I, after a very painful evening out with my boyfriend, had discovered that I had very good control and had decided not to take precautions at all.
As time went on, Prue and I noticed our different attitudes and we often used to joke about it. I would say that if Prue was going to the shop across the street for some milk she&#039;d run up to the toilet first &quot;just in case&quot; she got caught short in the middle of the road. On the other hand if…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Caroline drained her second cup of coffee and glanced at her watch. It was nearly time to leave. She had been so excited by the prospect of her day in Paris that she had woken early, and she had passed the time by having a leisurely breakfast.
She had met Bernard–Henri on holiday the previous summer, and they had fallen madly in love. But he lived in Paris, and she lived in London. They both had demanding jobs, and neither was prepared to give up their career in order to be together. So it had been a long–distance relationship. Passionate phone–calls, highly explicit e–mails and whenever they could afford it, a day, a weekend or a short holiday together. Now that the Eurostar took only a little over two hours…</p>

        <p class="card-text">I met Emily at a trade–union meeting connected to the company we both worked for. I really liked her and I asked her out to dinner. We went to a very nice restaurant I knew in central London, not too expensive but excellent food. We got on really well; we were clearly on the same wavelength. I had great hopes this might go further.
As we were preparing to pay the bill, Emily looked at me and said: &quot;Shall I go to the Ladies&#039; here, or hang on till I get home?&quot; I was rather taken aback; I wasn&#039;t used to young women asking such intimate questions. Rather facetiously I mumbled something about not having the necessary information to give an answer.

        <p class="card-text">My name is Patience and my twin sister is called Prudence. They&#039;re rather old–fashioned names; they came from a 1950s singing duo that my grandmother was very fond of. Usually we abbreviate them to &quot;Prue&quot; and &quot;Paish&quot;. But in one very important aspect of our lives – our toilet habits – they turned out to be prophetic.
Prudence and I look very similar – tall, dark hair, nice figures and legs, and we tend to have similar attitudes and interests. We even go for the same type of boyfriends. But on the all–important question of emptying our bladders, we are very different.
We live with our Mum in North London. And since she gets a bit of criticism in this story, let me just say she has been a wonderful Mum. Dad…</p>

Simon was already up, and she glanced at the bedside clock. 10:00 a.m. Then she jumped out of bed and ran to the bathroom, where she immediately dropped her pyjamas around her feet and sat on the toilet. As a powerful, apparently never–ending torrent gushed out from between her legs; she began to do some mental arithmetic. Since she had been living with Simon, she had abandoned her habit of taking a leak before going to bed. She slept like a log, especially after good sex, and never awoke till she was absolutely bursting.

In the weeks following her first frantic evening with Simon (see Sarah Stops Being Sensible – Part 1) they had had four more dates. On three of them (a girl can&#039;t be too predictable) she had got extremely desperate for the toilet and Simon had had to shepherd her to a ladies&#039; lavatory. The relationship had gone swimmingly (so to speak) and after a couple of months they had decided to move in together. They had found quite a nice little flat right on the outskirts of North London (housing in London was a real problem), of which the only disadvantage was a long journey home.

Cathy and I were together for over three years. She was attractive, warm, kind, intelligent and witty. Everything a man could want, it might seem. Unfortunately not, if a man had tastes like mine. As far as my preferred fantasies were concerned, she was a sad disappointment. She wasn&#039;t shy or inhibited in any way; she would announce, &quot;I&#039;m going to the toilet&quot; in a quite matter–of–fact tone. But that was all. Never did she admit to being &quot;desperate&quot; or &quot;bursting,&quot; or to any kind of urgency.
