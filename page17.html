        <p class="card-text">Let&#039;s see where were we? Katia and I had just soaked ourselves outside and had gotten back on the trolley. We had peed so much our sneakers were starting to squish from the pee dripping off of our jeans down into them. This was the dead of winter remember so there was no way we were getting dry, and the warmth of our pee was fading fast.
&quot;We&#039;re gonna be freezing in no time,&quot; I said quietly to Katia.
&quot;We could just keep peeing to keep warm,&quot; she said jokingly. Then almost at the same time we realized that it might not be such a crazy idea. There was no heater on the tram and people were starting to open windows and yell out them so there we were going to be freezing in no time just like Andrea. She had…</p>

She&#039;s very pretty, long tanned legs, tight ass, 36C cup, and sexy brunette hair to match her cute brown eyes. She&#039;s also very bisexual; she may even prefer girls to guys. And for the past few months she&#039;s been toying over the Internet, getting interested in the idea of being dominant and having a submissive girl. And today was the day she was going to meet the girl she had been talking with for those few months. From the pictures she saw, Christy is a feisty redhead girl with shoulder length curly hair who is athletic and has perky tits.
Lisa stretched and enjoyed the sun sparkling over her nude body…</p>

        <p class="card-text">We were looking forward to this year&#039;s Rock Festival, with a lot of new groups being expected, and a lot of old friends to be met.
We, that is, three girlfriends and me, were planning to stay for all three days, with the nights to be spent in our four tiny one–person tents. We had learned from last year&#039;s festival that we should not bring with us too many spare clothes, as there would be no time nor space to change. At least we had decided to dress a bit more attractively, after our woollen–socks–and–sandals outfit had made us kind of outsiders last year.
This year, I decided to wear a plain black skirt, a bit less than knee–long and not too tight, together with black tights and ankle–strap sandals without…</p>

My new boyfriend Joe was open right from the start as to what turned him on. The first day we went out he asked to watch when I went for a wee. I was a little bemused but I&#039;m not exactly shy so I let him do as he wished. Over time this progressed to him touching me whilst I peed on his fingers. Also he liked me to pee a little when we made love. He had a plastic cover on the bed and again I didn&#039;t see it as a problem. We had a good sex life and it wasn&#039;t that he wanted it that way every time.
One day however he confided to me that what he really fantasised most over was to have me really desperate to pee but for some reason…</p>

&quot;Practical?&quot; Andy snorted. &quot;It&#039;s so short you&#039;ll flash your knickers to the whole plane every time you sit down, and you&#039;ll freeze when we arrive back at Luton.

&quot;It&#039;s short enough that nobody will notice if I pull it out from under my bum when I sit down. That&#039;s what&#039;s practical about it.&quot;

This Monday, she would go to the beach in Tel Aviv. She left from her home in her neighborhood in the northernmost part of Jerusalem at around 8 AM, and waited for a city bus to take her to the central bus station where she could grab a bus to Tel Aviv. While waiting for the bus, she ate – and drank – breakfast: two sandwiches and a 0,5 liter bottle of Fanta. She was only carrying a small backpack with her clothing, which consisted of a pink skirt that barely reached her knees and a yellow blouse. Underneath was her bikini.

As a divorcee of 30, Lindsay was flattered when one of the younger men at work asked her to join a group of his friends going to the rugby match. The group consisted of two other couples who were all in their 20&#039;s. The other two girls were Tracy, about 25, slim with dark hair and thick glasses, which spoiled her looks, and Belinda, well built, a blonde about 28. Both were casually dressed, Tracy in the tightest pair of jeans you could imagine, and Belinda in a denim mini–skirt, which was both short and tight. Lindsay had also gone for the casual look, wearing jeans, not as tight as Tracy&#039;s with a sweater and anorak. As you might expect from a rugby crowd, they met in a pub…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Hello, my name is Anna M. If you haven&#039;t read any of my other stories, here&#039;s a quick intro: I&#039;m a girl who only pees at home, no matter what! I pee in the morning before I leave and then just hold it in till I get back home in the evening... some people call that an &quot;All Day Girl.&quot; :–)
Well, this is a story about the time I had to take an ultrasound scan last year. Routine check. As you must know, a full bladder is a requirement to take it and of course most girls just RUN to the bathroom just as soon as it&#039;s over... but I of course don&#039;t :–) Read on...
One time last year I had an appointment for an ultrasound scan and of course one must have a full bladder for it. Since I hate drinking loads of water, I…</p>

When I was eighteen, I spent four weeks in hospital after falling off a roof and breaking both arms, dislocating one and giving my back a nasty jolt. I spent quite a lot of this time with my arms encased in itchy plaster and suspended by wires to prevent me from moving them. I was lucky that my father had the kind of job that offered good medical cover, and I had a private room. To be honest, I would rather have been in one of the wards with other kids my age so that I would have had people to talk to, but since the insurance company was paying, my dad wanted me to have the best.
The hospital boasted some very…</p>

        <p class="card-text">This was the day of one of the biggest meetings in the history of the Bell–Thomas accounting firm. All of the big shots in the company were there to discuss a possible merger with Orion Corporate Investments. Of course, this also meant that meticulous minutes of all the meetings would have to be taken. Carrie Stevens was the best secretary in the firm and she was the first one called up for this most important of meetings. She had charged up for the meeting with a tall iced mocha and she also had some Coke to give her the occasional boost during the meeting.
An hour and a half had gone by and the discussion was really starting to intensify. However, Carrie&#039;s need to relieve her bladder was starting to become…</p>

        <p class="card-text">I had a really bad day at work and wanted a little evening fun; so I decided to play hold it.
I had 40 ounces of water 1.5 hours ago and a couple of vodka tonics since. I am now a girl who has got to go! I am going to hold it as long as I can and then measure my capacity. My record is 1.1L. I will try to beat it without wetting on my nice hardwood floors. If I don&#039;t make it, you will probably hear the splash, as I really let it out when I go.
Oohh my God, I am trying to hold it, but I want to pee. I refuse to loosen my belt or unbutton my jeans. Grown ups can hold it and I am a grown up, a 35 year old woman, director at a major corporation. I will not let the pulsing of my bladder control me.
