            Welcome to the archive of stories from <b>Shara and Ger's Pee Desperation Website</b>!<br/>
            Original website was available for 13 or more years and died in 2017.
            While serving as an image repository for omorashi/wetting fans around the world,
            Shara and Ger's website also had a collection of ~900 stories.
            Many people, including us, loved them and were very upset about the original website's disappearance.
            That is why we created this website.<br/>
            The website you are on right now is an archive that preserves (mostly) all of the stories from there.
            It was originally created as part of a translation project, so you might find one or two stories in russian on here too.
        </p>
        <p>Below you can find the list of stories sorted from newest to oldest. You can use page navigation at the bottom of this page, filter by author or tag.</p>

        <p class="card-text">The following happened on a hiking trip in August 2012; it is true to the best of my recollections. I have the permission of the woman in this story to post this online with her name changed (she recently learned about my fetish):Four of us went on a long hiking trip (about 15 miles) in a region that is mostly above treeline, leaving early in the day on our adventure. Three of us were male and one hiker was female. Although this hike was long, it was in a remote area and had relatively few bathrooms (one at the start and 2 others at 4 miles and 6 miles in – leaving about 10 miles without a bathroom). The hike organizer (call him &quot;Chris&quot;) made it clear that this was the case – with the implication being that we…</p>

        <p class="card-text">This story is nearly entirely fictional, with some elements of truth. I&#039;ll leave it to you to decide which is which.Chapter 1 I had about six hours left to go on my drive home. It had been raining almost the entire four hours since I started out, and since I was eastbound, it wasn&#039;t likely to let up. Since I was tensed up enough from driving I decided to pull in at the rest stop to use the bathroom, instead of just letting go in my pants like I normally would. Not another car in sight in the lot. As I got out of my truck, I saw her. She sat on a bench outside the rest area partly covered by a roof, but not completely. She was soaked from her mid–thighs down in her seemingly well–fitted jeans. Her head hung…</p>

So I&#039;m usually much more careful than I am at home. Still, I do have a story that happened to me when I was on holidays last month.I&#039;ll start at the point where I passed up an easy opportunity to pee. It was a fairly understandable opportunity to pass up because it was one of those seldom–cleaned concrete block arrangements out at the edge of a National Park. My husband Tom and I had just been for a walk through the bush, clear and wide paths, nothing super strenuous, but really nice. I had drunk a fair bit of water because…</p>

I&#039;d dressed casually for the night in light coloured jeans, a loose top and a cotton jacket. The evening started out quietly and gradually became noisy and fun without being rowdy.

She had already gulped down a large mug of coffee and a tall glass of orange juice immediately after her morning pee. She was on her way to write her last exam before a two week break between semesters. Sherry and Sabrina had been over the night before studying while engaging in some wet fun. Not surprisingly, all three girls had ended up with pissy jeans by the end of the study session. It was dark out by then so Sherry and Sabrina hadn&#039;t worried about walking home in a wet state, even with a full moon lighting the campus pathways. Maggie couldn&#039;t help but wonder if they had been seen on their ten minute walk home.As…</p>

As per company policy travel was by rail, normally a reasonably pleasant affair as the main line trains although crowded are quite comfortable.

When I got home, no one was around, so I quietly went to my room, changed clothes and went straight to bed. There was so much to dream about: wet panties, soaked pussies, and overwhelming ladies! Two weeks passed and nothing had happened. The weather was rather rainy and I had chosen to ride my bike or hitch a ride whenever some neighbor&#039;s kid had the same hours as I did. But summer came back and so did my desire to pick up my clothes. Doubtless, Mom would ask for them now that the weather allowed wearing them again.

She was a nice looking Catholic girl, outdoorsy with dark blond hair and tall like me. She seemed to fit in well, but one day a story spread like wildfire that she had tried to kiss another girl and was a lesbian.
