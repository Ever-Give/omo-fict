        <p class="card-text">Heather hesitantly stepped out of her car and walked towards the gym entrance. She felt nervous and excited at the same time. She was finally addressing her weight concerns with this three–month program. A 5&quot;9 natural blonde with a busty build, she had been the talk of her high school in her younger years. Now 28 years old and a manager at the local Walmart, she had seen her weight skyrocket nearly twenty pounds in past eighteen months, following a bitter break–up with a boyfriend of three years. Despite the weight gain, she still got plenty of lustful stares from men when she walked around the store.Heather showed her ID to the brunette at the front desk and was directed to Training Room B, down the hall on…</p>

        <p class="card-text">It all began one warm summers day during the college vacation, when my parents were away and I had the house to myself. One fine Saturday I relaxed on a plastic sun lounger on our very secluded patio with a rather raunchy book. It was hot, and to slake my thirst I had been drinking large quantities of mineral water. The sexy goings on in the book made me quite randy and I frequently rubbed myself between my legs, knowing that I would make myself come eventually but enjoying the long slow build–up.After a while I realised that my bladder was filling but was simply too comfortable, and too lazy, to get up and use the toilet. Before long I was getting quite desperate, rubbing and holding myself to avoid an…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Maureen glanced up from her computer, suddenly becoming aware that the office was strangely quiet. Looking back to her screen she found that the clock showed a quarter to seven, she was alone and security would soon be round to lock up. Still, at least she had completed this horribly complex report. Saving it, she clicked on print and leaned back in her chair.As she relaxed her concentration she noticed something else – she was bursting for a wee. Thinking back she realised she hadn&#039;t been to the loo since lunch time and, while concentrating so hard on the report had managed to suppress the increasing pain in her bladder. She often did this, in fact she was renowned for it, always seemingly able to hold on…</p>

        <p class="card-text">I should really blame my friend Sue for my crazy turn–on. If it was not for her I would still keep my knickers dry and would never have even considered wearing a nappy and incontinence pants, let alone wetting them in public. Sue and I met up at college and in our second year decided to share a tiny flat together, kitchen, bathroom, small sitting room and a bedroom with two single beds. I noticed that Sue always kept an old trunk in the bedroom securely locked but never bothered to ask her what was in it. One night we stayed in and drank rather too much wine. We began discussing holiday journeys and the horrors of coach travel. We both decided that the worst thing about coaches, apart from being cramped was…</p>

Note: This story contains Female Desperation &amp; Wetting, and Masturbation. I first discovered the pleasurable aspects of wetting my knickers while at university. It all began when I became friendly with a group of girls in the folk music club and began to frequent the various pubs in the area. For some reason cider was our preferred drink, being cheap and strong – despite its well known diuretic properties.When I first joined the group I was amused by the frequent references to ending up with &quot;cider legs&quot; if one of us drank too much. I assumed this to mean drunk, but was to find out otherwise, though our frequent visits to the ladies loo and the fact that I knew that…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Two weeks had passed since the eventful sleepover at Jamie&#039;s house. Both girls had grown to need the others touch. This had led to some incredibly risky lovemaking outside their homes– at the movies, in the quiet corners of the public library, even the bathroom stalls at school. The risk of getting discovered turned them on immensely and they had barely escaped some close calls. Jamie received a phone call from Misty the day after the wetting incident at the bar. Being the experimental type and a closet wetter for many years, Misty was dying for more fun with Jamie and Kiran. However, getting to Mistys apartment during her free hours was a difficult task for the two schoolgirls living under the close…</p>

A recent forum post asked about early experiences so perhaps I should tell about mine. I never had any problems when I was younger; as far as I can remember I never wet my knickers or my bed until my late teens, although I can recall several incidents involving friends. In most cases they wet themselves laughing, probably the main cause of accidents for teenage girls. In my case I was a poised and confident student of 19 when I first experienced the thrill and embarassment of weeing myself, though as two of my friends also soaked their pants at the same time we had a good laugh about it.

I have really been under pressure to complete a major project to get some complex documentation complete and the whole thing has been dogged by problems. As a result I have had sleepless nights and have felt really stressed out, the eventual result of which proved rather embarassing. At the end of a particularly bad week my friends persuaded me to go out for a drink on Friday night. I arrived home more relaxed and rather drunk, though not excessively so, took a quick shower and tumbled into bed. Around 6.30, half asleep and confused, I realized something was…</p>

After they walked down the stairs and into the kitchen Carie told Linda to sit down, they needed to talk. &quot;Dear, I can&#039;t thank you enough for showing me the wonders of peeing in your pants and I realise you want to do it often. Since I share that feeling I won&#039;t forbid you to wet yourself, but I do need to make a few rules for this.

        <p class="card-text">In theory it ought to be almost impossible to wet your knickers while travelling with a caravan, after all, you are towing a toilet with you! Of course, on a motorway journey there are few problems as there are plenty of service stations to stop at, though traffic jams can be almost as difficult as when traveling solo. It&#039;s the smaller cross–country roads that cause the problems. Although there are pull–ins on A–roads these are often full of commercial vehicles, with no room for a car and caravan, while on many B–roads places to stop can be very few and far between. Not useful for someone with a rather weak and irritable bladder.On long trips there have been many times when I have been absolutely desperate…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Kiran shivered with excitement as she carried Jamie&#039;s soaked bed covers downstairs to the laundry room. She could feel the wet warmness on her arms and took care not to let the bundle dampen her t–shirt. Jamie was in the washroom getting cleaned up after peeing her bed and as her first act as Kiran&#039;s master, she had instructed her to put the wet laundry into the washing machine.Kiran inhaled deeply to enjoy the scent of her girlfriend&#039;s pee one last time before tossing the bundle in. She wondered what Jamie would have in store for her– she would certainly feel compelled to get payback after what had just happened. Her vagina tingled at the thought of being subjected to all of Jamie&#039;s sexual demands. She hoped…</p>

Day 1 Finally it was the first evening of the festival. Ann and Linda had enjoyed themselves all day at the main event and now it was time to go for the walking. They had eaten at Linda her house (the four girls only, like each year, the husbands were at the terrain helping out as volunteers like each year) and now they had changed into the walking clothes and were ready to go out. They were all wearing the black glistering leggings, a lose t–shirt over it and sneakers with sneaker socks. The mothers had agreed it was a comfortable walking outfit and had happily paid for the whole package. Like each year they had backpacks with…</p>

        <p class="card-text">I am nearly 40 now but over the years I have had many little, and sometimes not so little accidents in my knickers. Most women do in my experience, though few are keen to admit it! We all find, both as teenagers, and as we get older that laughing or coughing with a full bladder causes little leaks and damp knickers, as can waiting to long for the loo when desperate, especially if you have had children. In fact I think it must be more common to leak when bursting than it is to lose control completely. If I have to hang on for long time I often find my pants are damp and sometimes quite wet when I finally get to the loo, though rarely do I notice the leaks as they happen!
