        <p class="card-text">This accident happened last summer (July 2000) and is one of only three occasions that I know of when Jennifer has had an accident in the house. It was a Saturday morning and I was being lazy while Jennifer busied herself with cleaning the house. I remember looking at her as she wiped the windows, thinking just how lucky I was to have such a stunning wife. She looked a real picture, even while doing the housework, wearing a white blouse, short black skirt, and tanned pantyhose (tights). After a while she disappeared into the kitchen and I could hear her washing some pots. Suddenly I heard a scream from her direction – from the sound of it, a real scream of pain and terror signaling that something must be very…</p>

        <p class="card-text">The following is a true and honest account of my wife, only her name has been changed. I met my wife some 14 years ago, while at the University. Jennifer was and still is a very hard working lady as well as a loving wife. She is 5ft. 10in.tall, weighs 9stone 12lbs, has dark hair and a tremendous figure. We married in 1990 and Jennifer qualified as a chartered accountant the following year. She now works for a large accountancy firm in Manchester, England. I have been to a number of professional functions with her and she has always turned men’s heads. When she goes to work she always wears a fitted suit and tights. The skirt is usually short enough to show off her legs but not so short as to make her look like…</p>

        <p class="card-text">This episode only happened 3 weeks ago so it is still very fresh in my mind. We had driven into the countryside to visit a lovely pub to have Sunday lunch. Jennifer looked terrific as always in a black polar knit jumper, short maroon skirt and black opaque tights. We finished the meal, went for a short walk (about 20 minutes or so) and got back in the car to start the 30 minute journey home. We had only been travelling for 5 or 6 minutes when I saw Jennifer fidgeting in her seat and the look I know all too well came across her face. &quot;I&#039;m not going to make it home, can you pull over?&quot; We had just reached a small village so she was hardly going to pee in front of someone’s house. &quot;Just as soon as we get out of…</p>
