        <p class="card-text">Nancy was nothing much to look at. She was short and dumpy with freckles and glasses, and cascades of curly auburn hair tumbling down to her shoulders. She always wore her skirt about four inches above the knee, even though she plainly didn&#039;t have the legs for it; and her frumpy blouses and over–tailored jackets did absolutely nothing for her figure. But what she lacked in looks, she more than made up for in personality. She was bubbly, vivacious and fun– and about three or four years older than me.
Now, don&#039;t get me wrong: I have nothing against older women, and if the age gap had been the only thing that stood in the way of my successfully wooing her then I&#039;d have been after her like a shot. After all,…</p>

What was he doing here?? How had this happened!!?? The bailiff&#039;s voice continued, droning on in that official monotone reserved for officers of the law. Finally the explanation of charges was complete and the courtroom grew tense, quiet, as the judge&#039;s voice grimly intoned. &quot;How do you plead?&quot; Paul spat out the word &quot;innocent!&quot; in an exclamatory manner. How else did they expect him to plead? They, anyone, would understand if only they had been there! Paul&#039;s mind began to replay the…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Some people discover early on their proclivities towards watersports, but I came to mine when I was in college. I was on vacation in a resort town somewhere in the Pacific. I had just received my diving certification and was eager to get to it. Before I arrived I had booked several dives with a local company, and on the day of my &#039;discovery&#039; we were to make two dives, both along the reef wall. Of course I wouldn&#039;t be alone; five others had been booked in my group. By chance I knew three of them – Amy, Joan, and Mark – they were staying at my resort and we had talked and gotten to know each other two nights earlier in the lounge.
I sat alone on the deck of the dive boat, enjoying the 45–minute trip to the…</p>

&#039;Oh well,&#039; she thought. &#039;I&#039;m already late for work anyways.&#039; She got up and felt the cool autumn breeze blow through the window against her smooth, built legs. She pulled off her sexy purple nightie and threw it on the floor. Going through her dresser, she pulled out a cute black thong with a pink smiley face that winked and said &quot;Don&#039;t You Wish&quot; across it. As she pulled it up, a blast of cold air came in through the window that made her shiver and she reached across and closed it. She then went into her closet and pulled on a denim…</p>

But she couldn&#039;t quite put her finger on what it was that was wrong. It was a sensation – a feeling – that was at once familiar and unfamiliar, but which she was sure she oughtn&#039;t to be feeling. Not here. Not now. But what was it?
She took a moment to consider her surroundings. What was the anomaly? She was in bed. Not her bed; a double bed. That was as it should be: she remembered Sam offering to let her stay for the night and showing her up to the large, inviting double bed.
There was a body asleep beside her in the bed. Jenny peeped under the bedclothes and saw the outline of two well proportioned…</p>

The 5&#039; 8&quot; tall 18–year–old college freshman was having a difficult time adjusting to life away from home.

Her busy class schedule, dorm living and pet–sitting job combined to leave the beautiful, bright, big bodied, but bodacious busted bubble–butt brunette&#039;s bladder being badly bursting before bathroom break (whew!) each day. Her bladder capacity did grow to accommodate her schedule, however, and became less a problem.

Lynn was a slender blonde with pale skin and straight hair, dressed in tight jeans and a white halter–top. Beth was shorter and rounder, with unruly brown hair to her shoulders. She wore tan pants and a flowery blouse. They were hot from dancing, and even Lynn&#039;s transparent features were slightly flushed as they walked. Feeling the buzz from beers and Bacardi Breezers, Lynn took Beth&#039;s hand and gave her a quick smile. Passing the mall they stopped to look in the windows.

        <p class="card-text">Helen sat on her rucksack, looking at her watch and tapping her feet. She was irritated. No, worse, she was angry. It was quarter to eleven. Their coach left at five to. &quot;Meet at Drummer Street at half ten.&quot; That was what Andy had said. But where the hell was he? Helen had passed on a second cup of tea at breakfast in order to be here on time. If only she&#039;d known Andy was going to be late, she needn&#039;t have done that. And it wasn&#039;t as if she needed to exercise restraint for the sake of her bladder, either. They&#039;d been assured that the Norwich service always ran the most modern coaches with toilets and everything.
A red Ford Escort clattered to a halt by the kerb in front of her. Its engine didn&#039;t sound at all…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Claire carefully adjusted her top so that it would reveal as much of her cleavage as possible, and then bent down to help little Hannah take her dress off. As she did so, she peered over the rim of her sunglasses at the handsome young man on the opposite side of the courtyard. He&#039;d noticed her, she was sure of that: but what was it he wanted to see? That was the question. Tits or legs? Well, she thought, as she gathered the girls&#039; dresses together, I can always make sure he gets a good eyeful of both, just to make sure.
&quot;Right, monsters,&quot; she said, giving Jane a friendly pat on the bottom as she did so. The girls all giggled. They liked it when Claire called them monsters. &quot;You can go and play in the…</p>

I&#039;ve been reading the stories on this site since I was 18, it was such a relief for me that I wasn&#039;t the only one who was into holding my pee till I was about to or actually did wet myself. I kept meaning to share my personal experiences but I always seemed to get side tracked. Usually when I started to tell a story I&#039;d get so excited remembering what happened that well...I didn&#039;t have any fingers available for typing ;) But now I&#039;m 23 and at work, bored a lot, and I have a little more self–control. Not to say writing this isn&#039;t a major turn on but it&#039;s not like I can just put my hand up my skirt. There are tons of…</p>

        <p class="card-text">A few weeks earlier I had played sick and stayed home to avoid an algebra test. It was now about 10:00 pm on a Wednesday, and I was in bed but couldn&#039;t sleep. I was covered in blankets and nice and warm, but not quite warm enough. I was mildly horny because of a movie I had watched before going to bed. I did not recognize the star actor, but he was hot. At one point in the movie he kissed a beautiful redhead. I must admit that during the kiss scene I was more watching the redhead than the star actor. I wished I were she. She is so hot, with such a nice body.
So there I was, lying in bed thinking of a dramatic love scene. It was just instinctive that I rub myself. I rubbed and rubbed, and got really close to…</p>

        <p class="card-text">20–year–old Shelly never could stand the sound of running water ever since she was a little girl. Even when she goes to the gas station she has to hold her crotch like a little girl because the faint sound of the gasoline running through the pump sends almost uncontrollable impulses to pee right through her. Even when she just gets done peeing, if she flushes the toilet she needs to go again; she also has to cross her beautiful legs very tightly to wash her hands.
And speaking of her beautiful legs, they look ever so sexy today. Nice and tan...you can look at them until her short baby blue fuzzy shorts don&#039;t allow you to look any more (and those shorts don&#039;t hide too much.) The shorts definitely showed off…</p>
