        <p class="card-text">Voyeurism at public library in Cape Town.
I had to take my books back to check them out again and even though it was raining outside, braved the cold and driving rain. The road was awash with water, as our long–awaited spring showers finally arrived with angry thunder and huge black murderous clouds. I made my way across the road to the shelter at the taxi stop and joined the other people already waiting there. It was a little after half past eight in the morning and so their were a ton of people moving about and I was feeling lucky to have managed to score a day off from teaching, instead of having to trudge to work through this highly inclement weather. 
At 8:35 the taxi pulled up and squeezed as many of…</p>

        <p class="card-text">– Janis McKewanI used to sit next to this adorable redhead in the 7th grade during 5th period English class and really liked her right from the first day of school. She was funny, intelligent and very friendly. She always wore a tight pair of long pants (our school&#039;s winter uniform), which really showed off her sexy curves. I had been trying to impress her since the first day in hopes of dating her, but without luck. So I jumped at the chance to carry her books to class, when I spotted her sprinting towards the girls toilets one day with all of her books in her hand, as I walked passed the staircase towards our class. She gratefully accepted and gave me a warm smile that melted my heart instantly. There was a…</p>

        <p class="card-text">January 13th 2001
The try–outs had been advertised around the school for days and on this particular day I walked into the gym to find several girls hanging around outside the locker–room. They all seemed a bit anxious and when I got closer, a plucky little blonde Chinese girl stepped forward and asked if I had the keys for the locker–room. I didn&#039;t and said that they would have to wait for the janitor, who was due in a couple of minutes. They shuffled and shifted, unhappily, as I walked on into the PE office. Once out of sight, I carefully and quietly arranged a portable mirror so that it revealed what was going on out–of–sight around the edge of the doorway in the passage. It was hard to follow any one of…</p>

        <p class="card-text">It was the Advanced Algebra exam of the year and one of the most difficult tests of that year&#039;s syllabus. A three–hour period had been given to write the exam and I expected that most would have to struggle to finish in that time as well. On top of that, the school had decided to only give a single break halfway through the exam, which meant that there was going to be a lot of fidgeting come halftime. Add to that the fact that Cape Town was experiencing record rainfalls and you had a lot of nervous students, which boded well for the possibility of swollen bladders. The students started entering the classroom about five minutes before the exam and quickly took their seats. Marsha was one of the first to reach…</p>

It happened one day during the second trimester of my sophomore year in High School and occurred at lunchtime. I had just finished eating my lunch in the cafeteria with all of the other students, when the bell went off for the next class. We still had five minutes before we would be late and so I stood up and made my way towards the restrooms, as I knew that the cooldrink, I had drunk, would be entering into my bladder soon and I was also feeling rather bloated. I wasn&#039;t particularly worried, but then I also knew that I had to relieve my bladder before class or I would have a problem. When I rounded the corner and headed towards the block…</p>

        <p class="card-text">The afternoon started off on a decidedly promising note, in that as I left the school for the train station to go back to the centre of town, I saw several girls hurrying along ahead of me and moaning at another girl, who was falling behind. She was walking with a mincing gait and her knees were bumping against each other repeatedly as she moved. One of the girls looked at her watch and then exclaimed, &quot;Come on, Santhe! We will miss the train if you don’t hurry up.&quot;. &quot;I can’t help it! I really need to pee…&quot;, she shouted back angrily and then blushed when she realised that I had heard her. She then quickly caught up with her friends and didn’t say anything more, but still struggled to keep up the pace. I could…</p>

        <p class="card-text">I regularly notice during mass that this stunning young girl in the choir at St. Stevens Cathedral is shifting around nervously from one foot to the other. Especially, towards the end of the hymns and being that St. Stevens is a Catholic church, the hymns are sung at periods right through the whole mass, which means that the choirmembers have to sit through the whole mass before they can leave their box. Normally this doesn&#039;t prove to be a problem and the other choristers are rarely inconvenienced by this arrangement, even though the masses can sometimes run for 3 hours or more on holidays or festivals. However, this poor Irish lass doesn&#039;t have the fortitude of her fellow choirmembers and this has caused her…</p>

        <p class="card-text">We were halfway through writing our grade 10 maths paper and almost two hours into the test, when Michelle started fidgetting in her chair. Immediately, the idea dawned on me that she needed to pee, but I didn&#039;t say anything. Over the next ten minutes, she began to get nervous and I knew that it was only a matter of time before she would be forced to either ask the Teacher or embarrass herself infront of the whole class. On top of that, I knew that the test was going to be 4&#039; hours and that the restroombreak was set for 2&#039; hours into the test, which meant that she was probably going to have to wait anyway. After 2 hours, she was starting to wiggle her legs back and forth frantically, which told me that she was…</p>

        <p class="card-text">In 1995, I shared an apartment with Natalie (22) and her friend, Carl (23), in Sea Point, Cape Town. Up until this point I had never seen Natalie so much as blink in desperation, which later I wrote off to her having too many inhibitions about relieving herself in public and an inherited strong bladder. So any chances of seeing her wet herself was relatively non–existent to say the least. We were lovers at that time, but she was more than likely too shy to let me in on any possible secrets. Anyway, the Gods must have been smiling on me that week in mid–October when she developed cystitis (a urinary infection – frequent urge to urinate &amp; hyper–acidity i.e. burning urine), which changed things dramatically.
