        <p class="card-text">This is a follow–up of Millan&#039;s previous story that you can find here: Scaring Myself I woke up kind of early and something felt weird. I had been dreaming about what I was going to spend the day doing, and I already had two ideas that I didn&#039;t have time for yesterday. I yawned and stretched a bit; still terribly sleepy it took a while for me to notice what was feeling so odd&#039;As I turned over I felt the plastic cover against me and I noticed that I was peeing. That&#039;s why I woke up! I was wetting the bed! It had never happened to me before, and I guess the constant bladder torturing the day before was the cause. Actually it was nothing more than a drop before I woke up but I would like to call it a bed wetting…</p>

This is a memoir of real events, which took place in the early 1980&#039;s, in the Spring, long after Mardi Gras, probably in May. My partner was &quot;Michelle&quot; (not her real name, of course), my girlfriend of the time, who became a long term friend and lover, over more than 10 years. This trip did a lot to make our relationship closer and more intimate. It happened early in our time together, probably about two years after we originally met. At that time, she was a petite, slender lady, with dark hair, green eyes, very smooth skin, and naturally very sparse pubic hair. She was so &quot;pee shy&quot;, when I met her, that she ran tap water to cover her…</p>

        <p class="card-text">The following story is a true account which was retold to me by my friend Amber. Names have been changed but details have been kept completely true as they were recounted to me. This story includes female desperation and female wetting.Amber was 18 at the time, a bit curvier/heavier with double D breasts, dirty blonde medium length wavy hair, an ample bottom and a very pretty face. We have been best friends for years so she filled me in on some of the more intimate details most friends probably wouldn&#039;t share. Based on outings with her, she has an average bladder but alcohol goes right through her. On this day she was wearing tight light washed skinny jeans and a red and white low cut tanktop.

        <p class="card-text">I met Beth on my first day of class my freshman year in 2010. We hit it off right away and would usually meet after class at the coffee shop. Beth was living in the dorms and I had a small apartment off campus. One day while on our way to grab some lunch Beth said we better hurry as she needed to go to the bathroom and if we didn&#039;t soon get there she might wet her pants. I immediately took notice as I was not only a secret bed wetter but I have enjoyed peeing my pants since I was in elementary school. I quickly agreed with her and said that I also had to pee badly and didn&#039;t want to have an accident either. Beth laughed and said,&quot; I know as I have had a few accidents&quot; and I said &quot;I know, me too&quot; and I told her…</p>

Despite the water I didn&#039;t feel any need to pee before we left and nor did Jane so neither of us visited the ladies.

        <p class="card-text">It was the beginning of the new year, and the end of our vacation away from the real world. We were on our way back to Virginia, Chris and I, and it was a awful day, dreary and rainy, to match our mood. Neither of us wanted to leave North Carolina and go back to our jobs, to not seeing each other every day. I had decided that morning, after a particularly rousing round of morning sex, that I would indulge Chris&#039;s little fetish and not go to the bathroom until we arrived home that evening.
