        <p class="card-text">A Walk through TownMy name is Debra and I’m in England. I am in my late 20s.
Yesterday I really needed cheering up, something to distract me for a while, so I drank as much tea and water as I possibly could. Then I put on a mid– length blue skirt with my red silky shorts, and underneath those, I wore a pair of brand new dark blue lace knickers as well. I walked into town, as there were several things that I needed to do – go to the post office, take a prescription in, etc… By the time I got into town I was bursting to pee, but I ignored it and carried on with walking about the town. I was in agony but enjoying it, though I had to keep stopping continually and I must admit that when no one was looking I had to…</p>

        <p class="card-text">This true story happened to me in October 1999 while in Basildon, England.
I traveled to a small village in Basildon. The purpose of this visit was to film someone as they left a building on my camcorder. Fortunately for me, the building in question was about 50 yards from a railway station, so I knew I could sit and wait at the station without looking suspicious. I arrived at the village around lunchtime, which gave me a couple of hours to kill. I was wearing black jeans, a red sweater and new trainers, and as this is England, I had my coat on, too. I wasn’t prepared for the fact this was only a tiny village and not much was in it. I decided to take a walk around and see some of the next village when I…</p>
