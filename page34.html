        <p class="card-text">It was the annual festival, with music and fairgrounds and beer tents and the usually inadequate toilet facilities. Becky knew she had waited too long.
After a couple of beers she had felt the need to go, but deep in conversation she had put it off. As she finally headed for the porta loos she realized the queues had grown in proportion with her need. Sighing, she took her place at the end of the line.
Becky was a short girl of twenty–nine, dressed in very tight white pants and a blue tee shirt. Her body was round in the hips, but she had a narrow waist, although her belly echoed the roundness of her bottom. With short brown hair and a nice smile she usually made friends fast. She put her weight on her other…</p>

        <p class="card-text">For the past 2 years I have been surfing around on the Internet in the search of real desperation and sometimes I have gotten in touch with girls who like it too.
On one particular day I was busy reading and writing a lot of SMS messages using my mobile phone with a nice girl who was very curious about my actual situation.
So, after work I decided to go to a bar (pub) to meet friends and to drink some beers. After a while I had to pee but decided not to go to the bathroom and thought that I would try to leave the bar at the point where I could just imagine making it all the way home.
I always take the train and the bus to go to work and that day wasn&#039;t any different. It was evening and beginning to get dark…</p>

I&#039;m twirling around, somewhat slowly, finishing a decidedly amateur version of a camel back spin, the announcer blaring that &quot;open ice is over&quot;. The other skaters begin to clear the ice, the overprotective mothers hovering over their next superstar wunderkind child, the harried parents yelling at their hopefully NHL destined little boy, the romantic couples skating a few extra laps lazily around the rink, arm in arm, seemingly oblivious to the announcers call. The dusk sky slowly rolls in, yet it&#039;s still somewhat warm out. The rink, a public outdoors facility, shuts down early on Fridays for maintenance. I&#039;m still amazed they kept it running today. While the ice was a little slippery,…</p>

The strong smell of chlorine fills the air. The concrete walls echo with the screaming of children, teens and nervous parents. It&#039;s two o&#039;clock and my shift is over. I survey the scene on this busy Saturday; take the empty water bottle with me as my replacement shows up. As I climb down the ladder from the watch chair I&#039;m aware how badly I need to use the bathroom. No breaks today, another lifeguard called in sick, and it&#039;s been four hours without a pee break, and with as much water as I had, I&#039;m about to burst. My red lifeguard bathing suit fits tightly over my 5&#039; 6&quot; body, my long dark hair tied up in a bun. I fidget as I sign out, the tight fabric of my bathing suit clinging to my…</p>

Anyway, this one girl was consuming a copious amount of alcohol and we all know what that does to people. It lowers your inhibitions and makes you have to pee every 10 minutes.
Meg, the girl in question was always a bit of an exhibitionist and quite open about her body. We were all gathered around the fire and she kept saying &quot;man I really have to pee.&quot; After about the 4th time she said this she said &quot;Fuck it, I am just gonna go right here&quot; so she stepped back about 3 feet from the fire, turned her back towards us and let rip one of the most powerful streams I have ever…</p>

        <p class="card-text">After what had seemed like an interminable Friday of classes at the NYU Downtown Campus, Katie McDonald, a 21–year–old graduate student in political economics, neatly arranged her books and materials in her tote pack and strode confidently out toward Washington Square. During the walk, she exchanged pleasantries with her classmates Rita Kudner and Boyd Hamilton, though declined an invitation to a student sleepover at someone&#039;s parents&#039; house on the Upper East Side. Katie had other things in mind.
Nearing the park, Katie managed to disengage from Rita and Boyd, who were heading for the subway. She strode over to a bench on the west side of the park, straightened her medium–length navy blue skirt and India…</p>

        <p class="card-text">The most daring I have ever been was in July of this year. It was a Sunday afternoon, chilly but crisp and clear. I was sitting on the balcony of my apartment, drinking beer with my new flat mate, Anna. We were chatting away comfortably when she mentioned the time she had wet herself after a university pub–crawl. I was instantly aroused, and tipsy enough to press her for more details. Anna was very obliging, in no way guessing that she had inadvertently stepped right into the territory of my secret passion. Then she turned it round, and asked me when I last had an accident. I couldn&#039;t tiptoe round the issue, for the beer had made me alarmingly honest. I felt myself go bright red, and Anna, realizing straight…</p>

        <p class="card-text">This is another little vignette that takes place in ca 1930 at the vast, pastoral estate in England known as Bish Manor.
We begin with Derrick, a tall, thin, respectable no–nonsense type. He was a handsome gentleman, and was avidly involved in the social circles, attended all the parties, and kept himself at all times blithe and charming. After all, one never knew where one&#039;s future fianc&#039;e might be lurking, and marrying well was an object most sought after by his crowd.
He thereby began his day, an outing to Bish Manor, with a bright and innocent temperament. There was nothing more on his mind but than to get nicely sloshed, play a little cricket outdoors with the fellows, have a good cigar and do a spot of…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Gillian sat in the bus shelter with her flat mate Linda. The party was over, it was late and she had to pee like crazy. Pulling down on her short black mini–dress, she crossed her legs and put her purse in her lap. Linda glanced at her. Gillian smiled and rocked a little. –Got to go, she said.
— Me too, Linda admitted, sitting on the edge of the seat with arched back. Her low–cut jeans revealed red thong panties where her tight sweater didn&#039;t reach.
Gillian rose, hoping standing up would ease the pressure. It didn&#039;t. She rocked on her feet and rubbed her belly. –I really have to go, she said.
Linda just bit her lip and squeezed her knees together.
— And if I go behind those bushes, the bus will come and I…</p>
