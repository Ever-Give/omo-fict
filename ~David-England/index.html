Going on holiday to Cyprus was supposed to be so much fun! My friends, Alice and Barbara had talked me into the idea, but I had my doubts from the start.
&quot;Come on Janice, why don&#039;t you join us on holiday before we all go off to university! It will be great – promise you!&quot;
The first day was quite nice, exploring the coast, and lazing in the warm sun, but I found the evening hell! To be honest, I guess I was just not very good at mixing with people, and I really couldn&#039;t bear the idea of getting disgustingly drunk!
That first night we all three went into Paphos town and ended up at a big, noisy disco–bar…</p>

        <p class="card-text">I had known Alice&#039;s secret for almost two weeks by now, and I still did not know what to do!
I was working in a PC repair shop as a summer holiday job. After doing any hardware repairs, we would regularly scan the PC&#039;s for viruses and other dodgy software. Of course, we found all sorts of other things on people&#039;s hard disks, but unless it was illegal, we never even mentioned it to the customer. Of course, if anything illegal had turned up, it would have gone straight to the police – but that left a lot of other interesting things!
This particular customer, called Alice, had brought her PC in because it was freezing every few minutes. Alice said her PC contained her university work, and she was quite…</p>

        <p class="card-text">We were falling in love...all we needed was a jellyfish!
It had been a beautiful day. A group of us from work had gone for a long ramble along the coast. We were at a place called &quot;Yorkies Knob&quot; (no kidding!) near Cairns in Australia. We had had lunch under some trees listening to the endless roll of the surf. Of course it was hot, and fortunately, we had taken plenty to drink.
After lunch we all seemed to split up a bit. I realised afterwards that my friends had sensed that Alice and I needed a bit of time alone even before we even knew ourselves! Alice has lovely long dark brown hair, and an incredibly sweet smile – I always go for the smile! To be honest, I&#039;d rather assumed that she had a boyfriend…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Let&#039;s just say, I wish this story were true!
I met Mary in an undergraduate maths lecture. I had noticed her since the start of term. Her long brown hair and fresh complexion made me catch my breath every time I saw her. That day, I managed to sit next to her at the lecture, and I remember being surprised that she wore a very alluring scent to lectures. Most female students left that until evening time!
In other ways, however, she was quite shy, however. She seemed completely focused on her work, and I could not help wondering if she was already dating someone. As luck would have it, I got to talk with her and discovered that although she certainly knew more math than me, she was having some trouble with her…</p>
