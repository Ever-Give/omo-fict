        <p class="card-text">This happened on St. Patrick&#039;s Day of this year. I have been too busy to write it up until now, but here it is.
The St. Patrick&#039;s Day Parade is a huge event and thousands of people come out to see it. People are drinking from the early morning and it&#039;s basically a huge party. Due to all of the drinking, there are thousands of people that need to pee. The really good thing for a pee enthusiast is that there are no outdoor porta potties set up, which is really surprising when you think about it. All of the people have to pee in a few restaurants that are open and allow the public to use their bathrooms. If you scout out these restaurants, you can see some great desperation sightings. 
The best one of the day…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Pam is a secretary at the company that I work for. She is really hot. She is about 23 and has long, brown hair and deep, beautiful brown eyes. She has an unbelievable body. She is about 5&#039;7&quot;, 110 lbs., long sexy legs, an incredible tight round ass and huge, firm boobs. Yesterday was the day before Thanksgiving, so it was a casual dress day. Pam had on a tight pair of faded blue jeans and a sexy tight pink top. She was also wearing a pair of black platform shoes that are so popular these days. She looked totally hot! 
Anyway, it was about four o&#039;clock and most of the people had already gone home because we were let off early due to it being the day before Thanksgiving. I was still there because I needed to…</p>

        <p class="card-text">This story is partially based on a true event.
Karen is a commercial real estate broker. She is about 28 years old, has long brown hair, green eyes, a very sexy smile and a great body. She is thin, though she has very nice boobs for her size. But what I really love about Karen is her slender waist, long legs and firm little round ass. This day Karen was wearing tight jeans and a light grey, fairly tight sweater. She had on a pair of black platform shoes. She looked very hot, as she always does. 
One this particular day, I was to meet Karen at the coffee shop near her house. I got there and Karen was already there drinking a grande latte (not sure of the proper spelling). Anyway, she had been there for a…</p>
