        <p class="card-text">Hi, here is a story (mostly true, but enhanced a little) about a girl I used to know.
We had been going together for a few months and watersports had been mentioned and we experimented a little, but nothing substantial. Her name was Jill, and she was beautiful. She was about 5&#039;7&quot; tall and had long beautifil legs, long dark brown hair and a slim but great figure. jill was very sexual by nature, as was her own contention, and we enjoyed some wonderful sex.
As I said we experimented with some peeing....she would pee on me and I on her and it was o.k., but I finally told her one day thet I was really into desperation. We had been partying....we both took the day off and decided to just hang out and drink beer...…</p>

        <p class="card-text">We were halfway through writing our grade 10 maths paper and almost two hours into the test, when Michelle started fidgetting in her chair. Immediately, the idea dawned on me that she needed to pee, but I didn&#039;t say anything. Over the next ten minutes, she began to get nervous and I knew that it was only a matter of time before she would be forced to either ask the Teacher or embarrass herself infront of the whole class. On top of that, I knew that the test was going to be 4&#039; hours and that the restroombreak was set for 2&#039; hours into the test, which meant that she was probably going to have to wait anyway. After 2 hours, she was starting to wiggle her legs back and forth frantically, which told me that she was…</p>

Up until this point I had never seen Natalie so much as blink in desperation, which later I wrote off to her having too many inhibitions about relieving herself in public and an inherited strong bladder. So any chances of seeing her wet herself was relatively non–existent to say the least. We were lovers at that time, but she was more than likely too shy to let me in on any possible secrets. Anyway, the Gods must have been smiling on me that week in mid–October when she developed cystitis (a urinary infection – frequent urge to urinate &amp; hyper–acidity i.e. burning urine), which changed things dramatically.

        <p class="card-text">This is a true story that just occurred this weekend. ( february 20, 2000 )
My wife and I have been enjoying her peeing activities for quite a few years. At first she wasn&#039;t comfortable with the idea of wetting herself. After a few years of gentle persuasion and a few genuine accidents she finally would wet herself, but only if I asked. Actually this was working out O.K. All I had to do lately was to ask her if she wouldn&#039;t mind wetting her panties at work, home or wherever and she would do so. She actually wet herself at work without asking quite a few times. She developed a pattern of wetting while waiting at the Xerox machine. She almost always wears a skirt so she was O.K. with it as long as it didn&#039;t …</p>

My life long girl friend &amp; I where on our way from Atlanta Ga. to Panama City Fla. one summer to attend the graduation of one of her siblings from Gulf coast Jr. College. It was a gorgeous day and we where riding in her 1987 Nissan Pulsar. The T tops where off as we drove down the four lane secondary road. We had dated off and on for 5 years and presently where dating after a particularly nasty breakup. Her sister (who I gotten along with) had invited me personally so it made sense that Sandy &amp;I drove down together. 
We drove her car because of the T tops and the ideal weather. A shortcut dictated we leave the interstate and proceed onto a 4 lane secondary road. As I was becoming aware of a…</p>

The flyers we each received told us to arrive at the camp no later than noon, so I began to hurry as it was already 10:45 and it takes about 45 min. to get there, not including picking Jenny up. I called her back and told her that I would be there with absolutely NO time to spare so she should have breakfast and be waiting…</p>

Pam and I have been friends for years, and during that time I had introduced Pam to the great out doors. As a city girl she had never been camping, fishing or even spending time in nature. One of Pam&#039;s favorite pastimes together was to go to a near by lake and just kick back and relax.
We had been at the lake all day, swimming, and just hiking in the woods that surrounded the lake. We brought some beer like always and had been drinking it right along. Pam can drink here share of beer and hold it right up to the point that she has to pee for the first time. From then on, she is a regular &quot;Old Faithful&quot; about every 15 minutes or so and she had watered her fair share of the trees that day. The…</p>

I insisted she stop and explain herself. But she was in the bathroom, already tugging her panties down and her skirt up, pee squirting from her cute little bottom even before it touched the toilet seat. In the quiet bathroom the hissing sound seemed as loud as the brakes on a bus. She closed her eyes. She looked very drunk. &quot;Oh, I didn&#039;t think I was going to make it,&quot; she said. She parted her legs slightly, closed her eyes, and leaned her head back. Through the narrow gap between her legs I could see her stream shooting straight forward, nearly…</p>
