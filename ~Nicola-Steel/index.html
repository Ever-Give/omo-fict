        <p class="card-text">Our day at the sea had started with some drama, as the planned &#039;comfort stop&#039; on the journey to the coast had been arbitrarily cancelled, despite some teachers being in need of such a stop. While we had been able to hold out until our final destination, a closed pubic loo had only made our plight worse, and, I am ashamed to have to admit to this, I, and my companion teacher, Kathy, had both been forced to squat in public, or near public, and pee. I can only speak for myself, and say that it was a real emergency situation and it had been a case of &#039;anywhere is better than wetting my knickers? and from Kathy&#039;s behaviour, she had been in a similar state.

        <p class="card-text">As many of you will know and expect, a small bladder such as mine and a coach outing is not a good combination, and since my early teaching days I have always been wary of school outings in coaches, which seem to have become and end of term tradition, despite all the changes in the education system.
My school is no different, and though we try to make some of the outings &#039;educational,&#039; others are purely for fun, and it was one of these fun outings that I volunteered to organise, not because I wanted the extra responsibility, or to advance my career by giving up my time to do something for the school, but for the selfish reason that I wanted to be in charge of when and where we stopped on the way down to the…</p>
