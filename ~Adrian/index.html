        <p class="card-text">Bright sun shone over the fields that mellow spring Saturday morning. Anne felt a quiet sense of satisfaction as she drove homewards. She&#039;d busily spent the morning helping her best friend Wendy host a coffee morning and had poured countless cups of coffee. The purpose of the coffee morning had been to raise funds for new loos for the community hall in Wendy&#039;s village. It had to be said that the old ones had become rather grotty and badly needed replacement. The sooner funds could be raised; the sooner work could begin on replacing them. Anne only ever remembered using them once – during the interval of a concert – and on that occasion she&#039;d needed to do more than pee. Had she only needed to pee she&#039;d have…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Anne fought her way determinedly through the crowded supermarket aisle. Necessity, not choice, dictated that she undertake the weekly shop now rather than at a time which she knew would be much quieter. Since Brian had become mayor – and she his mayoress – the days and weeks had become so much busier and she&#039;d felt that her life was no longer her own. Still, his mayoral year was more than half over and she looked forward to May when he would be handing over the reins to someone else. He was rather enjoying his spell as mayor and had expressed the view that he wouldn&#039;t mind standing for a second term in the absence of too much competition – and there wasn&#039;t much. Anne, however, had put her foot firmly down.…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Returning home at five thirty, Anne stripped off, throwing her blouse, damp skirt, and sodden knickers into the laundry basket. Lighting a couple of scented candles she ran herself a warm, soothing bath with plenty of foamy bubble bath in it. After the day she&#039;d had, she definitely needed to pamper herself a little. She wasn&#039;t bitter or angry about what had happened – neither did she feel any self–reproach. Since the events of lunchtime she&#039;d had plenty of opportunity to pause and reflect. The painful, unpleasant, and humiliating experience of tumbling on the office stairs and wetting herself in front of Clive had actually helped her to clarify and resolve matters of which she&#039;d been aware for some weeks but…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Anne&#039;s fingers flew across the keyboard at a rate of knots. Sally, her colleague, was on holiday in Cromer and so instead of working her usual three mornings, she&#039;d been asked to put in a full five–day week. Clive, her boss, was throwing work at her from all directions and it was proving difficult to keep up, let alone maintain a sense of composure. She paused momentarily, draining the last drops of coffee in her cup – the fourth she&#039;d had that morning. Excessive though it was, she needed all those infusions of caffeine, a necessity just enabling her to keep going, especially as the week was ending and fatigue was starting to set in.
Looking at her watch she noticed that it was ten past twelve. Another five…</p>
