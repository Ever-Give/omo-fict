        <p class="card-text">Jenny closed the door to her room, her heart beating. She leaned her back against it, knees tightly together, chest heaving. These strange feelings! The image still in her mind: Lizzie wetting herself in class. Eighteen years old, rising from the chair with a sob and a big wet patch on her jeans. Hobbling to the door, hands in crotch, a wet wedge up between her buttocks. The class stunned, silent, all equally embarrassed for the unlucky girl who had laughed so hard that she peed in her pants. Jenny, too. But that sting in her fanny, the instant squeezes to hold, even if she didn&#039;t have to go to the bathroom. As if there were emotions to hold back. On her way home, trying to imagine what it was like, the stream…</p>

        <p class="card-text">I shouldn&#039;t be in this situation. I mean, I&#039;m a big girl, doing well at work, mother of two, knows how to plan for the future. I shouldn&#039;t be in this situation. The subway moves into the station, doors open. Unfortunately it&#039;s not my station. Like I said, I&#039;m not the one who gets herself in a predicament like this. I&#039;m used to thinking ahead, both at home and at work, and I know that certain things are to be taken into consideration at an early stage. But now I&#039;m sitting here, staining my muscles, wishing I&#039;d taken the necessary steps. Oh Jesus, I nearly... I was late out of work. You know, just this, that and then something else. Always the one who has to finish things properly. Oh, the time. My train! Better…</p>

        <p class="card-text">She was sitting on the steps just around the corner from the club, head back against the wall, a small sack halfway off her shoulders, belly bared, and with a small pool under her butt. Melanie stopped to look at her. Late teens, probably, left behind when drink had gotten to her head and her companions wanted to party on. A pretty girl, long–limbed, with straight fair hair and a pale complexion; she looked almost transparent in her vulnerability. The dark stain on her jeans added to the helpless look. Melanie bent to shake her shoulder. &quot;Hey. Please, wake up.&quot; The girl moaned. &quot;Come on. You can&#039;t sit here.&quot; She opened a pair of round blue eyes and looked up at Melanie. &quot;What&#039;s...? Where are they? Who are you?…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Cecily and I were out Saturday dancing, going easy on the drink, but enjoying the motion and heat. As usual, she was dressed in her favorite outfit of dark panty hose under a very, very short miniskirt and a halter–top that left her navel bare. She wore her long brown hair in a rugged ponytail, making her look younger than her twenty–eight years.She wiped the sweat from her forehead as we returned to the table, heading for a cold coke. The place was quite crowded, and a group of people had sat down right next to us. Cecily nodded at the girl beside her, stretched her legs under the table and finished the coke. The girl turned to us, saying she hoped it was OK to sit there. It turned out she was not with the…</p>

        <p class="card-text">There comes a time in all relationships when the big question is asked. It may be after sex, or when waking up in the morning, or after a few drinks in the evening. The circumstances seem right when she fidgets, or moves her legs, or pats her belly, or seems to look at the door while mumbling I&#039;m sorry, where&#039;s the – I&#039;ve got to... Then comes the question: –Can I come with you? Some girls just stare at me. Some laugh. Some giggle and shake their heads. Some need to be convinced. Some girls look me in the eyes and nod. Sheila was the shy one. After being asked ten times she finally said OK and blushed. She worked her panties down under her long skirt, covered the bowl with it, and blushed again when she heard…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Jennie was walking home through the silent streets, her face flushed from dancing and enjoying herself. Dressed in dark stretch pants and a black top exposing her midriff, with her shoulder–length brown hair waving ever so slightly with her steps. Time and again she touched her belly with her hand. The guys were OK, she had been on the floor almost all night, and she knew she didn&#039;t have to go anywhere alone afterwards if she didn&#039;t want to. But she had other desires.Actually, she would have preferred dancing close to another girl; feeling breasts against her own and a rounded bottom under her hands. The tingling sensations made her squeeze her legs together as she walked. She had slept with boys, and enjoyed…</p>
