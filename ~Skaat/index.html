Episode 5 – Wet by Dawn
Laurie&#039;s jeep stopped with screeching tires in front of the fraternity house where the big party was being held. She and Cathy had been able to hear the music from down the road, but they weren&#039;t there to party. Cathy jumped out of the jeep immediately as it came to a halt and crossed her legs with both hands grabbing at her crotch.
&quot;I don&#039;t care what you say,&quot; she snapped at Laurie, &quot;the first thing that I am going to do, is go to the bathroom!&quot;
&quot;That&#039;s where we have to go,&quot; Laurie replied as she got out too and walked toward the entrance with her thighs clamped tightly together all the time.
&quot;You&#039;re not kidding!&quot; Cathy followed her without…</p>

Episode 4 – The Wet Zone
As Laurie&#039;s jeep was riding over campus grounds once more, she had some trouble keeping her mind on the road. Laurie sat fidgeting in her seat, trying to keep her feet on the pedals; she was wearing sandals, and she could see her toes curling in them. Her white cotton panties were already wet with sweat, partly from the heat, partly from the excitement but mostly because she was holding her sphincter muscle closed with all the strength in her body. Laurie was wearing a pink dress with a flower pattern, and both her thighs were pressing hard against each other through it; the soft fabric was the only thing that prevented her equally sweaty legs from…</p>

Episode 3 – &#039;Till Wet do us Part
Laurie&#039;s jeep stopped with screaming tires at her sorority dorm. The door on the passenger side swung open immediately, and Kitty jumped out; her jeans were thoroughly soaked, she had already peed in her pants on two separate occasions but her bladder still wasn&#039;t empty – and her need remained. She took a few steps towards the dorm, but then looked back to see what was keeping the others. Laurie was helping Cathy, who was still crying and sobbing –as she had been all through the drive over here–, out of the car. She was trembling, clothed in nothing but a soiled T–shirt and her soaking wet panties. &quot;Will you hurry up!&quot; Kitty screamed, &quot;I still…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Episode 1 – Dawn of the Wet
Laurie was a college student, a respectable girl with shoulder–length blonde hair and a perfect attendance record. Her friend Kitty was something else: she was a bit of a rebel who would rather be attending a party than a lecture. The girls were close friends since childhood, however, and were now roommates in their sorority. The night after the last of their final exams there was a big party at a friendly sorority house, and both girls were going. Under the light of a full moon Laurie drove her jeep through the fields on campus; the sorority houses were quite far from each other, so it was quite a drive. Kitty was fidgeting in the passenger&#039;s seat, and Laurie knew from experience…</p>

Episode 2 – Return of the Living Wet
Each time there was a party on campus, one of the sorority members had the duty to stay in the dorm to ensure security and to open the door for fellow members who came home. This night, the victim was Cathy, not exactly one of the more popular girls although she was quite attractive, but her general attitude and interest in sports (she was on the hockey team) made the other girls have doubts about her sexual preferences. Cathy woke up in the middle of the night. She was certain she had heard something: a loud sound, like someone banging on the plumbing. None of the other girls had come home yet, and although she always had a butch exterior…</p>
