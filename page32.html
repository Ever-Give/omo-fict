        <p class="card-text">As a South African working in England, Sonia wanted to see her national team when they were touring, and she was delighted when one of her office colleagues, Tony, a dedicated rugby fan, offered to include her in the party he was organizing to the England v. South Africa match at Twickenham. Tony was a regular at Twickenham internationals, and the group followed his usual plan to avoid the worst of the crowds– travel by public transport, stop at a little–known pub, and then walk to the ground. As well as Tony and Sonia, there were two other couples, both about Tony&#039;s age, while Sonia was about ten years older. She was a tall, well–built, girl of 35, with short blonde hair, and was wearing a knee–length tweed…</p>

Part Two
This picks up where Part One left off, obviously. So if you haven&#039;t read that, scroll down and catch up on your reading. This part will make a teeny bit more sense, maybe not much, but some. This portion here contains a little bit of, shall we say, consensual roughness between the two imaginary lovers. If you&#039;re uncomfortable with that, move on. Or even if you don&#039;t think you like it, try reading it. Gosh, you know sometimes we&#039;re surprised at what we find out about ourselves.

&quot;I&#039;m totally serious. No more until we get home,&quot; I said. But looking down at your skirt, already soaked in various places, I knew I&#039;d never be able to tell if you were behaving.

        <p class="card-text">At the time it seemed the logical thing to do – but trying to persuade my wife was another matter!
We had been at the beach for a few hours already and after a couple of bottles of cool water, we both needed to pee badly. Trouble is, my wife isn&#039;t one for peeing in public – even in the sea – so she sat there fidgeting while we discussed what to do. There were basically three options. One – she could go into the sea and pee while pretending to swim or paddle or whatever it is people do when they pee in the sea. Two – we could leave the beach, return to the car and find a rest area nearby that had toilet facilities. Or three – she could pee where she was, sitting next to me, onto the towel that was still damp…</p>

Once or twice members of the Gang were hauled before the headmistress, but it didn&#039;t make any difference.

It was a chilly autumn Saturday. Football season had ended two weeks ago, and the students from State U didn&#039;t have much to do. A gang of four senior girls decided to liven things up by having a beer–drinking contest.
Susan, a local, was what might be called the leader of their clique. Her companions were from different parts of the state. All were interested primarily in boys except for Sally, who secretly preferred girls. Sally and Gabriella were brunettes; Susan, a blonde and Theresa had auburn hair. They had the typical, budding physiques of young womanhood, average height and weight. Boys found them sexy in their tight jeans.

There had been lots of wine on offer, which admittedly she had consumed quite heavily to calm her nerves.
Now her husband had whisked Pat up to the bedroom and Jennifer had been left handcuffed on the carpet. What&#039;s more she was beginning to wish…</p>

He didn&#039;t care how cute the new paralegal was. He didn&#039;t care how sweetly she had asked him to help find the old files in the basement. He had to go. He had just gotten out of a very boring, three hour board meeting, where he had drank cup after cup of coffee to keep awake during the first hour. The rest of the meeting he spent trying to ignore his full bladder. Finally, the meeting had concluded, and he made a direct beeline towards the bathroom. But, on his way there, the new paralegal, Lisa, approached him and asked his help to find the files on the case she was researching. She was so cute in her short navy blue skirt and little matching high heels.…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Officer Jim Collins has been on traffic patrol for 7 years now and is pretty sure he has seen it all...except what he wants to see. He has heard the other traffic officers discuss seeing it from time to time, and has tried to get details without being &quot;too&quot; interested. His former patrol partner had pulled over a lady just last month for weaving in traffic. She had been about 28, pretty, and very drunk. She had gotten out of her car and flooded her panties while trying to walk a straight line. Jim had seen her at the station, but he could see nothing of her wetness; her dress had remained dry and he didn&#039;t think it would be wise to request a peek. Jim wants to see a genuine wet accident. He wants to pull over a…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Lisa flicked on her turn signal, quickly tucked her left hand back into her crotch and began to decelerate. She whimpered slightly as she swung her car over into the right lane. She had to pee so bad it wasn&#039;t even funny. She was one of that beautiful college girls– great body, lots of fun. She shifted around in her tight shorts, trying to relieve the pressures of her screaming bladder. Her nipples poked out against her hot pink tank top. She was trying to make it home, but finally gave up hope and pulled into the nearest clean gas station she could find. There few things she hated more than peeing in a dank and smelly bathroom. When she finally found a station nice enough for her standards, she was so…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Vickie left her family&#039;s residence and her boyfriend in Philadelphia around 11:00 PM on Sunday. She was in route to Virginia Beach and she traveled down the eastern shore to get there. Traveling that late at night does not afford one a sufficient number of rest stops, and it was a very long drive. Vickie (a city girl) was still reluctant to bare her bottom to relieve herself even if she was to be covered by dense woodlands. As a matter of fact the denser the woods the more reluctant she was.
So, she was determined to make the entire six–hour trip without a bathroom break. She had never driven this far before so she wasn&#039;t quite sure what she was getting into. However, when she set out she was feeling good and…</p>
