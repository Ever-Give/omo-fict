        <p class="card-text">Linda was so excited about her date with Mark tonight. They had not been together in a while and her hot black pussy ached for his hard white meat, and she had a special treat for him tonight. They had both wanted to experience the feel of her gushing her hot pee while he was inside her, but she had been unable to do it so far. Tonight was going to be the night, she was determined to give him the pee–fuck they both wanted. She had started her preparation an hour before she left. A couple of beers while she getting ready, and then several large glasses of water just before she left. She felt a slight urge to pee as she left her house, but is was only a 45 minute drive and she was sure she hold it until she got…</p>

Robin rocketed out of bed just as her alarm clock exploded with sound. Robin swore, checked the time and swore louder. She was late for soccer practice AGAIN and Coach Martin would not be so understanding this time. The game was to start in just 10 minutes and Robin knew that she&#039;d be very late. Tossing on a sports bra, Robin hurried to the bathroom to comb her hair and brush her teeth. She had to pee but figured she could do that in the locker room. Besides, she just didn&#039;t have the time.
Pulling her strawberry–blonde hair back in a quick ponytail, Robin glanced at the clock again. It was 5 minutes to 10, meaning she had just 5 minutes to get to the…</p>

Art Cavanaugh wasn&#039;t really into parties. Well, at least not formal parties. A good picnic while on a fishing trip, or a bit of a celebration after a golf match, these he could take. But as for formal gatherings, cocktail parties, and dress up affairs, they simply weren&#039;t his cup of tea.

It was a Sunday afternoon in the fall. It was cold and rainy and there was nothing interesting to experience. I invited Debby, a friend&#039;o&#039;mine, which was not really my girlfriend, but I liked her for her kinky madness. After cleaning up the room a bit and waiting with a magazine on the couch, she finally arrived.
I opened the door and noticed she&#039;d dressed herself in a very special way. To describe: she wore a white blouse and a tie, a blue blazer, a grey cardigan, a pleated plaid skirt, white socks up &#039;till her knees and blue shoes. She knew she could make me aroused with dressing like that, so then I knew…</p>

She shimmied into the catsuit before adding a pair of latex bootsocks then added a thick rubber belt around her slim waist. All this time she continued drinking a sports drink she knew would go through her quickly.
She then drew on her long boots before pulling on a pair of latex gauntlets and then came the transluscent PVC mac that reached down just over the tops of her boots.

One of the girls in my year, Lisa also used the bus as she lived about a mile further on from me. One afternoon, when the last lesson was Physics, I had been watching Lisa from my place at the table behind hers; she was a very attactive girl with long auburn hair and looked very sexy in her uniform of white blouse and short grey skirt. What caught my attention first was that, to get a better view of a demonstation of something – I can&#039;t remember what – Lisa was kneeling on her chair and leaning forwards with her elbows on the table. This gave me a nice view of her purple knickers, which was…</p>

A lunch time drink with the girls would have to be cut short because her husband needed her to attend a really important dinner at his prospective bosses’ mansion. Not wanting to let the girls down she had agreed to still meet them in town for a couple of hours before going on to meet her husband for the short drive up town. It was almost time for her taxi to arrive. Kathy finished applying her make–up, checked her hair and twisted her diamond earrings into the right position. At last satisfied she stepped over to the loo, lifted her dress clear and emptied her bladder, little knowing that the next time she would do so she may cost her husband the job he so desperately needed.…</p>

I had started working at a wood–based summer camp as a counselor when I was just 14. I had learned to appreciate nature, both its beauty and it&#039;s slight discomfort. The campgrounds were the typical mid–forested summer day camp; park benches and wooden tables, a shed for tools and a field area for play. High trees offered shade from the golden summer sun and soft soil padded our hiking trails. However, the lack of adequate facilities was tremendous.
Filthy water covered the muddy concrete floors of the bathrooms where rusty stalls refused to shut and foul toilets refused to flush. The ancient sinks bore no water, what can I say, the toilets were…</p>

The St. Patrick&#039;s Day Parade is a huge event and thousands of people come out to see it. People are drinking from the early morning and it&#039;s basically a huge party. Due to all of the drinking, there are thousands of people that need to pee. The really good thing for a pee enthusiast is that there are no outdoor porta potties set up, which is really surprising when you think about it. All of the people have to pee in a few restaurants that are open and allow the public to use their bathrooms. If you scout out these restaurants, you can see some great desperation sightings.
