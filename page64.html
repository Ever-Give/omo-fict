        <p class="card-text">This story is laid in the years of World War II, when female soldiers first began to enter the American Army in numbers.

I have always had some interest in desperation situations, but not until this event did I realize how arousing a woman&#039;s badly distended bladder could be to her male companion. In this case it was mine! This was such a personal matter that it took me a long time to muster the courage to relate it. Now that I have recorded it, others may enjoy reading it. While I can recall the event with some enjoyment now, and my interest in desperation is as deep as ever, I do not again want to carry it this far!

Arriving just and hour ago, their coach had told them to use the bathroom before stretching, but Jenny being anxious as she was didn&#039;t need to, or at least not thinking they did. Stretching finished and first call going out for her event, signals from her filing bladder coming in quickly got her attention. Own nervousness adding to the dilemma, coach&#039;s pep talk wasn&#039;t helping at this point. Hoping no one would notice her light bouncing crossed legs, maybe a bathroom tip before the race could be worked in.

Little did Beth know how difficult that was about to become the day they trudged into barracks that cold, damp November morning. Their first sight of sergeant Willis was that very morning as they gathered on the parade ground. He was a fiercesome character, tall, muscular; an imposing figure if ever there was one. Willis loved his job. He loved making soldiers out of raw recruits. He loved being a hard man and in the army the only way was the hard way. It didn’t matter to him one bit that it was women he was in charge of; to him one soldier was just like any other at the end of the day no matter what sex they were.…</p>

Anyway before she knew it she had accepted and she found herself standing to leave with him. Standing reminded her that she could really do with a wee. Her bladder felt uncomfortably full beneath her short skirt but with her boyfriend set to leave plus the fact she didn’t know where the loo’s were and was too afraid to ask, she resigned herself to wait until she got back to his place.

The tube rattled out of Baker Street and headed north. She had always been funny about using public toilets, and how they were usually filthy and disgusting.
