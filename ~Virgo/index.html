        <p class="card-text">This is another little vignette that takes place in ca 1930 at the vast, pastoral estate in England known as Bish Manor.
We begin with Derrick, a tall, thin, respectable no–nonsense type. He was a handsome gentleman, and was avidly involved in the social circles, attended all the parties, and kept himself at all times blithe and charming. After all, one never knew where one&#039;s future fianc&#039;e might be lurking, and marrying well was an object most sought after by his crowd.
He thereby began his day, an outing to Bish Manor, with a bright and innocent temperament. There was nothing more on his mind but than to get nicely sloshed, play a little cricket outdoors with the fellows, have a good cigar and do a spot of…</p>

        <p class="card-text">I&#039;m in the midst of holding it, all alone, and I&#039;m already quite far into the game. I&#039;m dressed entirely in black, my tightest jeans and a small black tee. I would prefer to be wearing more clothes, because when the time comes, there&#039;s just nothing quite as delicious as the feeling of all the hot wetness soaking me, through the fabric, first coming warm and quickly turning cold. But I&#039;m not there yet. I&#039;ve been gulping water and soda constantly for the past three hours. It&#039;s getting bad. My bladder is thrashing around like a dying fish– a big, heavy one.
It&#039;s going to start hurting in earnest any minute now. I know my body quite well, having done this same thing countless times. Already I can feel my urethra…</p>

        <p class="card-text">This is the story of Reginald. A tall, handsome, huskily built but elegant gentleman aged about 40. His little episode took place one evening at Bish Manor, England, ca. 1935.
He had been with a wedding party all day, most of which took place out of doors at a vast estate in the English countryside. Once evening came, the party moved to an enormous house, practically labyrinthine, five stories or more, the rooms and passageways innumerable, and as Reginald was soon to discover, nearly impossible to navigate if unfamiliar.
He had been out of doors and in the company of others for the entire day, (as this particular wedding party was very large, over two hundred people, most of them high aristocracy, and…</p>
