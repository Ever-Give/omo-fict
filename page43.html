        <p class="card-text">So let&#039;s continue our adventure at the football game. We had a good time while at the game. You can&#039;t buy beer at the college games, of course, so we quenched our thirst with cokes and water.
During halftime we all took a trip to the bathroom. While on our way Kendra grabbed my arm and whispered in my ear, &quot;Mikey... how good was that earlier? I know I didn&#039;t wet myself like I promised but it felt so good trying to hold it. I just couldn&#039;t wet myself in front of all those people. Sorry, I hope you aren&#039;t disappointed...&quot;
&quot;Hey Kendra, that was pretty hot that all three of you had to go, especially Stacia. I really thought she wouldn&#039;t make it,&quot; I replied.
&quot;I know, I thought so too. It was a pretty close call…</p>

Lucy–Anne was a Filipino nurse, tiny, like so many Asian girls. She told me she was 27 but at a casual glance she could easily have passed for 16 or 17. On the outing she had been wearing dark blue stretch denim jeans that fitted her slim body really well.
&quot;This was the first outing I had been on, since I had only joined St Luke&#039;s 3 months ago. In the evening I tried cider for the first time, and I really enjoyed it, and drank quite a lot. I left the bar as soon as Sister said it was time to go, as I was starting to feel dizzy. I was on the coach for ages before we started. Sister was having some argument with the driver and trying to get all the nurses out of the bar. I do not remember us starting…</p>

It was her last summer before college, too short to get a job and she wanted to relax as much as possible anyway. With her younger brother and sister away at camp and her two older siblings off traveling, there was usually no one in the house to wake her anyway.
No one except the ringing phone, anyway. Melissa rolled absentmindedly out of bed and stumbled across her room to answer it. &quot;Hello?&quot; she heard herself say groggily.
&quot;Hi, honey. You&#039;re not just getting out of bed, are you?&quot;
Melissa snapped wide–awake at her mother&#039;s voice. &quot;No, Mom,&quot; she lied. &quot;I just got back from jogging.&quot; She did her best not to chuckle…</p>

He says I shouldn&#039;t because our ages are so different. All I can do is tell you what went on last time we met and hope that someone can offer a solution.
Robert has a boat and spends his life floating around the canals of England. Last weekend he asked me to meet him near Burton–on–Trent at 6 on Friday evening. After work I had a really good drink and caught the train. By 6 I had been on the way for 2 hours and it was another half hour walk to his boat.

What with drinking tea and coffee as well as alcohol we often start off in a dehydrated condition so we play &#039;hold it&#039; to start with. If we meet in a public place its off to the pub and take in a pint or two of shandy followed by fresh orange. The task is then to reach the boat without losing any.
After eating, the next round is usually messy involving May finding interesting and unexpected ways to force me to put my clothing in the washing basket. Anticipating when she will do this has become one of my major tasks since she is cunning. Once she held until after the meal then…</p>

Robert&#039;s boat has been out of action for a while so we had our wet weekend at his house and you&#039;d be surprised how close it is to yours.
As usual I arrived at the station full to overflowing. Now I&#039;m not very good at geography and when Robert said to take the train to Dewsbury I thought it must be the station nearest to his house so it was a bit of a surprise when he said we had to go another half an hour by car.
He had borrowed a neighbor&#039;s car and so we had to keep it dry. I&#039;m all right in a train but the jiggling of a car plays havoc with my lower parts. I shuffled about…</p>

Trying to remain asleep was difficult when the noon sun shone harshly through her window, creating a beam formed by the dust in the air that glared directly into her eyes. It also didn&#039;t help that she had to pee so bad, but at the moment she was still too lazy to get up. It didn&#039;t take long before she couldn&#039;t stand it anymore, and she slowly, reluctantly, threw herself out of her sheets and clumsily stood on the soft rug. Orientating herself, she grew more aware of her urge.
&quot;Man, I gotta pee...&quot; she mumbled to herself as she stepped into a pair of pink fuzzy slippers.

She lived with her 3 older brothers who were very highly sexed and loved seeing girls bursting for a pee. They also lived with her parents who knew nothing of their sons&#039; peculiar pastime and were very prim and proper. They would think that the sight of an 18 year old wetting her pants was an absolute disgrace, and could not even imagine that anyone could &#039;get off&#039; on such a thing.
Well one Friday evening the brothers decided that it would be amazing to contrive a plan, working together to make Chloe absolutely desperate for a pee, and then ultimately wee in her knickers in public.

Some of the nurses at our local hospital recently held a coach outing to the coast, which was a journey of about two and a half hours. A good friend of mine was on the outing, and knowing my interest in the subject, she told me about the emergency stop on the way back. Even though nurses are reputed to have exceptionally big bladders, a number of them needed the loo desperately as they had been in a pub for some time before leaving. In fact her words were &quot;I have never seen so many desperate women trying to get into a small public loo, and from the time it took for us all to go, I doubt if any coach has ever held so much pee.&quot;

Loraine was the nursing sister who had organized the outing. In her late thirties, average height with a trim, rounded figure with short blonde hair she was the image of efficiency you would expect for a senior nurse. On the outing she had been wearing a rather short, tight–fitting fawn skirt.
&quot;Everything went really well all day until the last hour, when it was difficult to get some of the nurses out of the pub, and we were late leaving. The driver started complaining about having to work late, an attitude which annoyed me, so I rather abruptly told him that if he turned up in St Luke&#039;s A &amp; E needing treatment, he would expect us to work overtime if needed, so he could do the same for…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Here is the other half of the Tea in Bed weekend as I persuaded May to write it. There are fewer characters because she sticks closer to the facts, Robert.
I wish Robert had let me type this because I&#039;d have done it better.
To explain about me first: I was always the fat girl at school, the one nobody wanted on their team. I grew up on a new housing estate in a town in Cheshire and I really only had one friend, that was Rachel who was tall&amp; thin. The girls said &quot;Here comes 10&quot; because she looked like a 1 and I was short and round. She used to come by my house almost every day till we were 16 then she left school and got a job. I stayed on and was very lonely.
After A levels I found a job as the office…</p>

        <p class="card-text">My friend, Jade and I were off headed to an overnight party with some other friends but first, we went to a pub to drink since it was a hot day. We each had a full pitcher of beer and drank all of it. We ate a little and then we headed towards the bathroom because of recent problem that I had experienced. Jade said she did not need to go so I went by myself, peed quickly into the toilet and then left before even letting all of it out because we were in a hurry to get to the party, which was about an hour away There were BOYZ at the party. I got thirsty again and drank 4 more bottles of beer getting drunk. I knew that I was out of control but I finally sat down with a little help from Jade. She had also gotten…</p>

        <p class="card-text">&quot;I&#039;m coming, I&#039;m coming,&quot; I yelled, setting down the cup after a final gulp and collecting my things on the way out after I heard Margo honking the car horn in the driveway.
Usually, I am up, dressed; having my second cup of coffee and waiting on Margo by the time she arrives. However, the electricity went off sometime during the night and though my internal alarm went off early enough for me to take a quick shower, there wasn&#039;t enough time to fully enjoy a cup of coffee, much less a second cup. Maybe I could persuade Margo to stop somewhere before getting on the freeway.
Hurriedly, tip–toeing in stocking feet across cold concrete with heels in hand, I glanced up to realize someone else was in the car with…</p>
