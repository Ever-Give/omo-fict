        <p class="card-text">A few years ago when I was living in London I traveled on the underground regularly (that&#039;s usually called &#039;the Tube&#039; in London, or the Subway or Metro for people outside the UK), and would often see girls who were obviously desperate for a pee.
Because there are no toilets on the Underground trains, and none on most of the stations, on many occasions I was lucky enough to witness girls getting so desperate that it resulted in a &#039;wetting&#039;, or a &#039;public peeing&#039; where the girl would just finally give up and squat down for a pee. However, this is the only &#039;Business Suit&#039; wetting that I can remember.
On this particular day I was traveling during the middle of the day and the trains were not very crowded, so…</p>

Jae and Penny hurried uncomfortably through the Maxiversity hallway to the next exam session. One hellish semester, six humiliating months, behind them, and still no sign of the promised revolution. Even Lisa, the eternal optimist of the Bird Women, and Caryn, the most muscular and intimidating of the oppressed group, were losing their hope. Doing her best to ignore the intense summons emanating from between her long legs, Jae shuddered to think what she and her friends would do without Lisa and Caryn to give them hope.
&quot;D&#039;you think this bunch will be as rude as the boys from last week?&quot; Jae asked Penny between short breaths.
&quot;Hope not,&quot; the shorter girl answered. &quot;You&#039;d…</p>

The wait paid off, for when Katie rounded the corner towards the history library a few moments past 8:00, Penny was sitting at a table there, pretending to read an old Time magazine. &quot;Hi!&quot; Katie said cheerfully as she sat down. For once, the cheerfulness wasn&#039;t made up; Katie was delighted to have this slender reed of hope to cling to.
Penny was happy – for the first time since the Deluge – as well. &quot;Hey! I was just reading about Watergate here. It&#039;s amazing how far back the magazines go.&quot; As she closed the magazine, she couldn&#039;t help allowing a nervous glance at the Swineherd standing guard by the library door, not even fifteen feet away. They&#039;d found each other, but…</p>

Fiona arrived at my house at 7am for the 100–mile drive to Bristol for the shopping expedition that we had planned. I had known Fiona for about 20 years as the fairly attractive, but quiet daughter of my fathers&#039; friends, but up until recently we had not really been friends, only acquaintances, which had changed after meeting by chance in the pub three months ago.
We drove up the motorway in good spirits, looking forward to the day&#039;s shopping ahead. I was already starting to feel a little pressure on my bladder following the three cups on coffee I had drunk before…</p>

On Sunday evening we got out the camcorder to remind ourselves of some of the places we went. There was a short clip that neither of us could place. It showed me hiding behind a tree and then running across a meadow followed by some unstable shots of the sky. It went blank then showed two minutes of a close–up of some grass with a spider climbing over the plants.
Eventually we managed to place it. Early on in our friendship we had taken sandwiches and a flask intending to spend the day…</p>

Joan&#039;s taste didn&#039;t run to anything flashy – just an oversize tee shirt and a pair of shorts, but a good sports bra was essential. The sports store had a good selection. Joan was admiring some bras in a pleasing shade of blue Lycra when an enthusiastic sales assistant came bouncing up to her.

Maybe that was all there was to it, she thought to herself as she lay on her bed, idly fondling the crotch of her jeans. Linda looked at her watch and frowned. Her girlfriends were supposed to call her when they were ready to meet. If they didn&#039;t come soon, they were going to miss the movie.

        <p class="card-text">I now present a story of male desperation. While I am strictly heterosexual, I have often been interested in male desperation– mostly concerning men who are middle aged to older, grey haired and distinguished. This is based on a true story that was told to me by a relative who knew this man. She described him as resembling the actor George Kennedy.
&quot;Damn I gotta go,&quot; George thought to himself as he gritted his teeth and squirmed in his seat. He had been sitting in a massive traffic jam on the Palisades Parkway as he was driving in to work. The drive into New York usually took 1/2 hour but he had now been sitting in traffic for well over an hour and the coffee and juice with breakfast was now catching up to…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Last week I had to go to a Handy shop in a big shopping mall. My drill didn&#039;t work and i had called the shop owner if it is possible to get a new. When I arrived at the shop, it was terribly busy, so I decided to go for a little shopping tour and come back later. It was a very hot day so I went into a cafe and bought an ice cream and a coke and sat out on the balcony. Afterwards, I went into some clothing shops and bought a nice short top. Before I returned to the Handy shop I bought another bottle of coke and then I slowly walked back.
When I entered the shop, only two guys were inside looking at the shop windows. Behind the counter I saw a big very well built guy with dark brown hair and wonderful blue eyes…</p>

Episode 5 – Wet by Dawn
Laurie&#039;s jeep stopped with screeching tires in front of the fraternity house where the big party was being held. She and Cathy had been able to hear the music from down the road, but they weren&#039;t there to party. Cathy jumped out of the jeep immediately as it came to a halt and crossed her legs with both hands grabbing at her crotch.
&quot;I don&#039;t care what you say,&quot; she snapped at Laurie, &quot;the first thing that I am going to do, is go to the bathroom!&quot;
&quot;That&#039;s where we have to go,&quot; Laurie replied as she got out too and walked toward the entrance with her thighs clamped tightly together all the time.
&quot;You&#039;re not kidding!&quot; Cathy followed her without…</p>
