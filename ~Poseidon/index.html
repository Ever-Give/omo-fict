        <p class="card-text">Some weeks ago work took me to a meeting in London from which I had to go on to a day conference in Brighton. As per company policy travel was by rail, normally a reasonably pleasant affair as the main line trains although crowded are quite comfortable. I had expected to return from Brighton via London, the reverse of my outward journey but found that the cheapskates in the office had booked me on the slow, all stations coastal route back to Fareham. I had never used this service so had no idea what awaited me. If I had I may have arranged things differently.The conference did not finish till late in the afternoon and I had to dash for the station to get my booked train, not even having time to use the loo…</p>

        <p class="card-text">It all began last summer, after a nightmare journey home from work one Friday evening. I had left work in a rush, not bothering to use the loo, although I needed to, as my journey is usually less than 30 minutes. But not tonight! A lorry fire on the motorway caused a huge traffic jam and my short journey took well over two hours. Not having peed earlier I found myself becoming increasingly desperate as time went on. How I held it I still don&#039;t know as several times I thought I was going to wet myself in the car but somehow managed to hold it; but by the time I reached home I was in agony. As I hobbled from the car to my front door I was almost doubled up with pain but somehow made it indoors and upstairs to…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Bladder problems! Not something that I&#039;d ever experienced and something to joke about with friends – who do sometimes admit to embarrassing leaks when laughing or coughing or in a couple of cases not quite making it home from the pub in time! I always found these confessions rather amusing as I did the Tena adverts on TV – I could not believe that all these people wet themselves or needed &#039;protection&#039; to keep their knickers dry. That someone might enjoy wetting their pants or even their bed was unbelievable. But then it happened – totally unexpected, very embarrassing (at the time) but ultimately amazing.Perhaps some background is in order. I&#039;m Rachel, and no spring chicken being in my late 40&#039;s though I&#039;ve…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Part 1 Something very strange happened to me a couple of months back that I&#039;m still trying to make sense of. It&#039;s said that sexual response changes as we age so maybe that&#039;s it &#039; all I know is that I&#039;m still trying to work it out. Here&#039;s what happened. I had met up with an old friend for a Friday evening drink after work &#039; well she was drinking wine, I was driving so was on fizzy water but still had several glasses. Despite the water I didn&#039;t feel any need to pee before we left and nor did Jane so neither of us visited the ladies. The drive to Jane&#039;s house and then home normally takes about half an hour so I had no real concerns about being caught short. As she was getting into the car Jane muttered that she…</p>

        <p class="card-text">This happened several years ago now when I was going out with lad who was a real football fanatic. Fortunately I enjoy the game as well, especially as most Saturday afternoons found us in the stands at our local ground. Nothing exciting – only second division, and not just the team. The facilities at the ground were limited and basic with few toilets for either sex. Those that were provided were scruffy, dirty and best avoided unless absolutely desperate.Of course, having had a jar or two in the pub before the match, sitting or standing in the cold were a simple recipe for desperation. Many times I found that I had to push through the crowd at half–time and again before we left, often queuing for a while in…</p>

One fine Saturday I relaxed on a plastic sun lounger on our very secluded patio with a rather raunchy book. It was hot, and to slake my thirst I had been drinking large quantities of mineral water. The sexy goings on in the book made me quite randy and I frequently rubbed myself between my legs, knowing that I would make myself come eventually but enjoying the long slow build–up.After a while I realised that my bladder was filling but was simply too comfortable, and too lazy, to get up and use the toilet. Before long I was getting quite desperate, rubbing and holding myself to avoid an…</p>

Saving it, she clicked on print and leaned back in her chair.As she relaxed her concentration she noticed something else – she was bursting for a wee. Thinking back she realised she hadn&#039;t been to the loo since lunch time and, while concentrating so hard on the report had managed to suppress the increasing pain in her bladder.

Note: This story contains Female Desperation &amp; Wetting, and Masturbation. I first discovered the pleasurable aspects of wetting my knickers while at university. It all began when I became friendly with a group of girls in the folk music club and began to frequent the various pubs in the area. For some reason cider was our preferred drink, being cheap and strong – despite its well known diuretic properties.When I first joined the group I was amused by the frequent references to ending up with &quot;cider legs&quot; if one of us drank too much. I assumed this to mean drunk, but was to find out otherwise, though our frequent visits to the ladies loo and the fact that I knew that…</p>

In most cases they wet themselves laughing, probably the main cause of accidents for teenage girls.

I have really been under pressure to complete a major project to get some complex documentation complete and the whole thing has been dogged by problems. As a result I have had sleepless nights and have felt really stressed out, the eventual result of which proved rather embarassing.
