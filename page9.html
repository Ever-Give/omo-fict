We hope you enjoy our contributions, if not for the writing, then just for knowing that what we write is true. Hopefully others will find wetting with a partner is not an empty dream, but with the right encouragement, something intimate and enjoyable for genuinely sharing.
I have a very special relationship with my partner Val, which works very much for both of us. She modelled very successfully for a while, making very good money. She now works in the fashion industry and we have just started our own business. Although she is not turned on by wetting directly, she is happy to play my games and I hers. She will wet…</p>

Ann and Linda sat in Linda&#039;s room. They were talking about the week before when they had helped a girl overcome the taboo of peeing herself when she had to go so bad she was in extreme agony. They were also talking about the mother peeing herself to show the girl it was all right to pee herself. When they were all pissed the mother allowed the girl to pee herself when she wanted if it was possible to do it undetected and said she would be doing it as well. &quot;We need to find a way to make our mothers pee themselves with us. Perhaps they will like it too and allow us to do it when we want to so we don&#039;t have to hide our wet…</p>

        <p class="card-text">I am writing about my experiences with a very special woman that I felt very fortunate to meet even if it was for a limited time. It all started with my new job at an advisory and management accounting firm in Los Angeles. I had just graduated from university at the age of 23 and was a little inexperienced in the relationship department. I had never had a girlfriend or even a high school sweetheart. All my sexual experiences had come from binge–drinking campus parties and one–night stands. Admittedly, I was glad to get out of the college life and into the real world, where was I hoping to find a more meaningful relationship that I had not found up to this point.
I had graduated with good grades from a…</p>

Julia and Jessica had been friends since childhood. They had grown up together and were now 20 years old. They had always talked openly together about almost everything, including sexual urges and behaviour. Occasionally they indulged in wetting themselves together, for they both enjoyed feeling their bladders filling up to their capacity and sometimes they went that one bit too far. One Saturday the two were shopping in town. They had drunk several large cokes during the morning and were seated in the…</p>

        <p class="card-text">It had started out as a sort of confession. I didn&#039;t know how Sarah would react, but I had really wanted to talk to Sarah about it, mainly because we always told each other our secrets. We had confided in each other since we first became friends over ten years ago. We knew most things if not everything about each other. So I didn&#039;t have too much of a problem telling her. I&#039;d had a little accident in my jeans on the way home from the station a few weeks earlier, and I had realised that wetting my knickers had really turned me on. My mum had been very understanding when I got home, and had confessed that she had wet her pants several times too over the years. I just hadn&#039;t quite expected this reaction from Sarah…</p>

        <p class="card-text">It was a very hot day when Sally went back from her basketball game. The temperature was way above 30 degrees Celsius and she was wearing a tank top and light blue jeans. She was regretting now, that she hadn&#039;t put on a skirt instead of the jeans, but the morning had been a lot cooler.
The game had gone well – her team won by ten points. But it was very exhausting, too, in this weather. She drank at least two big bottles of water during the game and still felt thirsty after it – so she went for a beer to the restaurant nearby to celebrate their victory with her teammates. 
They had a great time! They kept buying rounds, and by the end of their stay, Sally had gulped down two beers, a soda and a coffee – so…</p>

Our day in the park ended up as a wet one not only for Jenny, but also for her new friend Allison, as well for me. I certainly didn&#039;t plan it that way, although I enjoyed the results. And no, we&#039;re not talking about rain here. Actually, Jenny had a bladder control problem that, while sometimes embarrassing for her, brought much delight to me. To be fair, I must note that some of her problem, maybe most of it, was of her own making. She consumed what I considered excessive amounts of bottled water and, when tired and needing energy, far too much cola. I had discovered this more than a year earlier, on our second date. We had…</p>

The bus arrived and Ann and Linda got on. When they were sitting Ann looked around. They were sitting at the back of the bus and no one was near them. Ann leaned over to Linda. &quot;I do it here IF you promise to pee through your panties on the toilet in the mall.&quot; Linda thought about it for a few seconds. She was wearing black jeans so it wouldn&#039;t show a wet spot if she pulled her pants up to her wet panties. &quot;Deal, but I only promise to try, I don&#039;t know if I can do it!&quot;

First thing was an accident that happened to my girlfriend few years ago. I saw it and after that occasion I have been interested and also little excited about this subject. I really enjoy if that happens to other young women, but after that one accident I have not seen that kind of wetting event. Close situations many times (club lines and taxi lines in the night for example), but not really wetting accidents. I never thought I could accidentally pee my pants myself.

Tonight was the night. All week I had carefully monitored my fluid intake preparing for this special night. My girlfriend and I were going out to a party with some close friends and I was driving. Normally this would have been the short straw, but, my mock annoyance covered my anticipation and delight well. In the four hours we were there, I helped her drink down at least three pints of various liquids while sipping slowly at a simple glass of water. I couldn&#039;t believe my luck as we walked back to our car, as she still hadn&#039;t gone to pee and by now must have a bladder that bulged more than my erect cock. Luckily Jess did…</p>

Pauline and I had been friends since early childhood. We&#039;d grown up together, played together, gone to school together, and done lots of things together. We knew each other pretty well, or so I thought. We both loved cycling and often went for long bike rides in the country, and it was on a summer&#039;s day that we were out cycling together, and had stopped for a drink and a break. Pauline also likes painting. Scenes, portraits, that sort of thing and she&#039;s really good at it. She asked me if I would pose for her, as she wanted to paint me. I&#039;d done so before so I said, &quot;sure, of course I will.&quot;
&quot;Great, &quot; said Pauline, &quot;We&#039;ll talk…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Jeanine was a girl I went to school with back in high school. She, to me, was beautiful, about 5 foot 7, maybe 140 pounds, short black hair, brown skin, a body not too thick but not too thin. What caught me about her was for someone who tried too hard to act too good for me, she really made a lot of bad choices in men back then. 
It was a little into February when she told the class a story about how when she was younger she would hold it as long as she could, run up to the top stair of her apartment building, then cross her legs and pee her pants. I couldn&#039;t tell by the way she told the story whether she liked it or not, but just thinking of her deliberately peeing into her panties and shorts made me want to…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Most people thought of them as the most despicable/disgusting/unpopular girls in the school, but some thought of them as heroes – not to mention a real turn–on.
The pee gang was a group of three senior girls – Rachel, Melissa, and Randy. They were famous for the wetting stunts they frequently pulled. Probably their favourite trick was to use a two code–word system. Most people had no idea how they did it, but then again most people didn&#039;t try to be around every time the pee gang put on one of their shows. They&#039;d stage a casual conversation, use one code–word to indicate when they were ready, which would then be repeated by all the other members of the group to indicate that they, too, were ready, and another…</p>

Margaret, Maisie and Mandy were sisters. Margaret was the oldest aged 22, Maisie was 20, and Mandy was 19.
About 5 years ago, while she was in school, Maisie had taken part in a French Exchange visit, where she went to stay with a family near Lyons for two weeks, and then the daughter of the French family, Juliette, came to stay with them for two weeks. They had kept in touch, and Juliette, who was the same age as Maisie, was spending a fortnight&#039;s break with Maisie and her sisters. Of course, there…</p>
