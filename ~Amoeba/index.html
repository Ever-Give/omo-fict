        <p class="card-text">Kelli stood outside her sister&#039;s doorway, piss still dripping from the panties her older sister was recently wearing, her red hair laying down over her shoulders and green eyes almost shimmering. Kelli giggled slightly.
Allie stood in her room; blushing so hard you could see it through her brown hair that cluttered her face. Kelli walked away, making sure the dark blue panties were a little bit up her ass for her sister to see, as she walked into her room. Allie stood there, knowing that Kelli had something planned from the glimmer in her eye. She cautiously walked over to her sister&#039;s door, which was open, but was dark inside. She stood there, looking in the room for Kelli, but couldn&#039;t find her. She…</p>

        <p class="card-text">It was a cool autumn day when 25 year old Melissa stood on her friend&#039;s doorstep, her long black hair blowing across her sexy eyes in the brisk breeze. Mel is the type of girl that has &quot;the eyes.&quot; &quot;The eyes&quot; are the type of eyes that can give a super sexy look and get anyone to do anything. She fidgeted with her panties for a moment as they were riding into her crotch cause she liked to wear tight satin panties. These ones were blue with flower prints on them under her baby pink mini skirt. She made sure her tits looked nice and perky in her matching pink halter–top and knocked on the door. After she knocked on the door she realized pulling her panties out of her pussy made her horny and she shifted her legs.…</p>

&quot;Yeah it is,&quot; her friend Mandy replied. Summer&#039;s brain stopped for a second before she realized that she was thinking out loud.
&quot;So what are we going to do?&quot; Summer asked, her long blonde hair falling almost seductively over her face, sweat dripping from her shoulders down under her tank top, making her 36 Cs glisten under the hot sun. The only thing on her that wasn&#039;t sweaty was her toned, tan legs, which looked especially sexy in her short pink &amp; white striped satin basketball shorts. For being 25 she definitely looked like she could still be in high school and yet would get any guy&#039;s testosterone…</p>

One day, 19–year–old Allie was sitting home alone in the summer time, just hanging out in her short denim skirt and pink camisole (and if you were looking up her skirt you would see her dark blue cotton bikini panties.) She sat there on the couch bored, watching TV and sipping at her Coke. She was quite a naughty and promiscuous girl, and got anyone she wanted when she wanted them...it wasn&#039;t too hard for her; all she had to do was throw her long, brunette hair over her shoulder and smile her shiny lips at somebody, show off her perfect white teeth with the glitter in her brown eyes and she had them.
She was…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Oh no, I woke up too late!
Glanced at the clock, quarter past eight
I hurried into my pink panties and short skirt
Covered up my C cup titties with a tight shirt
Grabbed a quick bite and drink
Already need to pee, but no time to I think
I rush quickly out the door
Already getting desperate for sure
I made it to the bus stop just in time
Got another soda, this one lemon &amp; lime
I let my blonde hair fall down
So beautiful all the other girls cried and frowned
I felt my bladder start to fill up
Hoping I could make it to my bus stop
So thirsty I had to drink another one
Crossing my legs now, this should be fun
Wriggling my legs while sitting on the bus
Hoping to not wet myself and make a fuss
I…</p>

Lisa looked up at Christy confused and Christy smirked at her, saying, &quot;If you&#039;re going to be wetting your pants like a baby, then we need to treat you like one! I want you to go to the store and buy some diapers and a pacifier. Also buy a pair of handcuffs.&quot;
Lisa threw her arms in the air and looked down at her soaking wet jeans. Christy smiled and said, &quot;You&#039;re going just like you are now.&quot; She looked up at the clock. &quot;Hurry, baby, I&#039;m timing you.&quot; Christy lay on the couch and turned on the television.

She&#039;s very pretty, long tanned legs, tight ass, 36C cup, and sexy brunette hair to match her cute brown eyes. She&#039;s also very bisexual; she may even prefer girls to guys. And for the past few months she&#039;s been toying over the Internet, getting interested in the idea of being dominant and having a submissive girl. And today was the day she was going to meet the girl she had been talking with for those few months. From the pictures she saw, Christy is a feisty redhead girl with shoulder length curly hair who is athletic and has perky tits.
Lisa stretched and enjoyed the sun sparkling over her nude body…</p>

She sat there, letting the warm sun soak her through the windows, glistening on her tight, tan body. She ran her hand over her rock hard abs and smiled as she looked down at herself. She loved her body and she loved the attention it got. She didn&#039;t have a boyfriend but she loved fucking a different guy every night. She knew she was a total slut and didn&#039;t care. She sat there thinking how it was Thursday, wishing it were Friday so she could go clubbing. It wasn&#039;t worth going on Thursday nights, though; the clubs weren&#039;t even half packed.
Finally, she got off the bed and walked to the window in her light green…</p>

Going through her dresser, she pulled out a cute black thong with a pink smiley face that winked and said &quot;Don&#039;t You Wish&quot; across it.

        <p class="card-text">He couldn&#039;t believe it. It was Halloween night and there he stood in a stupid devil costume with the horns and plastic trident. He looked at himself in the mirror and thought how ridiculous it must look for a 20 year old guy to be trick or treating, but his girlfriend, Melody, loved to do it every year, even though she&#039;s 21. And just as she was thinking about her, there she walked in, wearing her very appealing fairy outfit: shiny blue skirt with purple spandex on underneath (after all, it is cold outside!) and a white spaghetti strap top barely holding in her beautiful 34 Cs covered with a small, yet warm pink jacket in which her lovely blonde hair fell down to her breasts even though it was held back by a…</p>

        <p class="card-text">20–year–old Shelly never could stand the sound of running water ever since she was a little girl. Even when she goes to the gas station she has to hold her crotch like a little girl because the faint sound of the gasoline running through the pump sends almost uncontrollable impulses to pee right through her. Even when she just gets done peeing, if she flushes the toilet she needs to go again; she also has to cross her beautiful legs very tightly to wash her hands.
And speaking of her beautiful legs, they look ever so sexy today. Nice and tan...you can look at them until her short baby blue fuzzy shorts don&#039;t allow you to look any more (and those shorts don&#039;t hide too much.) The shorts definitely showed off…</p>

        <p class="card-text">School was going by so slow. Well, that&#039;s what 18–year–old Nicole thought anyways, sitting in her high school chemistry class. Nicole was a dream girl...shoulder length brunette hair that she always had in some sexy position and never wore the wrong way. Always wearing her short skirts with her stockings and high heels...and of course, today, she was wearing one as well. A short pink skirt that definitely wasn&#039;t school dress code length, but she managed to keep her fingertips above it and black stockings that ran right up to under the end of her skirt with her black high heels that just went past her ankle. And her cute little top that was way too tight and showed off her 32 C breasts nicely. All the guys…</p>

        <p class="card-text">20–year–old Tiffany was late for class again. She knew that her professor was going to be very upset with her for being late again and would probably fail her on the lab that she was late for. She brushed her brunette hair that fell to her shoulders, wishing that she had a roommate to wake her up. She hated living by herself. Looking in the mirror she noticed she was standing there in nothing but a white pair of bikini panties and a white bra. She quickly slipped on a pink skirt with a matching belt and pulled on thigh high tan stockings. She threw on a white halter–top, slipped on shoes, gulped down a cup of coffee, and ran out the door. She started running to class when she realized that she had forgotten…</p>

When she woke up, her long brunette hair was all in clumps, and when she went to get out of bed her pajamas caught on the bed post and ripped right at the crotch. She wanted to cry, but figured she could just sew it later. As she walked into the bathroom, she noticed all her dirty clothes lying on the floor and knew that she had to go do laundry today. She quickly stepped in the shower and washed her hair, but it was still hard to brush when she came out.
She wrapped a towel around her tight body and walked to her dresser, where she found she had no clean clothes. She looked at the dirty laundry pile realizing how bad the day was going. She picked…</p>
