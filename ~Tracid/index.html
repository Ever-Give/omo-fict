        <p class="card-text">A few weeks ago, my class went to a factory for germs and such things in Vienna. We went there by bus, and the ride took about 3 hours. In the bus, I was sitting next to Anna, and with about 30 minutes left in the ride, I was beginning to catch first signs of growing desperation. First she was just sitting cross–legged, but soon she started to move them against each other and banging her knees. After a while, she started to look very distressed and I asked her if she was OK. She said: &quot;Yeah, I just have to go to the toilet real bad. I hope we get there soon.&quot; This really got my attention. She continued to wiggle her legs around, and it seemed that her need was growing, as when we where nearly there, she…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Last week our class went on a field trip. It was some place out in the deep woods, so there was no chance to go to a loo for quite some time. We started around 9 o&#039;clock, and were supposed to finish at 12. I was together with 3 other girls and 6 boys, and we all had brought plenty of juice to drink. So, at about 10.30, Amila was the first to show the first signs of growing desperation. She was shifting her legs constantly, and was getting more and more nervous. After another 30 minutes, she was showing visible signs of growing discomfort. She could hardly stand still, and when she thought nobody was looking, she quickly put her hand in her crotch for a second. In short notice, Marlene was starting to get…</p>
