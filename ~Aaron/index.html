        <p class="card-text">Sophie&#039;s Indiscretion
Sophie&#039;s bladder throbbed insistently. She ignored it and took another pull on her glass of Chablis. Sophie had other, more pressing matters on her mind, such as her hard earned career crashing to the ground. All her efforts destroyed in an instant, and all because of one damn picture. The image flashed back into her mind again as she squirmed slightly in her chair. All those frills, all that lace, and those two shiny stilettos with that huge ... Sophie again tilted the glass, but the image in her head could not be banished.
Sophie Cl&#039;risseau had flown to England four years ago to study English and Business Studies at South Bank University. With finances running low, Sophie had…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Lucy hobbled hurriedly up to the ladies loo with her hand clasped firmly between her legs. &quot;Please Miss Susan,&quot; she pleaded. &quot;I really need to go to the little girls&#039; room.&quot; Susan was in the middle of smoothing a &quot;Toilet Closed&quot; sign onto the toilet door. She had made this, her third desperation party, a fancy dress school disco themed party and it was so good to see everyone really getting into the spirit of it. Lucy was wearing a short blue pleated skirt, which was now bunched firmly between her legs, and her blonde pigtails and pained expression really completed the effect.
&quot;Is it urgent?&quot; asked Susan.
&quot;Yes miss, ooh it&#039;s an emergency!&quot;
&quot;Well you should have gone during break then, you know that the…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Jennifer struggled against her bonds, but there was no escape. Sweating slightly from her excursions she lay there, panting and stared up from her living room floor. She was bored of doing dishes every day and had wanted more excitement in her life, so her husband suggested joining the local swingers club. She was intrigued, but she hadn&#039;t quite expected this. The meal had gone down great. She had cooked a grand feast for George her husband, and Tom and his wife Pat. There had been lots of wine on offer, which admittedly she had consumed quite heavily to calm her nerves.
Now her husband had whisked Pat up to the bedroom and Jennifer had been left handcuffed on the carpet. What&#039;s more she was beginning to wish…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Saturday night and Lemonade was packed from wall to wall with gorgeous girls. Stella looked around her in wonder. Her London friends had been right; Lemonade was definitely Manchester&#039;s hottest lesbian nightclub. Quality tunes pulsed from the decks and quality girls filled every corner. Serious female talent stretched from the strobing dance floor to the secluded alcoves where several sets of faces were already pressed together.
A girl, that was what Stella needed now. There was definitely enough to choose from. Some possibilities had already caught her gaze– maybe the strawberry blonde at the bar, or the little Chinese girl. Yes, the little Chinese girl in the even smaller tight white dress had definitely…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Hannah&#039;s pee dribbled delicately through her white cotton knickers. Head tilted back, eyes tight shut; she worked her fingers in slow orgasmic circles as she gently peed. The wetness, the excitement, and then the lounge door swung open and Hannah let out a great gush into her knickers in surprise.
&quot;Kirsty you startled me,&quot; she complained to her grinning flat mate. Kirsty always liked to see her friend pleasure herself in front of some dirty watersports video.
&quot;What is it? Another pee movie?&quot; asked Kirsty. She peered at the screen and started to feel a bit concerned at Hannah&#039;s surprise choice of sexual stimulation.
&quot;Oh the video must have finished,&quot; exclaimed Hannah suddenly realizing that the television…</p>

A gorgeous brunette, her exotic tanned features contorted by a longing desperation that served only to enhance her natural beauty. Robbo felt his penis harden inside his jeans. There was nothing she could do now. A slight sigh and a faint look of shocked realization started to form on her face. Then the first trickle as her long held urine started to seep down the inside of her stocking clad legs from under her pristine white dress. There was no avoiding it now. She was wetting herself!
Robbo was rudely startled out of his daydream by the shrill ring of the telephone. He turned and glared angrily at it, shifting…</p>
