Carlee really enjoys her new job as a meter reader for the public works department. She had always been an outdoors type, but not like the earthy women one usually associates with this stereotype. Carlee was 23–years–old, fresh out of university and working towards a career in municipal government. She thought that starting out with a first job as a meter reader would enable her to get real–world experience in local government as well as helping her keep fit. At the same time, she also thought that this job would allow her to indulge in her fetish of desperation and panty wetting, without anyone knowing.
Carlee is about 5&#039;6&quot; tall, with medium–length auburn hair and a great smile. Her…</p>

The doorbell rang and I knew it was the UPS delivery I had been expecting. I opened the door and was greeted by a rather pleasant looking female delivery driver.

She straightened up and still seemed a bit fidgety, as she held out her electronic clipboard for my signature.
