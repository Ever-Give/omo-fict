            Welcome to the archive of stories from <b>Shara and Ger's Pee Desperation Website</b>!<br/>
            Original website was available for 13 or more years and died in 2017.
            While serving as an image repository for omorashi/wetting fans around the world,
            Shara and Ger's website also had a collection of ~900 stories.
            Many people, including us, loved them and were very upset about the original website's disappearance.
            That is why we created this website.<br/>
            The website you are on right now is an archive that preserves (mostly) all of the stories from there.
            It was originally created as part of a translation project, so you might find one or two stories in russian on here too.

        <p>Below you can find the list of stories sorted from newest to oldest. You can use page navigation at the bottom of this page, filter by author or tag.</p>
