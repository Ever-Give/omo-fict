Michaela awoke to the feeling of Alyssa nibbling on her ear.
&quot;Morning sunshine, how are you feeling?&quot; Alyssa asked.
&quot;I feel fine,&quot; Michaela replied before turning over her body to look Alyssa in the eyes.
All the feelings of sheer embarrassment from the night before just washed away when she looked at her best friend. She kissed Aly on the lips and smiled. 
&quot;What do you wanna do today?&quot;
&quot;Well we don&#039;t have anywhere to be for a couple days, we could have a lil fun, yeah sweetie?&quot;
&quot;Like what kind of fun?&quot; Michaela asked
Alyssa sat up and crawled out of bed. She walked over to Michaela&#039;s closet and started…</p>
