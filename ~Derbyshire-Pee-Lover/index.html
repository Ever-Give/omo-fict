        <p class="card-text">I had worked with Claire for about three years when these events happened. She was a bubbly, outgoing character, very flirtatious and always willing to share a dirty joke or two.We were never more than work colleagues, friends I suppose, but certainly never romantically involved.It was the middle of a typical British summer and the night of the office barbecue.Surprisingly, it wasn&#039;t raining, but the promise of storms to come on the weather forecast didn&#039;t bode well.The barbecue was always held in the large garden of a pub near to the offices, and we basically took the place over for the evening.Plenty of food and plenty of drink was had by all, but eventually it was time to head for home.I had a fairly long…</p>

        <p class="card-text">As promised, here&#039;s my next posting in the &quot;Sarah&quot; series. I&#039;ve researched this carefully this evening and the timings seem about right. I was loading the washing machine after 90 minutes this evening, but I already had a cup of tea and a beer inside me when I started. Read on – you&#039;ll see what I&#039;m going on about!
Once again, this is pure fantasy, sadly there is no Sarah, and all events are fictitious.
After our experiences on the beach, I couldn&#039;t wait to find out what Sarah had in mind for a holding on contest. I had to wait until we got home, because she said what she had planned would be far too messy to contemplate in the B&amp;B we had been staying at in Cornwall.
The following weekend she outlined the …</p>

        <p class="card-text">Unlike my previous submissions, this one is at least based in fact. Sarah is still a figment of my imagination, as are the other characters in this tale, but most of these events did happen...
31st December 1999, and the prospect of the biggest party either of us had ever seen had Sarah and myself traveling south to London to join in the fun. We decided that the best policy would probably be to leave the car well outside the city center and take a train to Waterloo; so early in the evening we left the car at Feltham and continued our journey by rail. We arrived at Waterloo at about 7:00pm and set about deciding on a good spot to watch the fireworks from. Close to the London Eye seemed a good prospect but the…</p>

        <p class="card-text">This is my first attempt at posting here – hope you like it. This is also a fantasy – there is no Sarah and the events portrayed are completely fictitious.
I&#039;d been going out with Sarah for quite some time, and we had a fairy normal boyfriend/girlfriend relationship in all respects. I had never mentioned my interest in watersports and I&#039;d never had the slightest indication that she was interested either. Then one day we decided to go to the seaside. We wanted somewhere fairly secluded, so the trip turned into a long weekend in Cornwall. I don&#039;t remember exactly where we ended up – we stayed at a B&amp;B in Truro, but we drove for quite a while before we found what we were looking for. The beach was perfect – a…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Once again, this is very loosely based on a real event, but all the characters are pure fiction.
About five or six years ago, soon after Sarah and I first met, she came to me with an idea for a short break. She had seen some information about a riding center in the Scottish Highlands, where you could ride out around Loch Ness, and being a keen horsewoman she thought it might be fun to combine that with a few days&#039; holiday. I was OK with the idea, as I love the Scottish mountains, so the idea became a plan. She also asked if a friend of hers, Abigail, could come along too. We booked rooms at a B&amp;B in the village of Drumnadrochit, which is right on the edge of Loch Ness and very close to the riding center,…</p>
