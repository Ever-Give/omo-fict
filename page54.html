        <p class="card-text">I was at a cocktail party to say goodbye to the graduating seniors, as I am a sophomore history major. All of my professors were there and it was really important to make a good impression, as they would be writing my recommendation letters in the future. I dressed in a conservative blouse with tight gray matching pants and jacket. It looked conservative but good. On the way there I drank a bottle of water, as it was quite hot. I didn&#039;t worry about having to go to the bathroom, as I knew I could go there. When I got there I began talking to one of my Profs. He offered me a glass of apple juice and I didn&#039;t want to refuse, so I took it and drank it while we talked. As I walked around the room, one of my best…</p>

I won&#039;t go into what happened that evening as for one it was between Stacey and I and secondly, it has nothing to do with pee. It&#039;s enough for you to know that it was a great evening, and one that I will never forget. As I woke up the next morning, Stacey was curled up in the crook of my arm contently sleeping. That was great, and I gazed on her beautiful face. However, I couldn&#039;t gaze long for I needed the ever–necessary morning piss. I quietly slipped out of bed and walked into the bathroom for a leak. I was so preoccupied with getting ready to take much–needed piss I didn&#039;t even hear Stacey come up behind me. She reached around and took my cock in her hand and said let…</p>

        <p class="card-text">When Katie and Jill auditioned for the village pantomime, they had no idea what satisfaction they would derive from it. Both were reasonable actors, and very good looking, with the sort of figures that look great in costume. So they were not surprised when Jill got the part of the principal boy, &quot;Jack,&quot; and Katie the part of &quot;Alice&quot;. Now as everyone knows the story of PUSS IN BOOTS will remember, the story features Jack as the boy who becomes lord mayor of London, and Alice as Baron Hardups beautiful daughter who becomes Jack&#039;s Sweetheart. Rehearsals began, and the two girls found they had lots affectionate scenes together and one in which Alice declares her undying love for Jack, kissing him passionately.…</p>

As usual, she was dressed in her favorite outfit of dark panty hose under a very, very short miniskirt and a halter–top that left her navel bare. She wore her long brown hair in a rugged ponytail, making her look younger than her twenty–eight years.She wiped the sweat from her forehead as we returned to the table, heading for a cold coke. The place was quite crowded, and a group of people had sat down right next to us. Cecily nodded at the girl beside her, stretched her legs under the table and finished the coke.

The circumstances seem right when she fidgets, or moves her legs, or pats her belly, or seems to look at the door while mumbling I&#039;m sorry, where&#039;s the – I&#039;ve got to... Then comes the question: –Can I come with you? Some girls just stare at me. Some laugh. Some giggle and shake their heads. Some need to be convinced. Some girls look me in the eyes and nod.

        <p class="card-text">My experience with hospitals and clinics has been limited, because I have generally been in good health. My last hospital visit was for a maternity event, some twenty years ago. The product of that experience has now grown up and found her way to college, so you can guess I can no longer claim to be in the fresh bloom of youth. Nonetheless, with my fifty years, I certainly do not consider myself old, or, I hope, completely unattractive. My experience with the clinic really began with an auto accident. I was in a collision, in which no one was injured seriously (except the car), but I did suffer from some minor damage. My right ankle and foot were cut rather badly, and obviously bruised.

One evening my boss had left me to mind the store on my own, because he had to attend some social thing with his wife. I had lost track of time, trying to work out the numbers for the day. I had been on my own in the store for some time when –just before closing time– a lady entered. She walked right up to the shoe racks and started looking at the shoes. I took a minute or two to look at her. She was in her late twenties or early thirties, not very tall with dark blonde, shoulder long hair. She was wearing a red sweater, a tight red spandex miniskirt and black pumps. She didn&#039;t wear nylons. Her legs were quite tanned and muscular…</p>
