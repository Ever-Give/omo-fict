        <p class="card-text">My name is Molly and my friend is Steffine. One day my neighbor asked us to babysit for their 5 year old girl and 8 year old boy. We went there right after school and Steffine didn&#039;t have time to stop at the bathrooms because the owner of the house said that we had to be there right after school. It was a long walk to their house. On our way there she said &quot;we gotta hurry, I haven&#039;t stopped at the toilets since lunch.&quot; So we started to pick up the pace to get to their house. Halfway there she said &quot;Stop for a second&quot; she then hunched over and put her hands in her crotch and started to groan. I asked her if she was alright and she said she was just fine and that she could make it. She regained herself and we…</p>

My mom wasn&#039;t able to go so I went with my little sister. We drove there and there were about 75 little girls and their mothers also. We got out and I found my friend Ashlie. I was talking to Ashlie for a while when we decided to go out to the clubs tonight. It was perfect because my little sister already asked to stay at one of her friends&#039; house. I said it would be all right with me. Anyway we left and stopped at her house and then stopped at my house to change quickly and then we were off.

        <p class="card-text">For some reason, I have always been shy about telling anyone that I needed to use the bathroom. Most of the time, if there were no facilities around when my need arose, I just held it silently. This story is about one of those times, but after a few hours, I could no longer keep silent (or dry)!!!
Chris and I awoke early. It was a beautiful summer Saturday and we planned to get our errands done early, and then enjoy the day together doing absolutely nothing but enjoying nature. We went to the supermarket, the dry–cleaners, the pharmacy, and the garden shop. After all of this running around, we stopped at a diner for breakfast.

        <p class="card-text">This is a prelude to &quot;My Dilemma&quot;. This is the first desperation experience I had with Cindy.
Cindy and I met as freshman in collage and quickly began dating. She was an &quot;Army Brat&quot; and was just settling in to a new environment. Being the daughter of an Army Col. she was used to moving allot and making friends quickly. Cindy had that girl next door kind of beauty. Not a stunning model/actress kind of look, but a pretty, wholesome face with a body that would cause any man to sin. She was only 5&#039;2&quot; tall but was a perfect 36C–22–34, with not the slightest sag in her beautiful, pert, full breasts. One of the great things about dating Cindy was the fact that she had varied interests and was up for just about…</p>

For one thing, it was the first time I ever got to see her pee for this happened before the drive in situation I described in Cindy&#039;s Dilemma. The second thing that makes it memorable for me was the way the evening started. It was Saturday evening and we decided to go out to a bar with some friends and just drink and relax a little. It had been a long week of school and work for both of us and we just wanted some time to relax, talk with friends, listen to some music and have a quiet good time. On the way to the bar in my Mercury Cindy began to tell how embarrassed she had been the night before. I had to work on Friday night and…</p>

There she was, in the cinema watching a horror film with her sister Jen, and the film so frightened her that though was dying to pee, she was afraid to go on to the toilet in the dark all alone. Jen was engrossed in the film and refused to accompany her. Now, peeing herself would not have worried her as she had done it in this very cinema a number of times, often brought on from being masturbated by Ian, her boy friend. Frigging her while she was dying to pee but could no longer resist coming, she had enjoyed a delightful combination that could only…</p>

No, it wasn&#039;t the end of the day. There was one more class to go. And not every student was consumed by this passion. No, the good feelings were limited to the handful of students whose next class would be taught by the one, the only, Ms. Timberlake. Ms. Timberlake was the most popular teacher in school, probably the most popular person, more popular than the head cheerleader, prom queen and homecoming queen combined.

She hadn&#039;t been to the bathroom all day, and the coke at lunch plus all the water she drank during P.E. were ready to make their exit from her. Normally this wouldn&#039;t be a problem, but some street workers outside the high school had hit a water line, and the water had to be shut off to the school. Quickly after that, the administrators locked all the bathrooms to prevent any messes and problems. There were supposed to be port–a–potties on the way, but so far not one had appeared.Mr. Rawlins was talking about Dickens in their English class, so Carly was bored enough that all she could think of…</p>

We went to this restaurant – Michael Jordan’s in downtown Chicago. We must have gotten kind of tipsy at dinner, as we were both stumbling a bit afterwards. I started to notice that she seemed to be fidgeting as well, so I asked her if she was OK. She said yes. Ten minutes later, she whispered in my ear &quot; Do you know where a bathroom is?&quot; I knew that the closest one was about three blocks down in the Art Institute, and also that it was closed, but I told her that one was just down the street.

She looked a real picture, even while doing the housework, wearing a white blouse, short black skirt, and tanned pantyhose (tights).
