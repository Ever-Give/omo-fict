        <p class="card-text">It was finally the end of the day on Friday and Nikki was more than ready for the weekend. It had been a rough week at work and Nikki was ready for two days of relaxation and time with Tyler. To prepare herself she had been drinking lots of water all afternoon. Of course, she had had to pee several times in order not to embarrass herself at the office, but that was OK. She knew she was well hydrated and that she now only needed to drink a little to fill her bladder enough to make her hot and intensify her horniness.
She stopped in the staff kitchen on her way out of the office to fill up her water bottle and then headed out to the car. On the way home she fantasized about what she might do with Tyler tonight.…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Nikki and Tyler had not had as much time to spend together as Nikki wanted. She had been working hard and had been tired after work and Tyler had had to work late many nights. So by the weekend Nikki was ready to close out the whole world and concentrate only on each other.
Friday night was a wash because Nikki and Tyler were so tired they just popped in a DVD and watched a movie until they fell asleep. However, Nikki woke up energetic and horny. Tyler was still sleeping when she climbed out of bed. She skipped her usual morning potty stop and held it until she stepped into the shower. She waited to turn on the water and stood there naked savoring her full bladder. She ran a finger between her vaginal lips…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Nikki had the day off work and was home alone. It was a warm summer day and Nikki was wearing one of those long flowing gauze skirts that you twist after you wash it. She was also wearing a cute little white t–shirt that showed off her tan tummy. She wore nothing on her feet because she liked to feel to cool floors when she walked around the house.
It was a little after noon and Nikki was relaxing on the couch reading a book. As was her habit, she had already had quite a lot of liquid to drink– orange juice with breakfast, a large tea, and several glasses of water.
Nikki&#039;s reason for constantly sipping water was not only for the health benefits, but also because of a little fetish she had. Nobody, but her…</p>
