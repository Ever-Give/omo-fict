        <p class="card-text">I wrote about our last experiment. We had great success chilling her bladder with an ice pack. Mary was intent on holding her bursting bladder much longer...she is usually so strong that way. She does it for me because it&#039;s the ultimate turn on for me. However, the ice pack on her pelvis broke her will in less that one minute.
So, I got to thinking about other ways to chill her. I wish we had a walk–in freezer, but we don&#039;t. I imagined using the freezer at the local pizza joint, but I knew the owner wouldn&#039;t appreciate the mess.
I thought about waiting until the cold weather returns, but that&#039;s months away.
All of a sudden, I knew the solution. We have a 2–quart enema bag hanging in the closet. We use it…</p>

        <p class="card-text">My girlfriend Mary has always been interested in pee play. We&#039;ve done all the usual stuff and I was looking for a new way to spice up the action. One day we got a package in the mail that had freezer gel packs to keep the contents cold. I looked at those gel packs and looked at Mary. I told her the gel packs would be part of our next bladder control scene. She got a terrified look on her face because she knew exactly what I had in mind.
That night we went to the local tavern for dinner and a few brews. I told Mary not to pee because I wanted to feel her swollen and hard bladder before we made love. She does this often and it turns us both on. We had 3 or 4 beers that night. She had no problem avoiding the…</p>
