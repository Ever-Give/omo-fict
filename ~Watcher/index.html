        <p class="card-text">It was several weeks since Kate&#039;s incident with the scan. On several occasions, she&#039;d experimented at home with pee–holding games, drinking several strong cups of coffee and then waiting until she was bursting before allowing herself the luxury of going to the toilet. She found that the feeling of desperation aroused her sexually. On a couple of occasions she&#039;d had minor &quot;accidents,&quot; caused by her younger siblings occupying the bathroom at inconvenient moments, just as she&#039;d decided she couldn&#039;t wait any longer. There was a thrill in the unexpected need to hold on for an additional few minutes, and once she&#039;d started leaking as she had that day of the scan– with spurts of pee had began coming out every few…</p>

        <p class="card-text">The instructions in the letter from the hospital were quite clear. &quot;Drink at least 2 pints of water before you attend for Ultrasound scanning, and do not relieve yourself until after the scan. It is important for good results that your bladder is full at the time of the scan.&quot;
Kate was a normally healthy, slender 18–year–old, but she had been having trouble with pains in her abdomen, and the doctor had referred her to the hospital for a scan to see if anything would show up. Now she looked at the letter again. The appointment was for 10:30 a.m., so she didn&#039;t need to leave the house until at least 10, the hospital was only about 15 minutes&#039; walk away.
On the morning of the appointment, the alarm clock rang…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Tassja knew that she would be in trouble with the Gang after reporting them for what she&#039;d seen them doing to some unfortunate younger girl. The Gang... everybody in school knew about the Gang, even the teachers, although there wasn&#039;t much they could do about them. Once or twice members of the Gang were hauled before the headmistress, but it didn&#039;t make any difference. The Gang was the ultimate bad girls, into everything that was forbidden, sleazy, or preferably both, and with a complete disregard for authority.
Tassja normally kept well clear, but this time she&#039;d seen them basically torturing their victim, and her conscience hadn&#039;t let her rest, though she knew it was a bad move to annoy them. For the next…</p>

The story begins with taking a minibus–load of people to see a concert at Wembley a few years ago.
Naturally, you can&#039;t get parked anywhere near, so the minibus was in a small car park about a quarter of a mile away. I&#039;d walked back to the stadium, to try and spot the party I was collecting. Naturally, a large crowd of people was coming out, and most of them were walking down the access road, which was about a quarter of a mile, I guess, although I bet it seemed further to the girl in the pink dress.
She was slim, and…</p>

        <p class="card-text">It was a cold, wet, stormy night. The house was warm, though, the wood–burning stove defied the wind and rain outside.
Ellen had been sitting near the fire. She&#039;d also had several mugs of drink during the evening; but now it was bedtime, past bedtime in fact. She went to clean her teeth and pee before going upstairs – there wasn&#039;t space upstairs for a bathroom, which meant that getting up in the night for the toilet could be a chilly experience.
Once in her pajamas she quickly got into bed. For a while she read a book, but soon she felt sleepy, so she put the light out and went to sleep.
Some time later, she woke up, for no apparent reason. The wind was still howling outside, and rain lashed against the…</p>
