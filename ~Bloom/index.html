        <p class="card-text">About 10 years ago, a woman in her late 30s or at the most 40 lived next door to me. She had a husband and teenage son who were away during the day at work and school. Her role was housewife, and during the warm weather months she was out working in her yard and garden most days.
Our backyards happened to be separated by a chain link fence and I could look into her yard and watch her from my kitchen window, which I often did, as she was quite easy on the eyes. She was ever–so–slightly on the plump side, with high, pointed, perfectly shaped breasts, a nice little roundness to her belly, a marvelously shaped butt, smooth, youthful–looking legs, and a cheerful, outgoing personality.

        <p class="card-text">Joe was a good guy, an older friend always willing to take some risks on our behalf. He said he&#039;d be glad to pick up a case of beer for us. We were all under 21 and too young to buy beer in the state where we lived in the Northeastern United States.
At the senior prom dance that June evening in the mid–1950s, I danced only with Maddy, a girl I&#039;d been going with for about a year. We were kindred spirits, similar interests, but where I was shy and retiring, she was bubbly and outgoing. I was very comfortable with her. She drew me out and helped me overcome my shyness.
