        <p class="card-text">My experience with hospitals and clinics has been limited, because I have generally been in good health. My last hospital visit was for a maternity event, some twenty years ago. The product of that experience has now grown up and found her way to college, so you can guess I can no longer claim to be in the fresh bloom of youth. Nonetheless, with my fifty years, I certainly do not consider myself old, or, I hope, completely unattractive. My experience with the clinic really began with an auto accident. I was in a collision, in which no one was injured seriously (except the car), but I did suffer from some minor damage. My right ankle and foot were cut rather badly, and obviously bruised. I had an assortment of…</p>

        <p class="card-text">It was September, and a tradition in our company that a social gathering for the employees was held in the fall of each year. Our office was a regional center for an insurance company, and we had about forty employees. Most of us knew each other, and I really didn&#039;t socialize with my fellow workers much outside of office hours.
My name is Joe – really, Joseph Carnavo. I&#039;m twenty four, and been with the company for two years. I was never much of an extrovert, and my social life after college has really been pretty limited. I live alone in my own apartment, and I suppose people think of me as a bit of a nerd – in the last couple of years I&#039;ve rarely dated, and girls don&#039;t tend to call me.

This story is set in the Soviet Union, beginning in the Communist era, when two women tourists decide to ignore the rules on export of restricted items. There are consequences for both, for one humiliating and the other highly inconvenient. The story involves a sequel, when there is a return to scene at a later time.
Chapter 1 Alone at Last
Irma Bradley and her friend and companion Helen Murzac stood at the entrance to the modest hotel they had occupied with their tour group for the last several days. They were waving farewell to the others of the group with whom they had been touring the Soviet Union for the past two weeks. The time was 1983, the place a town not far from…</p>

While Kevin, a divorced man of 45, lived in Melbourne, and had taken the opportunity to assist at the convention in Perth to be able to enjoy a bit of holiday on the west coast and spend some time with his sister, who lived in the area.

She had deliberately chosen this route, for she loved the outdoors and especially the cool forest in the summer. It was a warm July afternoon, and her thoughts turned back to the days, many years earlier, when she had spent summers with her parents on a farm adjoining woods, not unlike those she was passing through.
