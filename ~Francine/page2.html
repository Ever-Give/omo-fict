        <p class="card-text">This story is based on a real incident related to the author, although the names and some details have been changed. It involves a female soldier driving male officers around isolated construction sites in the American southwest in the midst of World War II. Restrained by female modesty and military decorum she endures a long drive without the opportunity to relieve herself, until eventually necessity becomes so great as to overcome restraint. W/s, mostly &quot;hold it&quot;
In the spring of 1943 it was warming up in the American southwest. The war was on in earnest, and military construction was under way in many formerly isolated areas. Women were beginning to appear in some numbers in the army, and were no longer a…</p>

        <p class="card-text">This is a story involving action mostly between young teenagers (no pedo, no child abuse involved). The principal character is a shy young teenaged boy who finds himself temporarily assigned to a girls school, where the facility is marked by a lack of male bathrooms. No hard sex, just a bit of watersports, desperation (male, mostly), and a touch of exhibitionism. mf (teen) w/s exhib.
Eddie Michelson was, perhaps, not entirely a typical fourteen year old. In his midwestern locality, morals and family values were held in high esteem, and this was especially true in his own family. His father, an engineer, and his mother, a physical therapist in a local hospital, did the best to get their two sons quality…</p>

        <p class="card-text">This little story is a personal experience, and the one which aroused my interest in writing stories about desperation. I have always had some interest in desperation situations, but not until this event did I realize how arousing a woman&#039;s badly distended bladder could be to her male companion. In this case it was mine! This was such a personal matter that it took me a long time to muster the courage to relate it. Now that I have recorded it, others may enjoy reading it. While I can recall the event with some enjoyment now, and my interest in desperation is as deep as ever, I do not again want to carry it this far!
For those who have an interest in an experience where a lady&#039;s bladder became so full it…</p>
