        <p class="card-text">The day after I&#039;d witnessed Katherine wet herself after waiting for hours to get to a loo, I wasn&#039;t at all sure how she would react. She had been humiliated by being forced to pee in her clothes in front of me, an accident I was responsible for, albeit indirectly. Now that she&#039;d had time to think things over, I felt sure she would decide to tender her resignation and move on, rather than having to face the awkwardness of working alongside me.
It had been good while it lasted, I told myself. She had asked for a shot at the job, despite the difficulties created by the lack of female facilities, but things had gone hopelessly wrong on her very first day. I didn&#039;t see how she could deal with the embarrassment.…</p>

        <p class="card-text">As Area Manager of a Regional Water Authority in Britain, I was responsible not only for the quality of water in reservoirs of the region I liked to call my patch, but also for all the sewage treatment works in that area.
When the Authority created my position, it was in advance of suitable offices being built at a number of locations throughout the county. The situation on my patch was no different, and for the first year in the job, I had to work out of a large portacabin.
The portacabin was not as grim as it might sound. It was well appointed, with reasonable office furniture, plenty of heat, microwave and kettle, and so on. The only questionable thing about this mobile office was that the powers that be…</p>

It looked marvellous on her tall, willowy form, and she knew it. The choice made specifically for her performance evaluation that afternoon, looked smart, professional, and elegant, a garment to suit board members from the highly conservative to the outright lascivious.
Victoria knew she was a hot contender for promotion to Assistant Regional Director of Highline Apparel, probably the fastest growing quality fashion chain on the east coast. She needed to look the part if she was going to go places within the company.

The damned place was always short of staff, and her stints on the checkout were always far longer than they were supposed to be.

When I was eighteen, I spent four weeks in hospital after falling off a roof and breaking both arms, dislocating one and giving my back a nasty jolt. I spent quite a lot of this time with my arms encased in itchy plaster and suspended by wires to prevent me from moving them. I was lucky that my father had the kind of job that offered good medical cover, and I had a private room. To be honest, I would rather have been in one of the wards with other kids my age so that I would have had people to talk to, but since the insurance company was paying, my dad wanted me to have the best.

She was prevented her from satisfying the urge to relieve herself by her responsibility to her company. As deputy CEO of Wiseman Electronics, it was incumbent upon her to show leadership and always appear in control of the situation.

Helen had devoted her Saturday to watching all three parts of Peter Jackson&#039;s &quot;Lord of the Rings.&quot; I watched most of it with her, especially the third part of the trilogy. The fun began about an hour before the end of the film. Even though we were watching it at home and could pause the DVD at any time, Helen didn&#039;t like to take breaks during movies since, in her view, it killed the atmosphere.
She had been leaning her head on my shoulder for about half an hour when I noticed her rubbing her hand against her stomach. &quot;Eaten too much?&quot; I asked.
&quot;Ssshhh,&quot; she said suppressively, so I didn&#039;t think any more of it for a while. After another ten minutes or so, however, I…</p>

She had consoled herself with lunch at an eatery on the top floor of the mall calling itself the Cottage Garden.

        <p class="card-text">I first saw her as I was walking along the main concourse at Kennedy Airport, looking for the departure gate for the American Airlines flight to San Francisco. She was perched up on one of the metal railings, shoes off and peering down at her feet. A slim blonde, probably in her mid–twenties, I could not help but admire how apt was her appearance– I&#039;d already recognized her flight attendant uniform as belonging to the Scandinavian Airlines (or SAS) stable. She was simply very cute, and as hard as I tried not to stare at her as passed, I just couldn&#039;t help myself.
She glanced up and caught me looking, but instead of quickly avoiding my gaze the way most western women would do, she smiled. It was an electric…</p>

        <p class="card-text">We woke late, not surprisingly. When I opened my eyes, I found Julia&#039;s face before me, her head propped up on her hand. She smiled and rubbed her left leg against my thigh –– such a wonderful way to start the day and I did not suppress the groan at the pleasure it brought me. I reached down and stroked her thigh as it came within reach, relishing the softness of her skin.
&quot;That was quite a revelation last night,&quot; she said, smirking, her blue eyes peeping through the strands of her fringe. &quot;Why didn&#039;t you tell me about your.... interest before?&quot;
&quot;Why do you think?&quot; I said, shrugging slightly. &quot;I didn&#039;t think you&#039;d be interested. More likely, I thought it would scare you off.&quot;
She considered this for a moment…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Sue James badly needed to pee. In fact, she was absolutely bursting.
Waiting impatiently at yet another red light, she snatched the opportunity to tightly clench her thighs, something she found very difficult to do when actually driving. She closed her eyes, slapping the palm of her left hand repeatedly against the edge of the steering wheel. She had no idea why this should help her fight off the nearly–overwhelming urge to release the contents of her swollen bladder, but it did.
&quot;Oh, come on!&quot; she complained to the traffic light whose baleful red stare had halted her progress. The pain was growing intolerable.
Of course, she&#039;d been forced to hold on to a full bladder often enough in her career, especially…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Belle couldn&#039;t believe Michael had just left her here, tied up all evening with this damned ball in her mouth and her bladder really aching from being full for so long.
When he&#039;d suggested tying her up for the evening, she had been excited. This kind of foreplay had such a profound effect on Michael and invariably led to the most amazing sex. She had agreed readily, and without giving her time to reconsider, Michael had promptly dragged into the bedroom and started tying her up.
&quot;You&#039;re keen,&quot; she had remarked as he bound her wrists and pulled up a chair to secure one end of the rope to the overhead beam, preventing her from sitting down. He had looked down at her from his precarious perch and waggled his…</p>
