        <p class="card-text">Elizabeth is taking a walk through the forest with her sisters. They&#039;re on holidays and decided to go out to enjoy the wild. Suddenly Michelle stops, and Alyssa and Elizabeth turn around to see what&#039;s going on.
Michelle: &quot;Wait a minute girls, I have to pee, can&#039;t hold it anymore.&quot;
Elizabeth guesses that her sister is going to go behind the bushes, or even pull down her jeans and panties to squat right there, but gets surprised seeing Michelle just standing still and closing her eyes. From where she stands she can&#039;t see anything unusual, but now she&#039;s looking at her from behind and sees two lines of wetness starting to form down her sister&#039;s legs as a wet stain grows in her ass.
Elizabeth: &quot;MICHELLE! You&#039;re…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Elizabeth, Alyssa and Michelle had a free night, and decided to go out and have fun. They went to the movies, and then to a bar to watch some band play. It was a sisters&#039; night out. They stayed at the bar a couple of hours, drinking, looking at guys and chatting about recent events (except for Elizabeth and Alyssa don&#039;t share certain secrets with their little sister). Then they decided it was late and went home. Michelle took a bus, while Elizabeth walked Alyssa to their mother&#039;s home, since her sister was pretty drunk. Considering that their mother was out on a trip, she decided to stay all night with her sister, so they took a cab and headed home. Alyssa was barely able to stay awake during the trip, and…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Michelle is feeling that familiar sensation in her bladder, telling her that she had been holding too long and it&#039;s time to go to the toilet. It&#039;s past noon and she hasn&#039;t moved from her desk since she arrived that morning. And worse, all the coffee she drunk all morning has since descended to her bladder.
In another situation she wouldn&#039;t have gave it a second thought and would have walked the thirty steps that separated her office from the toilets (two of them, shared with the rest of the offices on the floor), but that time she couldn&#039;t do it because her sister (the only one that worked with her in the family business) had gone out to do some errands. To being able to go to the toilet, she would&#039;ve had to…</p>

        <p class="card-text">A month has passed since the holding contest, and Elizabeth had forgotten about her suspicions that peeing herself sexually arouses her sister Alyssa. That time, while she was peeing her clothes sitting on the toilet, she would&#039;ve sworn that Alyssa was touching herself. But as the days passed by, she began to discard that idea, thinking that it was only her imagination, until something happened that reminded her of those suspicions.
Yesterday they were alone at their mother&#039;s house playing cards, drinking tea and eating crackers. Once during the game Elizabeth felt the need to pee, but she ignored it because the game was getting interesting, and later the urge passed. When the game was over, they took the…</p>

        <p class="card-text">The other day I was at the public park when I saw two girls in their twenties showing clear signals of being desperate to pee. That&#039;s not unusual here. During these beautiful warm days women go out to enjoy the sun, and since it&#039;s hot outside they drink a lot of water that ends up in their bladders. Since there are just a few public toilets around, it&#039;s usual to see girls in different stages of desperation, or squatting behind a tree or a bush, or even once in a while peeing themselves, just a little or completely, while waiting in line for the toilet.
What&#039;s odd about these two is to see them so desperate this early, when it&#039;s not even noon. Usually the best sightings are in the afternoon, after lunch,…</p>

The sisters where going to be alone in their mother&#039;s house all weekend long. Their mother had gone on a trip, so they met there to chat and remember the past. And if there was something to remember from the near past, it was the time they all peed themselves returning from the pub...
Michelle: &quot;Oh, please don&#039;t remind it to me, how embarrassing!&quot;
Elizabeth: &quot;but Michelle, it wasn&#039;t THAT bad...&quot;

The beers went by and the conversation was so interesting that they hadn&#039;t remembered to go to the bathroom, but finally they realised that their bladders were dangerously full. The first to notice it was the middle one.
Elizabeth: &quot;Girls, I&#039;ll be back in a minute, I need to use the toilet.&quot;

Alyssa: &quot;Hey, don&#039;t leave me here alone, you aren&#039;t the only ones that have several beers inside!&quot;

Max is driving (it&#039;s his car) and Barbara is sitting beside him, while I&#039;m behind her and by my side is Michele. Well, &quot;travelling&quot; is really just an expression, because we left the Zoo an hour ago and we&#039;re still half way from home, stuck on the highway in the middle of a traffic jam. For Max and I it&#039;s just an inconvenience, but for the ladies it&#039;s much worse. They&#039;re both dying for a pee, and they can&#039;t do anything about it but try to hold on.
All of this started when we were at the Zoo. As it was a Monday on a holiday weekend and also…</p>
