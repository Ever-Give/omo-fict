        <p class="card-text">Sorry it&#039;s taken me a while to have a story to share with you guys. I have been tied up in a serious relationship with my girlfriend Ashley and that hasn&#039;t really brought up any desperate situations. She is so hot and I love her to death. However, I have been wishing I could witness her in a desperate situation.
The last story I shared was about one of her friends who almost wet her pants on a way to a party. I was disappointed when she made it out dry. It&#039;s been a year or so since I have fooled around with Kendra in plotting &quot;accidents&quot;. I do keep in touch with her even though she too is dating someone right now.
But let me shift my attention to Ashley. Last week we had been shopping around at the mall all…</p>

        <p class="card-text">I know the title of the story kind of gives away the ending, but nonetheless this was my most recent desperation sighting.
A month ago or so my girlfriend invited me to hang with her and her friends one night. They were throwing a small bachelorette party for this one girl who was getting married in a couple of months. I was to be the only guy hanging out with these women on this night. They all liked me and didn&#039;t mind having me around. I would be kind of chauffeuring them around later that night as well.
I met my girlfriend Ashley at about nine o&#039;clock or so and headed over to this one girl&#039;s house where everyone was gathering. In thinking about the evening, it never crossed my mind that being around all…</p>

        <p class="card-text">So let&#039;s continue our adventure at the football game. We had a good time while at the game. You can&#039;t buy beer at the college games, of course, so we quenched our thirst with cokes and water.
During halftime we all took a trip to the bathroom. While on our way Kendra grabbed my arm and whispered in my ear, &quot;Mikey... how good was that earlier? I know I didn&#039;t wet myself like I promised but it felt so good trying to hold it. I just couldn&#039;t wet myself in front of all those people. Sorry, I hope you aren&#039;t disappointed...&quot;
&quot;Hey Kendra, that was pretty hot that all three of you had to go, especially Stacia. I really thought she wouldn&#039;t make it,&quot; I replied.
&quot;I know, I thought so too. It was a pretty close call…</p>

        <p class="card-text">I last left you with the story of my threesome with my neighbor Casey and her gorgeous friend Kendra. Casey and I had made a plan with the intention of making Kendra have an accident along with us. Our plan was almost successful, except that Kendra found a trashcan at the last second and used it as a toilet. I didn&#039;t even get to watch her unleash her flow, as she ran into another room. Nevertheless, Casey and I both had our intentional accidents and enjoyed a night long of sex with Kendra. It was amazing. (If you have no idea what I am talking about please read my previous story)
About three weeks passed when I got a call from Kendra. I totally didn&#039;t even expect to hear from her again, unless I ran into her…</p>

        <p class="card-text">So, I left you with my last experience with Casey. We had finally got a couple of things out in the open. She knew how turned on I was at the sight of her desperation. I knew how much she wanted to see me in a similar situation. 
A week or so after my experience with her she was hanging out at my apartment when somehow the topic came up. Casey expressed the interest of getting me into a situation where she could get me desperate to go. She said the ultimate goal was to see me soak myself. I was a bit turned on by the idea. I have previously written about a situation I had with a good friend of mine, Brooke, last Christmas when we had both wet ourselves. That turned into a pretty orgasmic situation. So I knew…</p>

        <p class="card-text">A couple of weeks ago I headed out to a concert with some friends, of which once again included my sexy neighbor Casey. After Casey&#039;s wet incident on her birthday the two of us had gotten closer and even a bit sexual together one night while watching a movie. So the night of this concert rolls around and Casey and I were picked up by three of our friends, Ben, D.J., and Hillary. We all rode to the show in Ben&#039;s Tahoe truck. We got there plenty early because we always like to tailgate and have some drinks before heading in. 
The concert was being held at a nearby arena and traffic was already getting backed up when we got there. By the time we found a parking spot it was pretty far off from the arena. 
That…</p>

        <p class="card-text">I began plotting ways to get my girlfriends into situations where they were at the brink with no restroom at their disposal. I know that sounds evil, but it has become such a turn on for me. A couple of weeks back one of my plans worked out better than I had thought it would. It all started one week when a girlfriend of mine from work, Pam, asked what I was doing over the weekend. I replied that I had not much in mind but suggested that maybe we could catch a movie or something. She sounded interested and asked me to call her with plans. A couple of days later I scanned the movie listings and saw that Lord of the Rings was playing. This grabbed my interest because my friends had seen it and told me that it was…</p>

        <p class="card-text">It was a week before Christmas when I received a call from my friend, April. In past years April and I traveled home to New Jersey together during the holidays. When she called we discussed our options for that next week. With everything being so hectic on the airlines these days we opted to drive home this holiday. So, on that day we were to drive home together April was actually running late. She lives an hour south of me these days and made the trip to my apartment that morning. By the time she arrived I was anxious to get on the road. She didn&#039;t need the restroom or anything so we got right in my Jeep and we were off.

        <p class="card-text">It is my pleasure to share this experience with you. It&#039;s one that I wish I could live over and over again.
A couple of months back I was joining one of my neighbors in celebrating her birthday. She had planned to have a limo take a bunch of us into the city to go to a club. Sounded fine to me. It was a horrible night out weather wise though. It had been pouring rain since early in the afternoon and showed no signs of slowing. 
The bunch of us included two other guys, five girls, all of who were very attractive, I must say, and myself. So off we headed, the city was about half an hour from our apartments. The drive on this night was taking a bit longer due to the heavy rain. On our way there I noticed some…</p>
