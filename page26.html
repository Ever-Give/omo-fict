        <p class="card-text">Lucy drew the bedroom curtains, switched on the answer phone, and placed her new purchase on the bed. Then she guiltily took off her dress and hung it up in the wardrobe. Next she kicked off her shoes. Finally she took off her knickers and bra, and dropped them in the laundry basket in the en–suite. When she was totally naked, she nervously picked up her new purchase. It was a pair of light blue knickers with a floral print pattern.
She stepped into the knickers and quickly pulled them up; then she stood in front of the mirror on her wardrobe door, and studied her reflection intently. She looked much as she remembered looking that dreadful day, 15 years ago, when she had last worn a pair of knickers with a…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Any of you who work in construction will know that, occasionally, a zip–tight bladder is pretty much essential. Whilst I was at university (on my year placement) I really learned the hard way! It wasn&#039;t the first time I&#039;d wet my knickers – either in public or privately ;–) – but doing it at work was never top of my list!
I was working with a firm of architects and was asked to go and do some survey drawings at an English cathedral. This involved going up into the roof space and then climbing down onto scaffolding about 25 meters above–ground on the outside of the building. I love this kind of stuff about my job and was really chuffed when the practice manager said I could handle the work myself.
I drove up…</p>

I went to a different state, with two of my best friends, and our parents bought a house for us to live in. They did it on a few conditions. We had to maintain the building (they would pay back the bills, but we had to arrange the repairs and if we could do them ourselves. We had to progress in college, so no partying all night, each night. We had to come back home on a regular basis and finally we had to take care of the bills. We didn&#039;t have to pay rent, but they didn&#039;t give us any money to live off of (they did pay college tuition and our books and stuff). We thought it to be a good deal and we took it.

        <p class="card-text">*** Why Is The Bed Wet?
I met this girl named Kate about a year ago. We were both 25 at the time and we have been dating since. Things were going well for us. But recently Kate began having this problem...
&quot;Kate, Why is the bed wet?&quot; I asked as I woke her up from a sleep.
&quot;WHAT?&quot; Kate yelled as she sat right up in bed. &quot;Oh my god! I ... I wet the bed!&quot; Kate was sitting in a large puddle in the bed. The sheets were wet enough that you could see liquid being squeezed out of the fabric as she moved. I woke because I felt the wetness seep over to my side of the bed and found my pajamas wet as well. Kate had a sheer panic look on her face and tears were forming in her eyes.
&quot;Shhh ... Kate it&#039;s ok, accidents…</p>

So drink they did. Each person had a large drink, followed by a small coffee. Jas topped it off with a beer. They headed back to the same room they had come from, to find it clean and empty. They removed their clothes, and sat on the large bed in the room. This is how they positioned themselves:

After more than two years of trying to get tickets, design a costume and the ordeal of auditions, the cute young housewife in the pigtails and the schoolgirl plaid skirt had often thought this moment would never come. Her white blouse and short, very short, skirt really accented her youthful figure. Hanna leapt to her feet and made her way to the stage, her plaid skirt flying, revealing glimpses of white cotton panty as she took steps two at a time. The camera operator, used to all manner of spectacle at the show, was distracted in spite of his experience and drew in close as Hanna&#039;s panties again made an appearance. &quot;Sweet, sweet, sweet!&quot; he spoke…</p>

Ms. C_ always wore nice flowing knee high hemmed skirts and when we were all sitting on the classroom mat she would squat down in front of us to talk.
This would always get the attention of all the boys, myself included, because Ms. C_ would sometimes forget to tuck her skirt behind her knees and we would get a free peepshow of her underwear. After that we were left talking about what…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Amoeba
21–year–old woke up one morning and tossed off her sheets, which were slightly damp. She reached down and felt the bottom of her light blue cotton thong, which was fairly dry, but still a little damp. She cursed her small bladder and got out of bed, her long blonde hair flowing down to just above her tight little ass. She shook out of her panties, letting them drop the floor, and ripped the sheets off the bed, moving to the kitchen and putting them in the washer. She noticed the time was 8:50 and wanted to leave at 9 for her shopping, so she ran back into her room and threw open her drawer, grabbing a pair of pink cotton bikini panties, pulling them over her long legs and covering her delicate bush.…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Holly strolled through the city shops without a care in the world. She was browsing for some new sports clothes, window–shopping mainly, and her only purchase so far had been a large coke from McDonalds. Holly was an outgoing girl, and was enjoying being 18 and home from college for the summer. She was wearing an old pair of ripped jeans that she had cut off into shorts, and a red vest with &quot;Party Girl&quot; emblazoned across her firm round breasts. The vest was tight and short, showing her nipples since she wasn&#039;t wearing a bra, while leaving her tummy bare and exposed. She felt the cool air over her bare skin as the afternoon cooled gradually. She took slow, rolling strides from her hips as she walked, and smiled…</p>

        <p class="card-text">My girlfriend, Michelle, and I went on a trip out of town a few weeks ago. We drove to a town that about 8 hours away to see a really big concert– the biggest event of the year. We had been looking forward to it for a long time (all weekend alone together... away from home). So we packed up our bags, loaded into my SUV, and headed off. We made it there in good time. Checked into a hotel. All that. So for two days we strolled around the concert grounds enjoying all the live performances by all the bands. And each night, we&#039;d wind up having even more fun in our hotel room– and in the hotel hot tubs (but that&#039;s another story).
Anyway... The bathrooms at the concert weren&#039;t wonderful, but they weren&#039;t the…</p>

        <p class="card-text">A Competition Becomes a Never Ending Nightmare
If I had superhuman abilities, I would like to get invisible and to have mind–control over strong bladdered women. It should be possible to find them by their thoughts while they are holding it. Afterwards I would read and manipulate their minds while looking inside of them while they are doing their best to hold it.
Then the following situation would be possible. Possibly it could also happen without any manipulation, just because these two women are very ambitious and really tough.
Note from Ger: This story is of course complete fiction. Don&#039;t even try to hold your pee as long as written below. Not even in a kind of sadistic game. Holding your pee too long –…</p>

        <p class="card-text">It&#039;s a long–assed way from the nation&#039;s armpit to its belly button. We were driving all the way from home (NE, US) to southern Indiana, where we planned to ride our bikes (along with 250 other bike nuts) hundreds of miles through the hill country. We decided to split the drive into 2 days and play along the way. Early on the morning of day 2 we stopped in Wal–Mart to pick up another camp chair so there would be someplace to sit at the end of the day...just in case. After we found the perfect chair, and restocked the cooler with water and soft drinks, I started for the checkout line.
But OSO headed me off, herding me instead to the pharmacy section. He&#039;d never been in this town before in his life, but he…</p>
