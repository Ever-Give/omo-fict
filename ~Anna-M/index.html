        <p class="card-text">Hello, my name is Anna M. If you haven&#039;t read any of my other stories, here&#039;s a quick intro: I&#039;m a girl who only pees at home, no matter what! I pee in the morning before I leave and then just hold it in till I get back home in the evening... some people call that an &quot;All Day Girl.&quot; :–)
Well, this is a story about the time I had to take an ultrasound scan last year. Routine check. As you must know, a full bladder is a requirement to take it and of course most girls just RUN to the bathroom just as soon as it&#039;s over... but I of course don&#039;t :–) Read on...
One time last year I had an appointment for an ultrasound scan and of course one must have a full bladder for it. Since I hate drinking loads of water, I…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Hello, my name is Anna. I&#039;m 24, blonde; slim, neither tall nor short.
If you&#039;ve read my other story, you know I pride myself on my good bladder control. I&#039;m one of those girls who never seems to pee...
I usually leave all my pee for when I get home.
But I wasn&#039;t always like that... back when I was in college my bladder wasn&#039;t all that strong and didn&#039;t have that much capacity. I guess I was just &#039;normal&#039; :) Anyway, one day I arrived late for a test, didn&#039;t pee first, got desperate, you get the picture (I&#039;ll tell it in some other story), and ended up failing the course because I had to leave the test early to pee so I didn&#039;t answer all the questions.
I was so mad at myself that day that I decided to set a…</p>

        <p class="card-text">My name is Anna and I&#039;m 24 years old, blonde, thin but not a skeleton, and neither tall nor short... well enough description. Anyway, since I was a kid I&#039;ve always had the habit of only peeing at home when possible, so I developed pretty good bladder control. One day I was coming back from a trip with Jessica and Dave, two friends of mine. It was a five hour car trip so as we were coming close to a gas station Dave asked if we should stop to pee. That was after 4 hours of travelling. Jessica was in pretty bad need and Dave was also complaining but I said that I didn&#039;t feel the need.
I had been drinking as much water as they had during the course of the trip so they thought it was strange that I didn&#039;t have to…</p>
