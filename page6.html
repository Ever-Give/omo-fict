        <p class="card-text">The Motorway– or Why didn&#039;t She Ask to Stop? Part 1
Could there be anything worse on a coach outing? Joan wondered.
She was dying to go to the loo and did not know when she was going to be able to? It was one of those nightmare situations that she dreaded and always pretended would never happen to her. As she looked out of the coach window at the passing London suburbs, Joan tried to recognise where they were and wondered anxiously how much longer it would be before they stopped for a loo break.
In fact, although she did not want think about it, the real question was; how much longer she could wait until she absolutely had to get to a loo? She seemed to have been sitting for ever with her legs crossed,…</p>

        <p class="card-text">My job was assistant personal secretary to a senior manager. Actually I was a glorified messenger for much of the time. The manager liked to have an attractive girl to take his messages to clients or other departments in our bank. He insisted I was always smartly dressed, and I was happy to oblige him in this.
My chief attraction is my neat figure. Otherwise I am average in almost all areas. I have shoulder length brown to mousy hair. I am about average height, and would never win a beauty contest. I have always played a lot of tennis, squash and badminton, so I am slim and have what I think is a sexy little bottom. I also have a tiny bladder, which is more of an embarrassment than an asset, but I have…</p>

Her name was Debby. I have very good memories of her and from this period of my life. She was definitely a modern woman with modern thinking. In spite of the fact that she was almost twenty years older than me we became good friends and shared a lot of interests. She cared a lot about her appearance, always dressed in stylish clothes, suits with trousers or skirts and looked much younger.
On this particular Friday evening she came from work and quickly prepared for a company dinner. As might be expected for such occasion, she was in a suit with the…</p>

I had been expecting something challenging and unexpected to leap out at any point that first semester, but it never did. I relaxed a lot about my schoolwork then. I still did well, but allowed myself to have a social life as well.
I still wasn&#039;t a big house–party person. Those things are just annoying to me. A bunch of my friends were having a dorm party though, with one of those giant jugs of vodka and a couple of gallons of Tampico. I was pumped.
We all started drinking and playing Strip Monopoly, the rules of which still confuse me. I was wearing my college freshman…</p>

Carla looked into the mirror and smiled – her new date for tonight would be more than satisfied by her appearance tonight. Of course, they all were. Carla was that type of girl who made guys turn round their heads whenever she passed by – she had long black hair, a cute face, tanned, and wonderful figure (28 inch waist) and sexy ass. She never had any shortage of boyfriends, and this was something she reminded all of her girl mates, which was probably why she had very few girl friends.

Within his limits Dad was a good father. He made me work hard at school, he encouraged me to read widely, and he was always very patient answering my questions. But it was all in the world of the mind. The fact that his darling daughter had a bladder, bowels and a womb was something he could not really get his head round.
So the bodily aspects of my upbringing were all left to Mum. Sex was dealt with quite simply; it could be summed up in one sentence: &quot;Wait till you&#039;re married.&quot; Sometimes I seemed to pick up the implication…</p>

Felicia, a new servant girl of the castle, finished gulping down the contents of a tankard of ale. She shifted uncomfortably on the mahogany bench. Already the effects of the two previous tankards began to hit her bladder, and she knew that she&#039;d have to pee soon. Looking around the hall, she noticed a number of other servant girls also looking rather uncomfortable. For reasons she didn&#039;t know, the castle&#039;s lord always made sure his female servants drank a lot during feasts. Perhaps it was some odd kink he had, she didn&#039;t know.

Mandy looked at her reflection in the mirror for the umpteenth time that morning. She had to make sure that she looked perfect. It was an important day for her– she had to make sure she looked as attractive as possible. She was dressed in a tight white t–shirt with no bra, showing off her perfectly round breasts and erect nipples. She wore a tight denim skirt, short enough to reveal her light pink cotton panties when she bent over. She wished she was brave enough to wear her favourite pair of skinny jeans, but couldn&#039;t bring herself to risk the consequences of that just yet.

We were to spend the three team training days at a large hotel in the country, all expenses paid, and most of us were quite excited at the idea.

Honestly, I&#039;d rather slack at home for some sexy omorashi videos.
Before long, I reached the airport earlier than expected; I was anticipating a rain that might cause a traffic jam to occur at first, though the cloudy sky remained calm. I bought a Fillet O&#039; Fish from McDonald&#039;s and began eating mindlessly.…</p>

        <p class="card-text">The Seattle city center traffic was so bad that it was often joked that it caused people to become junkies and then kill themselves. It made sense as the city was famously known for being the center of the early 90’s grunge scene, a short–lived but significant era in rock music, with bands such as Nirvana, Alice in Chains, Pearl Jam, and Soundgarden. Two of the more influential grunge bands, Nirvana and Alice in Chains abruptly ended following the suicides of their lead singers in the mid 90’s.
Mandy, currently stuck in the same afternoon Seattle traffic, sighed deeply as her frustration mounted behind the wheel of her 2004 Volkswagen Golf. She was on her way home from work, a commute that was no more than 20…</p>

        <p class="card-text">It was a cold, wintry day, when Sarah woke up. It was still dark outside and the wind was blowing hard against the window. She immediately noticed her very bad need to pee. She was almost bursting. The need was so bad that she was actually frightened to move. She felt that any tiny movement might make her loose bladder control immediately.
She was laying there, in her nice, warm bed, with her comfy terrycloth pyjamas on, her heart hammering against her chest. &quot;I need to get up,&quot; she thought. &quot;I need to go to the bathroom, quickly!&quot; &quot;I can&#039;t move. I just can&#039;t, or I will pee the bed&quot; was the immediate afterthought.
Trembling, she was lying there, trying to make up the courage to try it. To make herself hold…</p>

I&#039;m sure phone sex has been around since shortly after Alexander Graham Bell invented the telephone. Certainly the proliferation of cell phones has increased phone sex activity exponentially, making this popular past time available to billions of people almost anywhere and anytime. 
But what about phone wetting? The desperation of someone at the other end of the call, trying to hold it and bursting for a pee, can be almost as exciting as seeing your favorite woman pee her pants. In fact, phone wetting can be more exciting than phone sex. Whereas phone sex, of necessity, must be staged by the parties at both ends of the call–…</p>

Rachel threw the last of her papers and other items into her briefcase and muttered &quot;Thank fuck for that!&quot; This was swiftly followed by &quot;Ow! Shit!&quot; as, slamming the lid shut, she trapped the fleshy part of the heel of her hand between the lid and the base. She sucked the wound ruefully; although she hadn&#039;t drawn blood, she expected that there would be a blood blister there later. God, what a day it had been; what a week, in fact. It had been all about stress, pressure, with a liberal helping of frustration thrown in for good measure; she was glad it was finally over, for the weekend, at least. But who knew what…</p>
