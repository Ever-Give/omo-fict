        <p class="card-text">James was so impressed by his trip dancing with Sue that he wanted to catch her performance on his video. The trip was planned as a day trip to the Isle of Wight. James and Sue set off at 6:00 a.m. to avoid traffic and spend the whole day. The trip to Portsmouth was fast and felt even faster as the conversation was fluid and easy. Sue was wearing a short red skirt and a white top and a little pair of pale pink string bikinis. Her long legs were tanned and very shapely and her white crop top complimented her little pert breasts. James bought Sue a nice white body shaper as a present and she put it on in the ladies’ room at a little restaurant in Salisbury where they stopped to replenish their tea supply. Sue…</p>

Last week I went Christmas shopping with my best friend Cathy and another girl from our course at University. We are all in 2nd year, Cathy went to high school with me and we have know each other for a number of years. We graduated high school like most girls I know with stretchy bladders as our school washrooms were totally gross! Cathy has the strongest bladder of any girl I know. She is the only person I know who can get up in the morning and go to a full morning&#039;s classes without going pee. She just gets up brushes her teeth, showers has breakfast with at least two cups of tea ,that would right there have my legs crossed! Then she goes to class and has another drink at mid morning. She…</p>

As you will know from reading my last story &quot;Christmas Shopping&quot;, my friend Cathy and I like to hold it. Not only do we like to hold our bladders which I am good at and Cathy is a professional at doing but, we like to get other unsuspecting girls to have to hold it too!! I believe holding is just a matter of knowing above all that your bladder can expand to accommodate the amount of piss that you need to put in it! Accidents are likewise a lack of confidence and the panic causes the loss of control more than lack of muscle tone. How many girls can hold it till they are just getting their panties down or just about there?? I know that they could manage those crucial seconds and get away…</p>
