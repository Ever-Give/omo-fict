        <p class="card-text">There was no doubt in the collective minds of any of Kristi&#039;s family. The tall blonde eighteen year old could pee. Not pee in the conventional average normal definition of the word. No, her urinations could easily take on superhuman characteristics in the early morning hours of dawn. The incessant endless splattering of her urine acted as an alarm clock for her two sisters and her mother still in their beds. Her characteristic interval pee–pause, pee and pause would drone on and on, until at last the very unrelenting unceasing nature of it would finally rouse the other three who would file into the bathroom shaking their heads.
As Kristi blossomed into young womanhood, puberty seemed to of had the…</p>

        <p class="card-text">This is an incident that happened a long time ago when my husband (Bill) and I were just starting to date. It was a warm day in June and Bill picked me up for a long drive in the country. We were driving aimlessly around near Hartford, CT trying to decide where to go when Bill said: &quot;Let&#039;s drive up to Massachusetts and visit my sister.&quot; Nothing unusual happened on the long 2–hour ride to MA. We stopped and picked up some beer and a bottle of wine and arrived late in the afternoon.
When we arrived, I needed to pee but not very bad; I just had to squeeze my pee hole muscles a little tighter to keep from dribbling in my panties. Bill&#039;s sister lived alone in a 1–bedroom bungalow on the outskirts of town. She was…</p>

        <p class="card-text">I began plotting ways to get my girlfriends into situations where they were at the brink with no restroom at their disposal. I know that sounds evil, but it has become such a turn on for me. A couple of weeks back one of my plans worked out better than I had thought it would. It all started one week when a girlfriend of mine from work, Pam, asked what I was doing over the weekend. I replied that I had not much in mind but suggested that maybe we could catch a movie or something. She sounded interested and asked me to call her with plans. A couple of days later I scanned the movie listings and saw that Lord of the Rings was playing. This grabbed my interest because my friends had seen it and told me that it was…</p>

JANE&#039;S REVENGE Jane and her mum were staying with her aunt and her daughter Katie for a short holiday. Jane had arrived suffering from a bladder complaint that left her with feeble control of her bladder and inclined toward having accidents. Her embarrassing state would be made worse if any sexual stimulation were indulged in; as it inevitably delayed the time it would take for the complaint to get better. Unfortunately, the medication that Jane was taking had a side effect that caused such vaginal irritation it drove Jane to near nymphomania. To make matters worse, the doctor had Jane fitted with a panty girdle that acted like a chastity belt, to prevent scratching…</p>

The pleated mini skirt showed her legs to good advantage, together with the black sheer stockings held in place with a matching frilly suspender belt, black patent leather shoes. She felt confident that he would be impressed with her appearance. Jill was aware of Ian&#039;s predilection regarding water sports, and knicker wetting. In fact it was she who, in the earlier stages of their relationship, could be credited with his induction into the delights of wet love. The last time he had talked to her was only last night.

It was a very... hmm... for lack of better words, interesting afternoon. Really, such a shame that you left as soon as you did. I guess I was a bit bored after you left seeing as I was all alone in an empty house. Since there was nothing better to do I went through some old clothes and was pleasantly surprised to find a long lost pair of light tan corduroy pants. I tried them on to see if they still fit, and to an extent they did... Yes I could get them all zipped and buttoned, but the zipper and button fit snug right over my bladder. Then I got just a horrid little…</p>

Without hesitation she reached for me under the sheets, and even half asleep I reacted immediately. I slid my hands up her thighs and encountered a soaking wet crotch under her dress. She turned me over on my back – Bridget is a big, strong girl – and slid her dress over her hips. With one hand she tore her tights and panties down to her knees and sank down on me. She held her belly while she moved intensely, sighed, moaned, and came more quickly than she had ever done before. Before I even came close she slid off and ran to the bathroom. It all happened so…</p>

The long, reddish–brown hair fell softly over her shoulders, reaching almost to the strap that was showing clearly under the tight red t–shirt. Time and again Vicky had to brush her hair from her face. After a while it fell back again, prompting another touch of her cheek. Gail ruffled her short curls and wished she had longer hair. Better keep writing. Final exam. She knew too little about agricultural policy, but had settled for that after discarding drug rehabilitation and unemployment. She could never write about homosexual rights, not ever. Vicky had tired of the unruly hair, putting it up high in a ponytail with a red elastic band. Gail found herself staring…</p>

        <p class="card-text">One day my husband (Don) and I were moving some furniture into a storage shed. When I had to pee, I realized that there were no toilets nearby. At first I crossed my legs when I had a chance and squeezed my pussy muscles real tight to keep from peeing in my panties. Crossing my legs helps me hold my pee if I don&#039;t have to go too bad but when I am desperate to pee I have to put pressure on my pussy.

When she called we discussed our options for that next week. With everything being so hectic on the airlines these days we opted to drive home this holiday. So, on that day we were to drive home together April was actually running late. She lives an hour south of me these days and made the trip to my apartment that morning. By the time she arrived I was anxious to get on the road. She didn&#039;t need the restroom or anything so we got right in my Jeep and we were off.
