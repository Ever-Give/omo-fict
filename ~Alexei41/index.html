        <p class="card-text">Most of this story is true. The main part of it (the desperation and wetting) was emailed to me by a very close girl friend in the USA, last year for Valentine&#039;s day. I asked her if she would mind if I made it into a story, and post it, and she said she would be delighted. I wrote a story round it, and made it the second episode in my &quot;Linda&#039;s accidents&quot; series. (I posted the first one on here not so long ago) The clothes she was wearing, the desperation and the wetting is 100% true – I&#039;ve just altered the location, and some of the other details. The girl Linda is fictitious, of course, as I wouldn&#039;t dream of disclosing the real girl&#039;s name.

        <p class="card-text">Linda stood at the bus stop, her thighs pressed tightly together. She wished that she had been for a wee–wee before she finished work, but she was too busy chatting to her friend, and before she knew it, it was time to dash out for her bus. She had held it all afternoon, being too busy to go to the toilet, but she hadn&#039;t drunk much coffee that day, so her need to wee had not been too pressing.
Now, however, she was desperate, and her bus was due any second. She didn&#039;t think that she could hold on till she got home. She was tempted to let some of her wee go now, but there was a man standing at the bus stop, and she didn&#039;t want to wee in front of him.
