This is a true f/f event 
After we had shopped ourselves out around the boutiques of Bristol, we sat in a coffee shop to talk. I was inquisitive as to whether or not Fiona was really into watersports, or it had just been a way for her now obvious lesbian tendencies to manifest themselves when we had been in the toilet cubicle. She told me that she had been wetting herself for about two and a half years, ever since she had not reached a toilet in time, and she had enjoyed the experience. When I explained to her, that in addition to enjoying the feeling of being wet, that I also liked wearing a nappy and plastic or rubber pants, Fiona was intrigued. She wanted to know when and where I…</p>

        <p class="card-text">I have been peeing for ten years, but only by myself at home. This is the first time I have had the experience of playing with anyone else.
Fiona arrived at my house at 7am for the 100–mile drive to Bristol for the shopping expedition that we had planned.
