I take the dress off the hanger and brush my hand across the smooth, shimmering ruby–red fabric. The anticipation already sends little sparks of pleasure through my mind and body. I feel the tips of my nipples harden slightly and a warm sensation passes over my breasts and between my thighs. Stepping into the dress and slowly pulling it up and over my legs, watching in the mirror as it climbs over my thighs and hips. The sheer light tan tights and white satin high–leg briefs I&#039;ve chosen are slowly covered by the sheer red body of my outfit and I finish running the dress over my bare chest, already cupping and gathering my breasts…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Another major accident that I&#039;ve had more recently took place whilst backpacking in Australia a couple of years ago. Traveling sometimes gets you into some pretty desperate situations, but this one probably takes the prize for idiot wetting.
I had been working and traveling for about 7 months when a group of us headed up from our hostel in Brisbane to Bundaberg. This bit of Queensland is a major fruit and vegetable growing area and there is always a ton of work on the farms for skint travelers. There&#039;s a whole industry based on providing hostels for farm workers and getting them to and from jobs. But it&#039;s REALLY hard and shitty work and some of the farmers and supervisors are total mentalists. Want to…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Any of you who work in construction will know that, occasionally, a zip–tight bladder is pretty much essential. Whilst I was at university (on my year placement) I really learned the hard way! It wasn&#039;t the first time I&#039;d wet my knickers – either in public or privately ;–) – but doing it at work was never top of my list!
I was working with a firm of architects and was asked to go and do some survey drawings at an English cathedral. This involved going up into the roof space and then climbing down onto scaffolding about 25 meters above–ground on the outside of the building. I love this kind of stuff about my job and was really chuffed when the practice manager said I could handle the work myself.
