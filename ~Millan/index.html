        <p class="card-text">This is a follow–up of Millan&#039;s previous story that you can find here: Scaring Myself I woke up kind of early and something felt weird. I had been dreaming about what I was going to spend the day doing, and I already had two ideas that I didn&#039;t have time for yesterday. I yawned and stretched a bit; still terribly sleepy it took a while for me to notice what was feeling so odd&#039;As I turned over I felt the plastic cover against me and I noticed that I was peeing. That&#039;s why I woke up! I was wetting the bed! It had never happened to me before, and I guess the constant bladder torturing the day before was the cause. Actually it was nothing more than a drop before I woke up but I would like to call it a bed wetting…</p>

This is another real life experience from me, about what I did right after my previous story, &quot;The camouflaged wetting&quot; =)
I had tortured my bladder two times today already, and I didn&#039;t know how much more it could handle. After stepping out of the shower where I cleaned up after trying my camouflage kit out, I needed to pee really often, like every 30–40 minutes, even though it wasn&#039;t much. My bladder was very weak, but I still had the evening and night for further experiments. Now that I had found this new interest, I couldn&#039;t let any opportunity go to waste. I was hoping that if I didn&#039;t torture my bladder at…</p>

This is another real life experience from me :)
When I had finished cleaning up after my first accident, I was still pretty confused... I mean, I&#039;m not supposed to wet my pants when I&#039;m almost 20 years, how could such an odd thing be the best turn–on ever? I still haven&#039;t figured that one out, but I stopped bothering. It&#039;s the best feeling ever, I don&#039;t care if I can&#039;t explain it as long as I love it!
Anyway, I had two full days alone still, and it&#039;s not often I get the opportunity to be alone like this. Also, with school over for the week and no particular homework I needed to care about, I had nothing to do…</p>

        <p class="card-text">I have been interested in wetting for quite some time, been watching all kinds of sites on the Internet where girls wet themselves, and really enjoyed it a lot. I don&#039;t know how or when it started, I&#039;ve seen some girls showing signs of desperation every now and then when I&#039;m out, so I guess that&#039;s what triggered it for me. But I had never even considered doing it myself, until one lucky day when it just happened. (English is not my first language, I&#039;m sorry for any spelling mistakes or incorrect words that might appear in the text, but I hope you will get what I mean anyway.)
Since this is my first story I&#039;m posting, I thought that I&#039;d start with trying to describe how I look– from my experience most people…</p>
