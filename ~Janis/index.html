        <p class="card-text">The next few days went by rather uneventfully. Neither Carol nor I wanted to make a mistake in our relationship, so we were very, very cautious. In fact, aside from the fact that we continued to sleep in the same bed, our relationship went back to what it had been in the past. I had arrived on Saturday evening and all the big revelations had taken place before midnight Sunday.
While it was uneventful in terms of any wetting together or other sex play, we did get around a bit. We went swimming in Lake Coeur d&#039;Alene, borrowed a friend&#039;s sailboat for a day, spent one whole day shopping and Carol tried to teach me how to play golf – sorry, but that&#039;s just not going to happen! Through it all there was, for me at…</p>

        <p class="card-text">I went shopping today. I don&#039;t do that real often, at least not the cruise–the–mall, visit–every–store kind of shopping. But today I needed to buy some clothes so I found myself in a mall. There was a sale going on and I wanted to get a couple of blouses and a skirt that had been advertised, so I first went to get them, but when I got to the car with my purchases I decided there was no reason to head for home and I might as well take a wander around.
I must have spent an hour or so wandering up and down the mall, checking out different stores and finally stopping to get a cup of coffee. For a while I just sat and watched the people go by, wondering about their stories and making up stories to go with their…</p>

I did something new last night. I&#039;ve been reading the stories on this site for about a year and enjoying them and some of the pictures. What I&#039;ve most enjoyed is the knowledge that there are other people out there who enjoy the same sort of thing that I do. I thank you all for being there and helping me enjoy being the person who I am. But about last night...
I enjoy wetting myself. If you&#039;ve been reading my stories from last summer that should be pretty obvious. I&#039;ve been wetting my panties for several years and discovered the thrill of actually wetting my pants last summer. I can hardly get enough of that feeling when I first start to let it go, when I can&#039;t quite tell if I&#039;m getting wet or…</p>

        <p class="card-text">There was a bit of a delay getting this third part out to you all. I thought I had sent it just a couple days after part two, but I think I suffered a bit of an organizational breakdown. At any rate it never got sent, but here it is now, better late than never. I hope you all are enjoying reading this– it has gotten longer than I thought it would. At first I thought two parts would take care of it, but it is really a lot of fun to write about, so I&#039;m including all the detail I can remember. I&#039;ve decided to put my e–mail address on this one just so I can hear how you all like my story. You can write me using the link at the bottom of this page.

        <p class="card-text">This is part two of my story. I almost didn&#039;t send it in. After reading my first installment on the Web I sort of panicked, I was afraid that someone could figure out whom I really am and that it might cause problems for me. I was also a bit embarrassed to read such intimate details about my life on a forum that basically anyone with a computer could read. Strangely enough, it was Carol who persuaded me to send in this next part. She read the first one after I told her it was going to be posted and wanted to read the rest of my impressions of that week. Now that some time has gone by and I&#039;ve thought about it I think it would be pretty hard for someone to track me down, and even if it is embarrassing at times…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Hi. This is a personal account of some of what is going on in my life right now. I only recently discovered that I wasn&#039;t the only person in the world who enjoyed wetting my pants, so the stories here have been a real revelation to me. After reading a bunch of them I decided to write about my own experiences, I hope you like them. This story is mostly true– I just changed enough details to make it pretty hard for someone to actually find me. I&#039;m not going to publish my e–mail right now, maybe with a later installment. Enjoy! I sure enjoyed writing it – almost as much as I enjoyed doing it when it happened. –– Janis
