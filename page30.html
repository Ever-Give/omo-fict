        <p class="card-text">I work in a real estate office and I get to meet and interact with all kinds of great folks. Having spent all my life in the retail business both working with and watching people, I&#039;ve learned how to feed my fetishes by setting up scenarios without the players knowing what&#039;s going on. I know it&#039;s devious but I can&#039;t help myself as they just sort of fall into the act. Sometimes this talent comes in handy when you have some of the fetishes we all seem to enjoy.
We often hold public open houses where we will open up a home and let the public tour it. It gives us the chance to meet new buyers and to help market a property we have listed. Sometimes those listed properties are new homes that have been built in…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Blair was grocery shopping for the big party she was having the next day. All she could think about as she walked down the aisles was the huge amount of fun she would have with all of her girlfriends. Unfortunately, she had gotten so caught up in everything she was doing at home that she had forgotten to go to the grocery store until the very last minute.
&quot;I hope I can manage to get there before it closes&quot; –she thought to herself.
It was still open, but it was only 20 minutes from closing time. As she hurriedly made her way down the aisles, she was distracted by something going on in the back room. It sounded like an employee was getting fired, or at least yelled at a whole lot. So she hid behind a display…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Forty–five years ago I had an Uncle Ron and an Auntie Pam. Except that they weren&#039;t really an aunt and uncle – Ron was a long–term work colleague of my father and they met socially outside the office. I had called them aunt and uncle since a small boy and they treated me like the nephew they didn&#039;t have, with gifts at Christmas and birthdays and chocolate eggs at Easter.
Uncle Ron and Auntie Pam seemed to be quite well off by 1950&#039;s standards and owned an Austin A35 – a very small motorcar that preceded the internationally famous &#039;mini&#039;. We lived in a flat (what might now be called an apartment) in London and several times a year my father and I would accompany them on trips to the country. My mother hated…</p>

A few years ago, I was on a bus traveling across Australia on my gap year. I was sitting right at the back in the window seat and a pretty, blonde girl was sitting on the opposite side. The desert had been rolling by for hours and I hadn&#039;t really taken much notice of her. But then I noticed she was beginning to fidget. She was trying to read a map, jiggling the whole time. After a minute she turned to me, leaned over the empty seats and said. &quot;Excuse me, do you know how much further we&#039;ve got to go?&quot;
I looked at my watch. &quot;About 2 hours.&quot;
She smiled and thanked me and sat back in her seat. But she couldn&#039;t sit still. She stared out of…</p>

I was sure I was still drunk after all the rum I drank, but I still had 9 hours before anyone got home. It is not very often I get the house to myself so I decided to use it to the fullest. I drank more rum, but kept it slow. I wanted to stay in the joyous state I was in. I wondered what naughty thing was left to do. Then it came to me; what was more arousing than smoking? I had taken a few puffs before with friends, but had never smoked a whole cigarette before. I imagined peeing, masturbating, and smoking. What more could I want?

Then to make matters worse, the strong winds had caused the snow to drift. Although the snow ploughs had made the main roads passable, the remainder of the thoroughfares were blocked to cars, even off–road vehicles. Ian, my husband, had dug paths along with the neighbors, so people could walk. But the nearest town was 6 miles away.
After a lot of thought we decided on a plan of action, the nearest main road was one and a half miles across the fields. We decided to make a fun thing out of it and walk to the main road, then phone for a taxi.
Then all dressed up in sweaters, wind…</p>

        <p class="card-text">In my previous story, I explained how I had my first–ever real accident when I was incredibly desperate and sneezed. I had decided to &quot;hold it&quot; on purpose, and had become so desperate that when I sneezed, I peed my pants.
But although I didn&#039;t really enjoy peeing my pants, I really liked the feeling of being desperate, so I decided to do it again.
About a month after the incident described above, I once again found myself needing the toilet during our first fifteen–minute break period, and denying myself that relief because I wanted to be desperate again. I&#039;ve found that having a full bladder is extremely pleasurable for me, and I often put off going to the toilet for long periods so that I can experience…</p>

        <p class="card-text">This is part two of my story. I almost didn&#039;t send it in. After reading my first installment on the Web I sort of panicked, I was afraid that someone could figure out whom I really am and that it might cause problems for me. I was also a bit embarrassed to read such intimate details about my life on a forum that basically anyone with a computer could read. Strangely enough, it was Carol who persuaded me to send in this next part. She read the first one after I told her it was going to be posted and wanted to read the rest of my impressions of that week. Now that some time has gone by and I&#039;ve thought about it I think it would be pretty hard for someone to track me down, and even if it is embarrassing at times…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Tyler gazed around at the sparkling surface of the water of the crowded swimming pool. So many people seemed to have the same idea as him. It was a hot summer day, near the end of July and all of Tyler&#039;s buds had deserted him for their summer jobs. Bored and full of pent–up desires (solitary masturbation just isn&#039;t enough), Tyler donned a hot pair of swim trunks under his clothes, and headed over to the local pool. He was keen on all those dripping, scantily clothed females. Oh, how he envied the male lifeguards that worked there.
He scanned the edge of the pool, looking for a friendly face. Seeing no one he recognized, he then turned his focus to the vacant poolside lounge chairs. He finally spotted an empty…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Siobhan was a rugby fan, so when she was working in the English West–country she was a regular at the local club games. As a colored Australian girl with a flamboyant, if not provocative, style of dressing, she attracted plenty of attention, and it was not long before she had one of the players as a boyfriend. This got her free admission to the best seats in the ground and into the club bar, but her skin tight jeans or short skirts, coupled with her openly partisan support of Australia over England meant that she was not universally welcomed. The wives of some of the older and more conservative members were particularly disapproving; not that Siobhan cared one bit. She dismissed them as a bunch of fat–arsed,…</p>
