        <p class="card-text">Parker wasn&#039;t in the school marching band –– he couldn&#039;t have kept step if he wanted to, which he didn&#039;t –– but he often hung out with band kids. When the band director asked his musicians if they knew anyone who could use a video camera well to film their practices and performances, Parker&#039;s name came up, and as such he was roped into being the band&#039;s AV guy. He didn&#039;t mind; it meant he could spend time with his band buddies, and while he wasn&#039;t getting paid, the band director always had free food for him, and that was pretty awesome. Plus, Parker was thinking about being a movie cameraman, or somehow work in films, so it was great experience. Last but not least, it meant he soon got the job of filming the…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Samantha stood at the supermarket checkout regretting her decision to do her shopping before going to the toilet. She found herself hopping uncomfortably from foot to foot as her goods were scanned and she packed the shopping into bags. And it didn&#039;t help that the scanner wouldn&#039;t read one of the items, and so the checkout girl had to call the supervisor to sort it out. It was all adding to the time spent waiting, time Samantha was rapidly realising she didn&#039;t have. As she paid and loaded the last of the bags into her trolley she felt a small dribble of pee escape into her knickers. She thought to herself how lucky it was she was wearing a skirt and not jeans. She rushed to her car trying desperately to hold…</p>

Aunt May was always happy to put up anyone who dropped in, whether they were expected or not, so I decided to surprise her and turn up unannounced. I arrived about 7pm on Friday evening, knocked the door, walked in and shouted &quot;Hi!&quot;
I was a little surprised when a young female voice shouted back, &quot;Who&#039;s that?&quot; I walked into the lounge and saw that Jenny and Jilly were sitting on the sofa with no sign of Aunt May. Jenny and Jilly were identical twins that lived across the road from Aunt May. They were about 23 years old and were absolutely gorgeous. &quot;Oh, Hi Gord,&quot; said Jilly, &quot;Your…</p>

        <p class="card-text">My name is Patience and my twin sister is called Prudence. They&#039;re rather old–fashioned names; they came from a 1950s singing duo that my grandmother was very fond of. Usually we abbreviate them to &quot;Prue&quot; and &quot;Paish&quot;. But in one very important aspect of our lives – our toilet habits – they turned out to be prophetic.
Prudence and I look very similar – tall, dark hair, nice figures and legs, and we tend to have similar attitudes and interests. We even go for the same type of boyfriends. But on the all–important question of emptying our bladders, we are very different.
We live with our Mum in North London. And since she gets a bit of criticism in this story, let me just say she has been a wonderful Mum. Dad…</p>

She had been humiliated by being forced to pee in her clothes in front of me, an accident I was responsible for, albeit indirectly. Now that she&#039;d had time to think things over, I felt sure she would decide to tender her resignation and move on, rather than having to face the awkwardness of working alongside me.
It had been good while it lasted, I told myself. She had asked for a shot at the job, despite the difficulties created by the lack of female facilities, but things had gone hopelessly wrong on her very first day. I didn&#039;t see how she could deal with the embarrassment.…</p>

Carlee was 23–years–old, fresh out of university and working towards a career in municipal government. She thought that starting out with a first job as a meter reader would enable her to get real–world experience in local government as well as helping her keep fit. At the same time, she also thought that this job would allow her to indulge in her fetish of desperation and panty wetting, without anyone knowing.

It was about an hour and a half after sunup and a bus from the nearest town had just dropped off a passenger that was one of the most beautiful African–American girls I had ever seen. She was standing in the large driveway that served the restaurant where I had the occasion to dine that morning so I got a close up view of her.
And, from her intense watching of the road that crossed the main thoroughfare I assumed that she was waiting for a ride, probably to her home. She had probably worked the midnight shift at one of the mills in town and had…</p>

The contracts for the publisher&#039;s authors for the next year had to go out today so they could be filed in time. Otherwise the company would lose money on its contracts, and Rachel would lose her job.
She was also cursing everything she&#039;d had to drink today. Her bladder was being stretched beyond limits holding the remains of all the cups of coffee and her giant soda from lunch. Rachel had been so busy thrashing on her contracts she hadn&#039;t noticed a need to visit the bathroom, but now she was at the point her bladder could be…</p>

        <p class="card-text">About a week ago, my girlfriend Jenny and I decided to go to a small–town outdoor country music festival. The way it was advertised was that music would be going all day and well into the night, with vendors selling food, arts &amp; crafts, and the like. Jenny and I are both into country music, and are kind of the outdoorsy types.
I fell in love with this girl a couple years ago when we were seniors in high school. We had flirted around for a couple of months when a mutual friend finally hooked us up. I couldn&#039;t believe my luck that this slender, athletic blonde country girl wanted to hook up with me.
It only took us a few months to get intimate– at our senior prom, no less, and we soon found out how sexually…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Kelli stood outside her sister&#039;s doorway, piss still dripping from the panties her older sister was recently wearing, her red hair laying down over her shoulders and green eyes almost shimmering. Kelli giggled slightly.
Allie stood in her room; blushing so hard you could see it through her brown hair that cluttered her face. Kelli walked away, making sure the dark blue panties were a little bit up her ass for her sister to see, as she walked into her room. Allie stood there, knowing that Kelli had something planned from the glimmer in her eye. She cautiously walked over to her sister&#039;s door, which was open, but was dark inside. She stood there, looking in the room for Kelli, but couldn&#039;t find her. She…</p>

        <p class="card-text">I have to admit there have been times that I have enjoyed the feeling of desperation or wondered what it was like to have an accident at this age, but I wasn&#039;t prepared for what happened to me one day out in public.
Since I was starting college in a few weeks, my stepmom agreed to come with me for some nice back to school clothes. Usually when I know I am going to try on lots of clothes, I wear things that are easy to get on and off repeatedly. However, today I wanted to wear one of the new outfits I had just bought for school, which was a cute longer tunic and short skirt with ribbed tights underneath. Since we were going to be gone a good portion of the day, I had a big breakfast including two cups of juice…</p>
