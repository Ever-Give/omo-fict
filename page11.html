        <p class="card-text">It was 7:15 in the morning and Gabrielle Baker was going to be late for class. She had forgotten to set her alarm clock the night before and awoke to the sound of her mother banging on her bedroom door. The high school senior barely had the time to grab her books, let alone do anything else before she had to be out the door. She had far too many absences this semester and was dangerously close to not graduating if she missed any more classes. In her haste she threw on a black baby doll tee that was lying on her floor with a black bikini top underneath. She quickly jumped into a pair of extra short denim shorts, while keeping on the white cotton panties she had worn to bed. Gabrielle grabbed her keys, slipped…</p>

        <p class="card-text">I had known Alice&#039;s secret for almost two weeks by now, and I still did not know what to do!
I was working in a PC repair shop as a summer holiday job. After doing any hardware repairs, we would regularly scan the PC&#039;s for viruses and other dodgy software. Of course, we found all sorts of other things on people&#039;s hard disks, but unless it was illegal, we never even mentioned it to the customer. Of course, if anything illegal had turned up, it would have gone straight to the police – but that left a lot of other interesting things!
This particular customer, called Alice, had brought her PC in because it was freezing every few minutes. Alice said her PC contained her university work, and she was quite…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Lauren had let it go too far this time. She was nearly bursting and there was such a long way to go...
Today had been the concert that she and Jason had been waiting for, and an awesome concert it turned out to be, with one of the greatest rock bands of all time on their recent tour. Lauren had had 2 large cokes, as well as some of Jason&#039;s water, and was now regretting many of her other decisions of the day as well. For one, she absolutely refused to use the porta potties at the concert, and now that they were sitting in the parking lot, waiting for the line of cars to move, she knew it would be a very long ride home. The ride was set to be nearly an hour back to her house, and even more if they went to Jason…</p>

        <p class="card-text">I pulled up to the address on my work ticket, and went to the door and knocked. She opened the door. &#039;Wow,&#039; I thought to myself. She was wearing a pair of tight denim shorts over black shiny hose. Her red top was tight on her body, and showed her full female form. She looked great at that moment. But she had a bounce to her step, like she was agitated about something. 
I asked her where the air conditioner was so I could start my task and distract myself from her tightly wrapped body. She told me she would show me what I needed in a minute. She offered me a glass of water and I accepted, and she poured herself one too. When she thought I couldn&#039;t see her, I saw her cross her legs a bit, and shoot a hand to…</p>

When I got home after college Eve and Ann were waiting for me in the living room. They had put a blanket on the floor and told me I had to stand on it while I peed my jeans. I felt so turned on. I had just come home, with my coat and backpack still on and I could wet my pants now. I didn&#039;t hesitate, without taking anything off I stepped on the blanket and slightly spread my legs. Ann said something like, &#039;Oh my God, she is going to do it completely dressed, with even her backpack on,&#039; and then I relaxed. I felt it coming soon enough. It erupted against my panties, making it jet back at…</p>

I don&#039;t know how or when it started, I&#039;ve seen some girls showing signs of desperation every now and then when I&#039;m out, so I guess that&#039;s what triggered it for me. But I had never even considered doing it myself, until one lucky day when it just happened.

Maria Zellar is a thin girl, very geeky, but also quite attractive at the age of eighteen. Her dark, brown hair contrasts her pale skin very nicely, and her glasses compliment her face. She also has very large breasts for someone so thin.
Today Maria&#039;s senior class was on a field trip to the Natural History Museum. Her class had arrived in town at around 11:00am, and it was now 3:50. It was nearing time to leave, but Maria didn&#039;t even notice because she was so enthralled by the exhibits.

At work we have a strict policy. You can surf and mail work related and mail privately as well if it doesn&#039;t take up to much work time. Porn is strictly forbidden. As head of the IT department I had to check this from time to time. All Internet pages visited were logged on both who visited and how long they stayed if they were not in the approved list. I checked the log twice a week and if a site was clearly work related I added it to the list immediately. If it was on the edge of work related but not in violation of work codes (porn) I added it to a second list where the maximum visit…</p>

The next day my parents were going to a wine shop to get estimates on the worth of the wine. They were going with my grandparents and were planning on making a day out of it. I stayed behind and went into the secret area. When I was in the cellar I heard the doorbell and it was Monica. I opened the door from the inside and told her to come in through my living room. When she was with me she asked me why I wanted her to come in that way. I told her I didn&#039;t want anyone to find out about this secret place, so as few doors as we needed had to be used. The only door that opened inwards was my room; the…</p>

        <p class="card-text">As the three women were lying in the sun after their lunch, a girl came riding along on her bicycle. With her long, shiny hair, her slender and athletic but well–rounded figure, and her –as usual – fashionable style of dress she was the siren boys might die for. She was living in the next village and not especially fond of Marianne, although she knew the girl liked her. At present, she was disappointed to see the group of women here, where she had thought to take a quick pee break in the bunker. She knew about the vagabond living there and as she did not like vagabonds she wanted to annoy him by peeing into his treasured home. She was relieved to see the three women were almost asleep and as it seemed, naked.…</p>

Michaela jolted up in bed as her deafening alarm clock started to beep. She quickly silenced the alarm and rubbed her eyes, it was a little past 4 pm and she was supposed to meet her roommate Alyssa for a late lunch down the street. The two girls worked together as bartenders at a trendy nightclub nearby. Michaela didn&#039;t get home until 6 am that morning but tonight was the beginning of their weekend and she intended to put it to good use. Michaela crawled out from under the covers revealing her smooth tan legs, She was about 5&#039;&quot;7&quot; and weighed around 108. She ran her fingers through her shoulder length…</p>

        <p class="card-text">I was in a huge hotel complex. In every direction I could see long corridors stretching away; there were bars, restaurants, foyers, lobbies. I could see everything but the one thing I needed – a Ladies&#039; room. And did I need it badly! I was aching with desperation. Surely there must be dozens of toilets in a building like this. I tried asking people as they bustled past me, obviously on their way to urgent appointments. But nobody seemed to speak English. I was getting frantic. But there was no sign of a toilet anywhere. What could I do? At last I caught sight of a sign, at the far end of a long corridor. But as I made my way as quickly as I could, already anticipating blissful relief, alarm bells began to ring…</p>

Sophie&#039;s bladder throbbed insistently. She ignored it and took another pull on her glass of Chablis. Sophie had other, more pressing matters on her mind, such as her hard earned career crashing to the ground. All her efforts destroyed in an instant, and all because of one damn picture. The image flashed back into her mind again as she squirmed slightly in her chair. All those frills, all that lace, and those two shiny stilettos with that huge ... Sophie again tilted the glass, but the image in her head could not be banished.

        <p class="card-text">It all started for me when I moved with my parents to the town my mother grew up in. We went living next to my uncle and aunt, but more importantly my niece Caroline. It was the beginning of the summer–vacation when we moved, so my parents had time to settle down in the new house before they had to start working again. This gave me the time to get to know the town a bit better and to make some friends before school started. Caroline showed me around and introduced me to some of her friends. We spent a lot of time together and grew quite close. One day we decided to go to the beach together, well beach is a somehow big word. It was a river with a bit of sand on the shores. The best spot happened to be behind…</p>
