        <p class="card-text">&quot;Sir, could you please put your seat in the upright position?&quot;
&quot;What? Oh yeah, sorry. I must have fallen asleep,&quot; I say and automatically obey the flight attendant by releasing the seat forward. Immediately, my full bladder announces that it must be emptied.
I have been on this six–hour flight and have been assigned to the window seat, which was usually my favorite place to sit. But this time the man in the isle seat next to me has the longest legs I have ever seen.
