        <p class="card-text">Last weekend my wife and I attended a wedding here in Phoenix. It is getting a little warm so the ceremony was held outside. The wedding was to take place at 2 p.m. so we got there about 1p.m. There was a tent set up for the guests to drop off gifts and to get a glass of punch, etc. My wife was quite thirsty and started drinking punch and had 2 or 3 glasses within the first 10 minutes. She continued to sip until the ushers began to seat us. She mentioned she should have visited the restroom but did not have time to do so. After about 15 minutes into the ceremony she started to fidget and cross her legs tightly. I noticed her hand wander to the area just below her waist and press firmly.

        <p class="card-text">This is a true story that just occurred this weekend. ( february 20, 2000 )
My wife and I have been enjoying her peeing activities for quite a few years. At first she wasn&#039;t comfortable with the idea of wetting herself. After a few years of gentle persuasion and a few genuine accidents she finally would wet herself, but only if I asked. Actually this was working out O.K. All I had to do lately was to ask her if she wouldn&#039;t mind wetting her panties at work, home or wherever and she would do so. She actually wet herself at work without asking quite a few times. She developed a pattern of wetting while waiting at the Xerox machine. She almost always wears a skirt so she was O.K. with it as long as it didn&#039;t …</p>
