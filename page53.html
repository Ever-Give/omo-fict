        <p class="card-text">Hey, all! I go to Texas A&amp;M and last night was our first viewing session in Film Studies. We were watching Gone With the Wind, which is about 4hrs long. Anyway, the professor asked that none of us leave our seats and disturb the class. About 3 hrs into it I noticed that two girls in front of me had started whispering to each other. One told the other that she &quot;had to pee so bad&quot;. Finally something interesting!! From that point on I could not tell you how the movie went, as I was too busy watching this girl. There was a large amount of weight shifting and leg twisting going on. With about 15 minutes left in the movie, I noticed that this girl started whimpering very quietly and I could see tears glinting on her…</p>

        <p class="card-text">I&#039;m a woman who gets very aroused by the sight of another girl or woman who is desperate to pee. Maybe that&#039;s because I love to pee and I love to hold my pee. I work in an office and I often hold off going to pee as long as I can. This has caused me to squirt pee into my panties on several occasions.
I nearly always wear dresses or skirts to work and no one can see me when I&#039;m behind my desk. I sometimes sit at my desk put my hand under my skirt and play with my pussy thru my panties. It feels so good to press my hand up against my pussy when I have to pee and the more I have to pee the better it feels. 
I also play other solo pee games at work but I&#039;ll save them for later because I want to talk about…</p>

A couple of months back I was joining one of my neighbors in celebrating her birthday. She had planned to have a limo take a bunch of us into the city to go to a club. Sounded fine to me. It was a horrible night out weather wise though. It had been pouring rain since early in the afternoon and showed no signs of slowing. 
The bunch of us included two other guys, five girls, all of who were very attractive, I must say, and myself. So off we headed, the city was about half an hour from our apartments. The drive on this night was taking a bit longer due to the heavy rain. On our way there I noticed some…</p>

All the coke she had at lunch was now anxious to leave her body and her bladder was filled to the max. She squeezed her thighs together and tried to ignore the pressure between her legs and pay attention to the professor instead. She glanced up at the clock on the wall – 30 more minutes until this class was due to get out. She hoped the lesson would be short and the professor would let the class out early.
Mother Nature was offering no assistance as a heavy rain fell steadily outside the window to her right. The constant sound of rain on the roof and splashing…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Yesterday we had a night ski trip to a small ski resort with just one slope. We had a little race scheduled for 7, and due to heavy traffic, we didn&#039;t get there until 10 minutes prior to start. There were about 20 people in our group. There was heavy drinking going on during the bus ride, and right when we finally got there, several of the guys went straight out and peed in the snow. When I got out of the bus, I could see three girls starting to walk down to the little town to search for a bathroom, as I had hoped. But our leader shouted after them to come back, as we had to hurry to get to the start of the race. So we all got our skies and got to the lift quickly, and the race started. Everybody was to go…</p>

It was with considerable pleasure that Katie anticipated the visit of her cousin Jane. Katie and Jane&#039;s mother being sisters, only separated in by two years in age, they had always enjoyed a close loving relationship, which had strengthened as they grew up. Even when they each left home to get married they still maintained close contact. Romaly (Katie&#039;s mum) had married first. She had married John, then an aspiring legal clerk now a successful solicitor. On the other hand, Heather, Jane&#039;s mum, had fallen madly in love with Joe, an assistant grounds man, who although he was diligent and conscientious had taken years to become head grounds man. Joe and Heather lived…</p>

When Katie had Joan and her mum to stay, she found that Jane had a severe weak bladder problem, which as it got better, made Jane increasingly randy. Katie became aware of her increasing responsibility so that when they left the village pub that night, she wished she had persuaded Jane to go to the loo before they left.As she felt the cool night air beneath her skirt she herself felt the need to wee, and was certain that Jane must be feeling it much more acutely. The fact that Jane had to wear an incontinence pair of panties that could not be removed without help made her more aware of her protective role with her friend. As they made their way up the village street…</p>

Both of us where so turned on by my wet state, it had resulted in torrid wet sex, (during which I had peed myself again) we were so carried away. Sadly we had to desist, because I needed to pick up our son from school. While I was waiting outside the school, my son was invited out to tea.

Melanie stopped to look at her. Late teens, probably, left behind when drink had gotten to her head and her companions wanted to party on. A pretty girl, long–limbed, with straight fair hair and a pale complexion; she looked almost transparent in her vulnerability. The dark stain on her jeans added to the helpless look. Melanie bent to shake her shoulder. &quot;Hey. Please, wake up.&quot; The girl moaned. &quot;Come on.
