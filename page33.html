        <p class="card-text">All stories contain female desperation, frantically searching for the Ladies&#039;, except for one male incident.
Sometime ago I wrote about my sightings of desperate women when I was working on a motorway service area. (See &#039;The Motorway Service Area&#039;) Some of the best sightings came from coaches on shopping trips before Christmas, so the next year I decided to see where they were going. The coaches were dropping their passengers at a small open space where several major roads met at the edge of the main, pedestrian, shopping area. This open space was crossed by several footpaths and underground pedestrian crossings (called subways in England), and had badly signposted public toilets. Since this open area, hardly…</p>

        <p class="card-text">The sun was setting majestically on the ocean, and the crowds on the beach had dispersed, but there were still quite a few sun–worshippers there. The beaches never emptied entirely on their island. Through her sunglasses, Rosemary looked up from her novel and admired the sunset. Another long, slow, beautiful day in paradise was coming to a close, and after nearly ten years she was finally beyond the too good to be true stage. It was true. She really lived here, and she really was a hero for the very reason she&#039;d been ostracized back home. She set the book down on her lap and pondered that thought once again.
Naturally, since she&#039;d stopped concentrating on the book, it wasn&#039;t long before Rosemary&#039;s attention…</p>

Jenny&#039;s first thought when she awoke was, I have to pee. The second was, &#039;Please don&#039;t stop fondling my pussy.&#039;
The significance of that second thought took some time to sink in. She was lying on her stomach with one leg drawn up, and a probing hand was stroking her from behind, parting her butt cheeks, sliding all the way up and down, catching her moisture, slipping inside her openings. But as she felt herself rise to orgasm she remembered. A small spurt of pee escaped her as she climaxed. She lay for a moment, just breathing. Then she felt arms embrace her and the pressure of breasts on her back. Slowly she turned and met Becky…</p>

It was a gorgeous day, simply no other way to put it. The sun was shining, the birds were singing, the air was warm and dry, with barely a cloud in the sky. It was the weekend, and the faire was the place to be! Games, rides, all sorts of fun! Everyone was there, including a girl named Amy. Amy was a darling, sweet girl. She was 5&#039;5, 110 pounds, dark just–below–shoulder–length brownish–black hair, beautiful smooth ivory skin, a face that had just the right…</p>

With only a week remaining until the election and early polls showing a near dead–heat between the senator and his vivacious challenger, everyone at Hazelwood&#039;s camp was putting in heavy overtime. &quot;Are you sure?&quot; Doreen persisted. &quot;You look like you could really use one.&quot; Sandy sighed. &quot;Yeah, I probably could, but I don&#039;t like to drink caffeine later in the day.…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Earlier today I had my first wetting experience (Playing Sick), and I can&#039;t stop thinking about it! I remember the warmth forming between my legs. I remember orgasming like I never have before as the pee flooded my panties. It was the most orgasmic experience of my life, but I needed to make it better. Last time I peed on the toilet. This time I would need to do something more exotic!
I lay back on my bed, again trying to study for my test. After all, I do have a test today. I tried to think of equations, but all I could think of was the sight of that wonderful dark patch growing in my panties earlier today. My panties were white and the pee was wet; it felt so good. It even flooded my bottom as I sat on the…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Jenna arrived at my condo at 2:00 pm to watch a football game. Jenna and I worked together for a couple of years, but never dated. She was the classiest and best–looking female in the company, and was widely known for being unapproachable. When she arrived, dark–haired Jenna was wearing a black t–shirt and a pair of designer jeans that laced up in the front like a pair of tennis shoes. After watching a few minutes of the game and drinking a beer, she got a very odd look on her face.
&quot;Jenna, is something the matter?&quot;
&quot;Well, I was with a friend named Erick before I came here. We were drinking at a bar for a couple of hours. I wanted to leave, but he wanted to talk in his car. As soon as we got in his car, be…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Barbara awoke slightly aware that something was wrong– her eyes flicked open, and she was not sitting in a country gateway with her panties round her ankles. She was in bed, with alarm bells sounding in her mind. Her hand went down to her panty crotch to confirm what her waking mind already knew. She had wet the bed!
She had been dreaming that she had been out walking her new baby son Mark around the countryside in his pushchair. She had somehow gotten lost, and was unsure about which way to go to find the quickest way home. Above all she really needed to wee but was unsure of the length of time it would be till she could make it all the way home.
Her need had suddenly become urgent and with her pelvic…</p>

The story begins with taking a minibus–load of people to see a concert at Wembley a few years ago.
Naturally, you can&#039;t get parked anywhere near, so the minibus was in a small car park about a quarter of a mile away. I&#039;d walked back to the stadium, to try and spot the party I was collecting. Naturally, a large crowd of people was coming out, and most of them were walking down the access road, which was about a quarter of a mile, I guess, although I bet it seemed further to the girl in the pink dress.
She was slim, and…</p>
