        <p class="card-text">I first saw her as I was walking along the main concourse at Kennedy Airport, looking for the departure gate for the American Airlines flight to San Francisco. She was perched up on one of the metal railings, shoes off and peering down at her feet. A slim blonde, probably in her mid–twenties, I could not help but admire how apt was her appearance– I&#039;d already recognized her flight attendant uniform as belonging to the Scandinavian Airlines (or SAS) stable. She was simply very cute, and as hard as I tried not to stare at her as passed, I just couldn&#039;t help myself.
She glanced up and caught me looking, but instead of quickly avoiding my gaze the way most western women would do, she smiled. It was an electric…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Jane lived up to her name. She&#039;d always been a plain girl and somewhat unattractive, I thought. She&#039;d been a classmate of my daughter when she was in school but after they left they sort of lost touch with each other. That was nearly ten years ago.
A couple of weeks ago, who turns up on my doorstep but Jane? She still looked quite plain. Not the sort of girl that would cause me to turn my head. Anyhow, out of politeness I asked her in and offered her a cup of tea, which she gratefully accepted. I couldn&#039;t help but notice that Jane was a bit fidgety as we caught up with things that had happened to each of us since we last saw each other, and she also asked after my daughters, so I gave her their phone numbers.…</p>

Jenny sniffed, wiped a tear from her eye with the back of her hand, and nodded meekly. So Sam led her upstairs and into the bathroom and began to run a bath, adding copious amounts of bubble bath. The sound of the water gushing into the tub was almost enough to make Jenny lose control and completely wet her knickers a second time, but she fought hard against the urge and just about managed to hold on. A couple of short leaks escaped, and she felt the pee gently dribbling down the inside of her thigh, but it was such a minor accident that Sam didn&#039;t even notice it.…</p>

A ray of light hits a sleeping girl&#039;s face and she tosses and turns as she slides into consciousness. Today was Shannon&#039;s 18th birthday and she couldn&#039;t have asked for a more beautiful day to celebrate it on. There wasn&#039;t a cloud in the sky and it was a perfect 30 degrees outside. Her friends had decided that they were going to take Shannon to dinner for her birthday and then throw her a party at her friend Sarah&#039;s house.

It was a two–carriage train and it was beginning to fill up, but the seat next to him was still empty, which pleased him. At the next station, however, several more passengers got on, including a very pretty blonde girl in her early twenties, who came and sat next to him. Godfrey shuffled up a bit to make room for the young lady. As the train pulled out of the station the young lady looked round and upon seeing that everyone was seated, she got up and went toward the toilet. She returned almost immediately and sat down looking a little irritated and uncomfortable. &quot;Typical of this damned rail company,&quot; she complained to…</p>

The sun beat down on her, and a heat haze rose from the pavement. A gentle breeze took the edge off the heat, but it was still easily the hottest day of the year so far. She felt thirsty, and wished she could take a long, refreshing swig from the bottle of water at the bottom of her bag; but she dared not. She was already feeling the first faint urges of the need for a pee, and there was nowhere that she could stop to use the toilet on the long walk across town to her old friend Samantha&#039;s house.

One Saturday one of the two girls couldn&#039;t come, leaving only four of us. I was already aware that Sally, the girl who did come, tended to have a smallish bladder, so I was interested to see that she brought a can of soft drink with her, which she drank on our way to the first house.

        <p class="card-text">We woke late, not surprisingly. When I opened my eyes, I found Julia&#039;s face before me, her head propped up on her hand. She smiled and rubbed her left leg against my thigh –– such a wonderful way to start the day and I did not suppress the groan at the pleasure it brought me. I reached down and stroked her thigh as it came within reach, relishing the softness of her skin.
&quot;That was quite a revelation last night,&quot; she said, smirking, her blue eyes peeping through the strands of her fringe. &quot;Why didn&#039;t you tell me about your.... interest before?&quot;
&quot;Why do you think?&quot; I said, shrugging slightly. &quot;I didn&#039;t think you&#039;d be interested. More likely, I thought it would scare you off.&quot;
She considered this for a moment…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Sue James badly needed to pee. In fact, she was absolutely bursting.
Waiting impatiently at yet another red light, she snatched the opportunity to tightly clench her thighs, something she found very difficult to do when actually driving. She closed her eyes, slapping the palm of her left hand repeatedly against the edge of the steering wheel. She had no idea why this should help her fight off the nearly–overwhelming urge to release the contents of her swollen bladder, but it did.
&quot;Oh, come on!&quot; she complained to the traffic light whose baleful red stare had halted her progress. The pain was growing intolerable.
Of course, she&#039;d been forced to hold on to a full bladder often enough in her career, especially…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Belle couldn&#039;t believe Michael had just left her here, tied up all evening with this damned ball in her mouth and her bladder really aching from being full for so long.
When he&#039;d suggested tying her up for the evening, she had been excited. This kind of foreplay had such a profound effect on Michael and invariably led to the most amazing sex. She had agreed readily, and without giving her time to reconsider, Michael had promptly dragged into the bedroom and started tying her up.
&quot;You&#039;re keen,&quot; she had remarked as he bound her wrists and pulled up a chair to secure one end of the rope to the overhead beam, preventing her from sitting down. He had looked down at her from his precarious perch and waggled his…</p>

        <p class="card-text">My girlfriend Mary has always been interested in pee play. We&#039;ve done all the usual stuff and I was looking for a new way to spice up the action. One day we got a package in the mail that had freezer gel packs to keep the contents cold. I looked at those gel packs and looked at Mary. I told her the gel packs would be part of our next bladder control scene. She got a terrified look on her face because she knew exactly what I had in mind.
That night we went to the local tavern for dinner and a few brews. I told Mary not to pee because I wanted to feel her swollen and hard bladder before we made love. She does this often and it turns us both on. We had 3 or 4 beers that night. She had no problem avoiding the…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Sharon handed her ticket to the uniformed steward who was standing on the platform beside the open door to carriage E of the Inverness Sleeper. He studied it for a moment or two and made a tick on a piece of paper on his clip board, then handed the ticket back to Sharon.
&quot;Turn right,&quot; he said in an indifferent, couldn&#039;t–care–less tone of voice. &quot;Third compartment. Your room mate&#039;s already aboard.&quot;
Sharon wasn&#039;t altogether happy with the idea of sharing a sleeping compartment with a total stranger, but that was the deal if you could only afford a standard class fare. First class passengers got a sleeping compartment to themselves; but first class fares were way beyond Sharon&#039;s means. So she hefted her…</p>
