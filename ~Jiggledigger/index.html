        <p class="card-text">Angela was a bartender at the Three Oaks tavern for ten years. She liked her job because the money was good, the customers were nice and she had lots of fun. She was divorced from an abusive, inattentive husband and she liked being single. The idea of working with and meeting lots of men appealed to her and she loved to tease them and hear their compliments, but she would rarely go out with them since Angela had a strict personal policy of not dating her customers, and besides, she didn&#039;t want to be bothered with dating anyway. She was a Bi sexual and liked the women as much as men, but Angela kept her private love life private.
She loved to tease, though, and Angie, as her customers referred to her, wore…</p>

        <p class="card-text">The bus was jammed with people and only a few would get off from time to time, but more commuters anxious to return home from their day&#039;s work would replace them right away. I was standing, as I had given my seat to an older woman a few stops ago. The man next to me got off at the next stop, exiting through the door in the middle of the bus, and the crowd of people shifted a little toward the back. I wasn&#039;t paying much attention because I was trying to pass the time by looking at the streets of the city as we drove by. I would always do this, because everyone was walking around in the center of town, including a lot of beautiful women, and it made the trip a little easier. Suddenly, the bus made a hard stop…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Jill always got really, really horny when there was a full moon. The full moon affects a lot of people in a lot of ways, but that&#039;s what it did to Jill. Let me describe her. Jill was a tall, slim brunette with beautiful olive skin, brown eyes, the perfect ass, and exquisite long legs. She loved to wear tight, sexy clothes... the kind that would make both men and women turn their heads when she walked into a room. Her favorite outfit was skin– tight faded jeans with a top that came down to just below her round, melon–like tits (she had these done). She could model jeans. She could wear these things –hot pants, micro mini skirts, even tight pants – and not look too trashy. Jill had a lot of fondness for teasing.…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Hi, here is a story (mostly true, but enhanced a little) about a girl I used to know.
We had been going together for a few months and watersports had been mentioned and we experimented a little, but nothing substantial. Her name was Jill, and she was beautiful. She was about 5&#039;7&quot; tall and had long beautifil legs, long dark brown hair and a slim but great figure. jill was very sexual by nature, as was her own contention, and we enjoyed some wonderful sex.
As I said we experimented with some peeing....she would pee on me and I on her and it was o.k., but I finally told her one day thet I was really into desperation. We had been partying....we both took the day off and decided to just hang out and drink beer...…</p>
