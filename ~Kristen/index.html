        <p class="card-text">My girlfriend, Michelle, and I went on a trip out of town a few weeks ago. We drove to a town that about 8 hours away to see a really big concert– the biggest event of the year. We had been looking forward to it for a long time (all weekend alone together... away from home). So we packed up our bags, loaded into my SUV, and headed off. We made it there in good time. Checked into a hotel. All that. So for two days we strolled around the concert grounds enjoying all the live performances by all the bands. And each night, we&#039;d wind up having even more fun in our hotel room– and in the hotel hot tubs (but that&#039;s another story).
Anyway... The bathrooms at the concert weren&#039;t wonderful, but they weren&#039;t the…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Tyler gazed around at the sparkling surface of the water of the crowded swimming pool. So many people seemed to have the same idea as him. It was a hot summer day, near the end of July and all of Tyler&#039;s buds had deserted him for their summer jobs. Bored and full of pent–up desires (solitary masturbation just isn&#039;t enough), Tyler donned a hot pair of swim trunks under his clothes, and headed over to the local pool. He was keen on all those dripping, scantily clothed females. Oh, how he envied the male lifeguards that worked there.
He scanned the edge of the pool, looking for a friendly face. Seeing no one he recognized, he then turned his focus to the vacant poolside lounge chairs. He finally spotted an empty…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Lisa flicked on her turn signal, quickly tucked her left hand back into her crotch and began to decelerate. She whimpered slightly as she swung her car over into the right lane. She had to pee so bad it wasn&#039;t even funny. She was one of that beautiful college girls– great body, lots of fun. She shifted around in her tight shorts, trying to relieve the pressures of her screaming bladder. Her nipples poked out against her hot pink tank top. She was trying to make it home, but finally gave up hope and pulled into the nearest clean gas station she could find. There few things she hated more than peeing in a dank and smelly bathroom. When she finally found a station nice enough for her standards, she was so…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Chloe looked so adorable standing there in the entrance of the County Fair, fishing around in her purse for money to buy tickets. Michael snuck up behind her and poked her lightly on the bottom. She spun around and her grabbed her in his arms. Chloe was breathless with anticipation of being kissed right then and there, but when the ticket–lady, some old prude wearing a silly fez hat cleared her throat, the couple deposited their money, grabbed their tickets and entered the brightly lit, spinning, colorful fair. It was a little corny as always, but they were two teenagers ready to have fun. Michael absolutely loved Chloe&#039;s outfit. It was sexy, but not sluttish. She was a short, light denim skirt, a fitted tee,…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Andrea had been living with Jake for a couple of years– so naturally; they knew basically everything about each other. Of course, there was one topic that remained painfully secret... for a while. Even though they were very much in love and were sexually active, neither knew of the other&#039;s secret fantasies and fetishes. And since they were afraid of what the other might think about their secrets... It took quite a while for them to come out in the open. It all started on a cool Friday night. Jake had been working overtime all week and Andrea was struggling with her new job. Both had been pretty stressed out lately and decided to jump–start their weekend. They booked a table at an expensive restaurant on Greene…</p>

        <p class="card-text">The clock tick–tocked slowly, every eye was watching the minute hand... any second now the bell would ring. Finally, the clock struck 3:00 and all of the students dashed out of the classrooms. After dumping their books in their lockers, Laura, Nicole, Lydia, Elizabeth (Liz), and Melissa met outside. It was a nice Friday afternoon and the girls had planned a &quot;Girls&#039; Night Out&quot; for that night. It was Elizabeth&#039;s turn to play hostess that night, so the gang was headed to her house. As usual, all the girls were giggly chatterboxes, except Lydia. Lydia was a quiet, timid girl, but she was being unusually quiet that afternoon. When questioned by the other girls, her reply was, &quot;Oh, nothing.&quot; So, thinking that she…</p>
