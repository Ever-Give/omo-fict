        <p class="card-text">When I first met Gill, it was a mutual attraction. She was an attractive blond, quite tall and at the time innocent, or so I thought. We were soon beyond just kissing and cuddling and starting to become more adventurous. But even in those early days there was a hint of things to come, but I was slow to recognize it.
She had a lovely body (still has) and I enjoyed looking at it and playing with it, as she did mine. I should have taken more notice of something that happened every time we indulged in mutual masturbation.
Either she went to the bathroom first, or wanted to when she was near to climax, but put it off till after we had cum and then sprinted for the toilet. At that time our activities where…</p>

        <p class="card-text">It was just my luck that the night before we where to do the shopping for our house party, there was the biggest snowfall for years. Then to make matters worse, the strong winds had caused the snow to drift. Although the snow ploughs had made the main roads passable, the remainder of the thoroughfares were blocked to cars, even off–road vehicles. Ian, my husband, had dug paths along with the neighbors, so people could walk. But the nearest town was 6 miles away.
After a lot of thought we decided on a plan of action, the nearest main road was one and a half miles across the fields. We decided to make a fun thing out of it and walk to the main road, then phone for a taxi.
Then all dressed up in sweaters, wind…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Barbara awoke slightly aware that something was wrong– her eyes flicked open, and she was not sitting in a country gateway with her panties round her ankles. She was in bed, with alarm bells sounding in her mind. Her hand went down to her panty crotch to confirm what her waking mind already knew. She had wet the bed!
She had been dreaming that she had been out walking her new baby son Mark around the countryside in his pushchair. She had somehow gotten lost, and was unsure about which way to go to find the quickest way home. Above all she really needed to wee but was unsure of the length of time it would be till she could make it all the way home.
Her need had suddenly become urgent and with her pelvic…</p>

Today we plan to go to the coast to stay in my mobile home, at Breckelsham Bay. You are wearing a green woolen sweater with a vee neck, which shows just a swelling of pink ample breasts, a blue pleated skirt, (which is quite short) over blue schoolgirl panties, with white ankle socks and white trainers. You look very attractive with your hair swept back. The car is comfortable and warm, and the weather sunny. After a time, we stop and have a drink at a pub. We are aware that it&#039;s holiday time so that we are relaxed and you drink two pints of lager. You don&#039;t have time to go to the toilet before we go, but…</p>

        <p class="card-text">When Katie awoke some time later, finding that she smelling strongly of dried pee, she remembered that she had to get the mink panties cleaned. She picked up the phone and rang the express collect delivery service, finding that an item could be cleaned and returned within an hour. Retrieving the panties from the radiator, she found that though they were dry they had a strong pungent odor, so to avoid embarrassment she added some strong perfume. Then sealing them in a bag, it would not completely mask the sexy smell but it might stop the cleaners from thinking too much.
The courier called later for the dirty panties, promising to return them in an hour and a half, leaving Katie time to shower, wash her hair…</p>

She was about to sit down, when she remembered that the panties she had on were wet, and would mark her skirt. She was about to remove them when suddenly the memory of what she had witnessed looking through the spy hole in the changing cubical, came back with vivid lucidity. In her mind&#039;s eye she again saw Lucy with her legs wrapped round Ian&#039;s waist, his prick squashed up the leg of the panties thrust in her pleasure hole pumping in and out of Lucy&#039;s cunt, and how the stimulated girl had been unable to refrain from pissing when she came, soaking…</p>

Jill was a little concerned about going in with no panties on, a predicament arising from their exploits in the car park. She felt her skirt was damp at the back, but Ian reassured her that it did not show. Going in to the club, which was very elegant, they checked in, and then proceeded to their respective toilets to freshen up. In the luxurious ladies&#039; toilet Jill wiped her tummy and legs with a damp flannel, before applying perfume between her thighs, wishing she had retrieved some clean panties from her case.

Jane had arrived suffering from a bladder complaint that left her with feeble control of her bladder and inclined toward having accidents. Her embarrassing state would be made worse if any sexual stimulation were indulged in; as it inevitably delayed the time it would take for the complaint to get better. Unfortunately, the medication that Jane was taking had a side effect that caused such vaginal irritation it drove Jane to near nymphomania. To make matters worse, the doctor had Jane fitted with a panty girdle that acted like a chastity belt, to prevent scratching…</p>

Jane and her mum were visiting her aunt and cousin Katie. Jane was suffering from a temporary weak bladder problem, complicated by the reaction she had to the medication. It caused bouts of near nymphomania due to the healing sensations, which if yielded to, by masturbation or sex that involved the requisite amount of friction, hindered the healing process. So far while on her stay Jane had only found relief by having first Katie then Alan pee over her clit during sexually arousing circumstances. To insure she did not give way to temptation her doctor had insisted that she wear only incontinence panties with liners that she could not remove without assistance. It…</p>

Jane and her mum were staying with Katie and her mum for a short holiday. Jane had arrived suffering from a bladder complaint that left her with a control problem and inclined to accidents. Her embarrassing state was made worse if any sexual stimulation were indulged in– for it most certainly delayed the healing process. Unfortunately, the medication that Jane was on had a side effect; it caused vaginal irritation that nearly drove Jane to nymphomania. To make matters worse, the doctor had Jane fitted with a panty girdle that acted like a chastity belt to prevent her from scratching or indulging in masturbation. It fastened in such a way that she could not remove…</p>

It was with considerable pleasure that Katie anticipated the visit of her cousin Jane. Katie and Jane&#039;s mother being sisters, only separated in by two years in age, they had always enjoyed a close loving relationship, which had strengthened as they grew up. Even when they each left home to get married they still maintained close contact. Romaly (Katie&#039;s mum) had married first. She had married John, then an aspiring legal clerk now a successful solicitor. On the other hand, Heather, Jane&#039;s mum, had fallen madly in love with Joe, an assistant grounds man, who although he was diligent and conscientious had taken years to become head grounds man. Joe and Heather lived…</p>

When Katie had Joan and her mum to stay, she found that Jane had a severe weak bladder problem, which as it got better, made Jane increasingly randy. Katie became aware of her increasing responsibility so that when they left the village pub that night, she wished she had persuaded Jane to go to the loo before they left.As she felt the cool night air beneath her skirt she herself felt the need to wee, and was certain that Jane must be feeling it much more acutely. The fact that Jane had to wear an incontinence pair of panties that could not be removed without help made her more aware of her protective role with her friend. As they made their way up the village street…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Those readers who are familiar with the events than had occurred earlier that afternoon will know that, following an accident (I wet my panties) while on the phone, had coincided with Ian&#039;s (my husband) unexpected return from work. Both of us where so turned on by my wet state, it had resulted in torrid wet sex, (during which I had peed myself again) we were so carried away. Sadly we had to desist, because I needed to pick up our son from school. While I was waiting outside the school, my son was invited out to tea. Which meant that when I returned home we would free to begin where we had left off. At Ian&#039;s insistence I was wearing the panties I had wet twice already, which was a big turn on. As a result, the…</p>
