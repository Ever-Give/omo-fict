        <p class="card-text">When Katie and Jill auditioned for the village pantomime, they had no idea what satisfaction they would derive from it. Both were reasonable actors, and very good looking, with the sort of figures that look great in costume. So they were not surprised when Jill got the part of the principal boy, &quot;Jack,&quot; and Katie the part of &quot;Alice&quot;. Now as everyone knows the story of PUSS IN BOOTS will remember, the story features Jack as the boy who becomes lord mayor of London, and Alice as Baron Hardups beautiful daughter who becomes Jack&#039;s Sweetheart. Rehearsals began, and the two girls found they had lots affectionate scenes together and one in which Alice declares her undying love for Jack, kissing him passionately.…</p>

        <p class="card-text">The Playground Revisited
As you may remember, Ian is telling how I wet myself in the park toilets. When I was young, I for one am hardly likely to forget as when my mum found my wet panties in the linen basket it was very embarrassing for me and I just escaped having my backside smacked. Some years later, having left the high school and waiting to go to college I was on holiday during the summer. I knew Ian (who lived nearby, (and who had been a participant in my first knicker wetting adventure) was in a similar situation but I was unaware that he had returned home. We had not seen a great deal of one another as our lives had been going in different directions. I was pleasantly surprised therefore, when as I…</p>

They ordered a second bottle of bubbly that they drank slowly; with Ian taking good care to see that Lucy drank most of it. When they left the club Lucy deliberately avoided going to the toilet even though she needed to go.They walked hand in hand along the main street soaking up the spring sunshine, occasionally stopping to look in shop windows, and Lucy was making no secret of the fact that she needed to pee. She was on the point of suggesting that they go round one of the quiet back streets, where because she had no panties on she could just stand open legged and piss on the ground. The…</p>

        <p class="card-text">You may remember my interview with the deputy head master prior to me taking up my job as a teacher, how it led to me leaving behind a large porcelain jug with pampas grass in it half full of my piss.After a torrid wet sex session Roger (the deputy head), and I had reason to be glad that Lucy (the school secretary) had not caught us and Roger had let fall the knowledge that she was in to water sports. During the next two weeks I had intended to ask Roger how he knew, but the moment just did not present itself. So when just before a term commenced I had to call in the school office for some syllabus notes, Lucy said, &quot;I see your interview went very well&quot;, and gave me a long hard look, I remembered the jug, the…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Things had not gone well that afternoon, so on my way home I stopped into a town pub. It was early and the place was quiet, I got a drink, then looked around for some place to sit. The joint was set out with alcoves with two or three stools at each short bar. I picked one whose only occupant was a good–looking blond. I asked if she minded me sitting next to her, she shook her head and I took that to mean, please yourself.I settled down, nursing my scotch and water and pulled out my newspaper, turning to the sports pages. I tried to see if there was at lest one nag that hadn&#039;t let me down, it didn&#039;t look good, I began to feel more depressed. Then suddenly I got the feeling I was being watched. I turned and the…</p>

She felt his hand under the front of her leather skirt making its way up her legs, his fingers rubbed over her cunt through the cotton gusset encountering her wetness &quot;you&#039;re doing it already&quot; he observed. &quot;It&#039;s not just leaked wee – it&#039;s love juice, I am dying to come as well&quot; she giggled. Then his fingers began to rub and tease, her thighs now were pressed together forcing the leaking pee to pond round the seat of her panties.The damp feeling round her bottom gave her a feeling of naughtiness, of being rude in public. Then as his fingers traced round her cunt lips, she felt herself responding,…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Lucy pressed her hands together between her legs wanting to pee very badly, the fact that she was on the verge of coming was exciting and made her legs tremble. There she was, in the cinema watching a horror film with her sister Jen, and the film so frightened her that though was dying to pee, she was afraid to go on to the toilet in the dark all alone. Jen was engrossed in the film and refused to accompany her. Now, peeing herself would not have worried her as she had done it in this very cinema a number of times, often brought on from being masturbated by Ian, her boy friend. Frigging her while she was dying to pee but could no longer resist coming, she had enjoyed a delightful combination that could only…</p>

Apart from occasionally being referred to as thunder thighs I have had my share of boy friends. I had finished the university, done my training, got my diploma, and a job. Not just any job, but at my old school, so I could live at home and it would be easy to pay back my loans. I had an appointment with the department head after lunch and as that was some way off, I arranged to meet an old friend of mine who was already a teacher. We met at a pub, I had not intended to have any booze at all but Sandra, ( my friend) pointed out that it might compose me before my interview. I…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Many years ago my first wife left me for a married man. A flying officer from a nearby air base. I was to say the least devastated, and suffered as many people do. About nine months later, I received a letter from the man’s wife, Jill, as a result of this I rang her. We had both been deeply hurt. We had suffered a lot in common. This led to a number of calls. During one of them the subject of frustration came up. I was both surprised and excited when Jill said that she suffered most in bed at night, more and more she was having to resort to masturbation. Which concerned her because she tended to make a noise when she climaxed, and was afraid she of waking her young children. This sort of talk galvanized me to…</p>
