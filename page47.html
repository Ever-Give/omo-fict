        <p class="card-text">My First Wetting (Part 1)
This is the true story of my first sexual encounter with piss. It was when I was 18 during the summer break.I spent my morning reading a book and drinking as it was a fairly hot day and only went to the toilet once after I woke up. After I finished the book, I went to the mall as I was planning to see a movie with my friend Jade. I met her at the box office and we bought our tickets and cokes. It was one of those really long movies and we both wanted to watch it for some time but we hadn&#039;t come round to it so this was one of the last screenings of the movie. We entered the cinema and it was fairly empty, there were only 2 other people in there. We picked some seats at the back away…</p>

        <p class="card-text">I found this story on one of my first &#039;net surfing&#039; sessions, in 1996, but the version I downloaded was incomplete, possibly due to my inexperience on the net, ending with the girls still on the train.

If the original author reads it, or anyone has the complete original version, I would like to have a copy, to see what really happened. The events remind me of the times when I used to drink in the West End of London at weekends, and it was possible to see at least one good desperation scene, though not up to this standard, almost every week.

        <p class="card-text">Living in the dorms in college provided a great chance to see desperate women needing to pee. My freshman year I lived in a dorm named Brandon Hall and consisted of three buildings. Brandon Hall 1, 2 &amp; 3. Brandon Hall 1 was the oldest of the three buildings and as such had communal bathrooms. 1st and 2nd floors were female floors and 3rd and 4th floors were male. Brandon 2 and 3 were both made up of suites with a bathroom between each two rooms. Brandon 2 was co–ed and Brandon 3 was all female. As a Freshman I lived on the forth floor of Brandon 1. There were two guys to a room and in the middle of the middle of the floor on one side of the hall was a large communal bathroom– 6 stalls, 6 urinal, 6 showers and…</p>

And it is the only time I have ever witnessed mass desperation by an entire floor of women. If you have read my other stories, then you are aware that in my freshman year I lived in a dorm that had communal bathrooms and that the floors were segregated. One of the things we did on the 4th floor &quot;ZOO&quot; was to adopt the 2nd floor girls as our sister floor. Through the course of the year we did service projects together, planned parties together and just socialized a great deal. We also played practical jokes on each other, all the time.

Jackie and I had left for home after an early morning breakfast that included a lot of coffee and juice. We choose to go west for spring break instead of the typical Florida or Padre Island thing that most college kids choose, as we both loved the desert and had friends in Palm Springs. As we drove along that stretch of deserted blacktop, listening to music on the radio, we talked and kept drinking away at a cooler of cokes that we had purchased. A couple of hours into the desert, having long passed the last remnants of civilization, or at least a gas station with a bathroom, I noticed…</p>

I&#039;ve often played little games with myself whilst out and about just seeing how long I can hold out without going to the toilet. Last weekend I woke up needing a wee but decided to hold on. I was planning a shopping trip and the thought of walking around town whilst desperate to wee was already turning me on. I drank plenty of orange juice with my breakfast and could already feel the pressure on my bladder building up. I put on my short denim skirt and a pair of black panties and set off for town.
The town was very busy and there were lots of queues. At one point whilst waiting at the bank I…</p>

Episode 4 – The Wet Zone
As Laurie&#039;s jeep was riding over campus grounds once more, she had some trouble keeping her mind on the road. Laurie sat fidgeting in her seat, trying to keep her feet on the pedals; she was wearing sandals, and she could see her toes curling in them. Her white cotton panties were already wet with sweat, partly from the heat, partly from the excitement but mostly because she was holding her sphincter muscle closed with all the strength in her body. Laurie was wearing a pink dress with a flower pattern, and both her thighs were pressing hard against each other through it; the soft fabric was the only thing that prevented her equally sweaty legs from…</p>

She had a slim figure and dark brown eyes that often shined in a naughty way when Randi had one of her schemes in mind. This was one of those schemes. She was scolding herself for leaving the house in tight, white jeans without peeing first, but it was a playful scolding and she intended to have fun today.

There wasn&#039;t going to be any alcohol in this car though, Amber thought, as she drove home, still with a slight buzz on. She couldn&#039;t believer her Dad let her take HIS car, his prized Mercedes, out on the town for one…</p>

        <p class="card-text">The next day in school I met up with Jo–Anne during lunch break. I hadn&#039;t gone to the toilets after my morning pee, and neither had Jo–Anne. We went to the football field to watch the school team practice. That was something we always did, but this time we went there more to pee our panties than to watch the game. We were sitting on the grass, our skirts out of the way and our legs up a bit. I counted down from 3 and we started to wet our panties at the same time. It felt great to pee in our panties with so many people around, and no one could see it. After lunch we went back to class, and the rest of the day I went to the toilet to pee trough my panties every chance I got, and more often than not I met…</p>

        <p class="card-text">This is Donna&#039;s story. I will tell it to you as she related it to us. One day, a few years ago Donna was outside with a few friends in the garden and they were all very giggly. At one point they were challenging each other to do all sort of things. Finally they challenged one of the girls to wet herself, which she did to her friends&#039; shock and laughter. They all laughed so hard that they almost ended up with wet pants.
A few days later she was in a store with one of those friends and she had to pee. Donna suggested to her that she could always pee her pants, just like the last time. Her friend suddenly got real nervous and giggly and asked Donna if she really meant that. Donna pressed the girl to just go in…</p>

        <p class="card-text">I&#039;m Lori, and I guess a few of you out there have liked hearing about certain things I do when I&#039;m by myself and I get a thrill telling about it. I do have a &quot;session,&quot; as I call them, that I&#039;ll describe. It&#039;s about doing it in these tight–as–skin jean cutoffs. I&#039;ll tell how I pissed in them on purpose then squirmed myself against all the hot naughtiness until I came.
You anxious boys (and girls too, I hope) that can&#039;t abide a touch of foreshadowing and background to illuminate and color this magical thing that makes us all interested in reading this stuff – you can click this narrative down, and get right to the description of my act. But I want to describe a little bit why I do what I do...I think it might…</p>
