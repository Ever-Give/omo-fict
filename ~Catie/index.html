        <p class="card-text">After my accident the first night of school, I realized I needed to put a waterproof sheet on my bed. Even though I didn&#039;t think I would need it again, the pee stain I had left was huge, and I couldn&#039;t get it out. So after my first day of classes, I went to a local store and found an absorbent mattress cover. It was actually better than the plastic sheets I had thought I needed, because it wouldn&#039;t crinkle.
Fortunately, Sarah wasn&#039;t in our room when I got back, and I was able to put my protective cover on my bed and remake it before she got back. It was a close call though– she came in about five minutes after I was done and asked if I wanted to go get dinner.
The next few days passed without incident. I was…</p>

        <p class="card-text">A few months after our soccer state championship, I was heading off to college. Though nervous, I was extremely excited to begin the next part of my life.
My parents helped me move in– I beat my roommate there, and was nearly finished when she came in with her parents. Her name was Sarah–she was a very pretty redhead. Our parents left and we got to talking– it turned out that she had played volleyball in high school, so we had a strong interest in sports in common. The girls next door stopped by around nine and asked if we were interested in going out that night. One of them, whose name was Ashley, had a sister who was in her senior year and said we could all go to a party at her boyfriend&#039;s house. We both…</p>

        <p class="card-text">When I was 18 and a senior in high school, our soccer team went to the state finals. We were playing in the semi–final game Saturday, and if we won, were playing in the state finals on Sunday. We headed up to Denver after school on Friday, because our coach didn&#039;t want us to play after a 2–hour bus ride. Unfortunately, the school was only planning to pay for Saturday night and all the girls had to share beds because we could only get half the rooms. I was rooming with three other senior girls. Kelly was a starter, like me, while Alyssa and Kira were backups. Though this was not a big deal, Alyssa played the same position as me and made it clear she thought she should be the starter.
Anyways, we got up to the…</p>
