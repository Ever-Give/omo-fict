        <p class="card-text">NOTE&#039;.The historical setting of this story is factual, but all of the characters are purely fictional. I was a senior high school girl living in 1939 Poland. I am also Jewish, which made me an outcast. We lived in a small town west of Warsaw with only a hundred Jews, and I was the only one in my class. And then there was Anna. She was a nice looking Catholic girl, outdoorsy with dark blond hair and tall like me. She seemed to fit in well, but one day a story spread like wildfire that she had tried to kiss another girl and was a lesbian. Anna denied it, or course, but the story was taken as fact, and Anna&#039;s friends at her lunch table forced her to leave. As usual I was eating alone, and I nodded to Anna that…</p>

        <p class="card-text">My name is Jenny. I&#039;m a nurse and I was on a bus from Montana to Seattle. I would have driven but had some car problems. In Spokane a cute blond gets on, sits across from me and promptly falls asleep. A few hours later after a rest stop I noticed the blond is still sleeping. In a half–hour she wakes up and we start talking. Her name is Lori and she is very easy to talk to, and we were having a good time until I see her start to squirm. Lori admits she really needs to pee and gets up to ask the driver to stop, then comes back with a very worried look on her face.
We talk some more, but Lori is getting frantic, and starts to bounce in her seat. And I am getting very turned on. Finally she reaches her limit, &quot;Oh…</p>

        <p class="card-text">&#039;How did it go so wrong,&#039; Gabri–Ann asked herself as she sat in her jail cell on this miserable, half–frozen planet. Since her empathic abilities had developed she sensed she was destined to meet her soul mate, the women she would join with for life, but it never happened. Then she started working for the Paltathion Ministry of Education, only to be arrested for murder. And then she had believed she could postpone her execution indefinitely by giving herself to Cota, but now even that had failed.
Gabri–Ann sensed the jailers were coming with a new prisoner, and she combed her short blond hair and straightened her robe before they entered. The new prisoner was wearing an officer&#039;s uniform of the Imperial…</p>

Hi, I&#039;m Renee, a 28–year–old chemist with Everett Pharmaceuticals. I first saw Gabriele at the company ladies&#039; softball game. She was medium tall, like me, mid twenties with short red hair, and she was clearly unsure of herself as she stood there while sides were being chosen. But I noticed something else besides her shyness. Her thighs and biceps looked strong...this woman worked out. No one else seemed to notice though, and she was chosen last by the other team.
She did not play until the last two innings. At bat with one out and a runner on first, she swings well and hits the ball hard. But it is right at our second baseman who catches it and then catches the runner off first..…</p>
