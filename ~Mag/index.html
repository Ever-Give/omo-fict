        <p class="card-text">It had started out as a sort of confession. I didn&#039;t know how Sarah would react, but I had really wanted to talk to Sarah about it, mainly because we always told each other our secrets. We had confided in each other since we first became friends over ten years ago. We knew most things if not everything about each other. So I didn&#039;t have too much of a problem telling her. I&#039;d had a little accident in my jeans on the way home from the station a few weeks earlier, and I had realised that wetting my knickers had really turned me on. My mum had been very understanding when I got home, and had confessed that she had wet her pants several times too over the years. I just hadn&#039;t quite expected this reaction from Sarah…</p>

        <p class="card-text">I should have gone at the cafe! Dammit! Someone had vandalised the loos at this– my home station! I had only just managed to jump on the tube before the doors shut, and I didn&#039;t need to go too badly then. Besides I thought I could use the loo here. The sign said the nearest public toilet was at Nightingale Road. I knew where that was, but, it was half a mile in the opposite direction from home. It was just getting dark and I should have been home at 5 o&#039;clock, it was now 5:15. Dammit! I would just have to hold it and walk the two miles home.
At 19 years old it seemed a bit much having to tell mum what time I would be home. But she worries, and it was only polite to tell her a time, I suppose. I had been sure…</p>

        <p class="card-text">I have always been interested in wet pants. It started when I was quite young, and I have never lost interest, even after 40 odd years!
I have wet myself more often than I can remember over the years. Sometimes fully peeing my knickers and making a puddle on the ground, but mostly just a bit wet, enough to show on tight jeans if you were looking for it! 
When I&#039;m feeling naughty though, I like to wait until the last possible minute to go to the loo. Most times I don&#039;t wet much, but I&#039;m often squirming and wriggling about trying not to pee myself, and doing the pee dance. I like the feeling of intense anticipation bordering on panic as I get towards not being able to wait much longer. Sometimes, particularly…</p>
