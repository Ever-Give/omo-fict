        <p class="card-text">I regularly notice during mass that this stunning young girl in the choir at St. Stevens Cathedral is shifting around nervously from one foot to the other. Especially, towards the end of the hymns and being that St. Stevens is a Catholic church, the hymns are sung at periods right through the whole mass, which means that the choirmembers have to sit through the whole mass before they can leave their box. Normally this doesn&#039;t prove to be a problem and the other choristers are rarely inconvenienced by this arrangement, even though the masses can sometimes run for 3 hours or more on holidays or festivals. However, this poor Irish lass doesn&#039;t have the fortitude of her fellow choirmembers and this has caused her…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Last weekend my wife and I attended a wedding here in Phoenix. It is getting a little warm so the ceremony was held outside. The wedding was to take place at 2 p.m. so we got there about 1p.m. There was a tent set up for the guests to drop off gifts and to get a glass of punch, etc. My wife was quite thirsty and started drinking punch and had 2 or 3 glasses within the first 10 minutes. She continued to sip until the ushers began to seat us. She mentioned she should have visited the restroom but did not have time to do so. After about 15 minutes into the ceremony she started to fidget and cross her legs tightly. I noticed her hand wander to the area just below her waist and press firmly. She was wearing a calf…</p>

The 20 girls who had made it through qualifying gathered on stage at the appointed time. The bet, the last to pee or leak would win the $50,000 dollar first prize. Any girl that could last beyond three hours would win an amazing $1,000,000!! The test, each girl would be asked to drink 6 pints of water over the next hour. At the end of that hour the clock would be set and to win the $1,000,000 dollars any girl would have to last three hours from that point. Each girl was wearing white panties and regulation grey t–shirts. Shelly had first heard of the competition when she was done her local bar one evening.

The main offices are plush, and the staff look the part – power dressing is the order of the day, a business jacket worn over a lacy bra, and a neat micro–skirt. They all have tanned, smoothly shaved legs. These girls are confident, almost all with gorgeous figures, and totally professional and business–like in their behaviour.
Friday morning was the weekly board meeting, the chief executive and fifteen of her immediate underlings would gather at 9.30 and thrash out the agencies business for the past and following weeks. All 16 of these girls vanished into…</p>

There were 12 of us, all girls in our 20s, and although we worked hard we had a lot of laughs. I dressed to fit in with the others – a smart brown suit with a short skirt that was barely decent. I felt good, and I looked good! Friday lunchtimes we went to the pub, taking a full hour. Colin – our immediate boss – would buy us all a drink, and we would all be a bit high as the weekend approached. The events I am going to tell you about happened on one of those fridays which started off exactly as usual.

She oozed confidence, and looked at the rest of us with that hint of pity that belongs to those naturally superior. She was smart too, it soon became clear that the course wasn&#039;t going to tax her much. We hated her looks, her luck, her full social life – we were polite, but bitches behind her back.
Mandy and I plotted her humiliation, but it was nearly a year before circumstances delivered us the perfect opportunity. It was a theatre attachment, 3rd day. Jane, Mandy and I were assigned to the same theatre – orthopaedics. The first case was a revision hip replacement – always long we had discovered. Jane…</p>

This was a one–off commission, but as you will see it turned out to be unforgettable. Outdoor calendar shoots with models were hard work, but great fun. We would work from 8am till dusk, only breaking for refreshments. Our food hamper and icebox were the only luxuries we had – it was cool mineral water for these smooth–skinned beauties.
I quickly sussed out their routine. They would spot a house near the shoot, and mid afternoon all 3 would slip away to knock and ask to use the loo. I got to enjoy the early afternoon when the morning refreshments had clearly hit the mark, and the…</p>

She wished that she had been for a wee–wee before she finished work, but she was too busy chatting to her friend, and before she knew it, it was time to dash out for her bus. She had held it all afternoon, being too busy to go to the toilet, but she hadn&#039;t drunk much coffee that day, so her need to wee had not been too pressing.
Now, however, she was desperate, and her bus was due any second. She didn&#039;t think that she could hold on till she got home. She was tempted to let some of her wee go now, but there was a man standing at the bus stop, and she didn&#039;t want to wee in front of him.

That was not all that unusual, probably a fisherman. But as he got within sight of the object, he noted that it was not one but two boats, one a large sport fisherman, the other a “Cigarette” type speedboat. It was unusual to see boats nested like that in the open sea, so Maxwell decided to have a closer look. 
When he focused his binoculars on the boats, his blood ran cold. Two men on the after deck of the sport fisherman were taunting a woman, pushing her back and forth between them, taking turns roughly kissing and pawing her. He quickly rigged his sea anchor and launched his Zodiac,…</p>
