        <p class="card-text">In my previous story, I explained how I had my first–ever real accident when I was incredibly desperate and sneezed. I had decided to &quot;hold it&quot; on purpose, and had become so desperate that when I sneezed, I peed my pants.
But although I didn&#039;t really enjoy peeing my pants, I really liked the feeling of being desperate, so I decided to do it again.
About a month after the incident described above, I once again found myself needing the toilet during our first fifteen–minute break period, and denying myself that relief because I wanted to be desperate again. I&#039;ve found that having a full bladder is extremely pleasurable for me, and I often put off going to the toilet for long periods so that I can experience…</p>

        <p class="card-text">I had my first–ever real accident the other day. I&#039;m not sure if that is reason for celebrating, but through all my hanging around on various sites and such, people always exclaimed that, &quot;Everyone has had an accident in their lives!&quot; And I always felt chastened, because I never had, and people seemed to think I was lying when I said so.
Anyway, as to the day and incident (accident) in question...
I was at work, and it was a very long day. We don&#039;t get a lunch hour or tea breaks, not as you would understand them. We get two fifteen–minute breaks over the course of six hours.
