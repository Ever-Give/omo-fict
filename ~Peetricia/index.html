        <p class="card-text">Last week I had to go to a Handy shop in a big shopping mall. My drill didn&#039;t work and i had called the shop owner if it is possible to get a new. When I arrived at the shop, it was terribly busy, so I decided to go for a little shopping tour and come back later. It was a very hot day so I went into a cafe and bought an ice cream and a coke and sat out on the balcony. Afterwards, I went into some clothing shops and bought a nice short top. Before I returned to the Handy shop I bought another bottle of coke and then I slowly walked back.
When I entered the shop, only two guys were inside looking at the shop windows. Behind the counter I saw a big very well built guy with dark brown hair and wonderful blue eyes…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Hello!
This is a true story about my first peeing accident on our short trip to Paris.
I am a 20 years old girl from Germany and I had a very bad peeing accident last week at our school trip to France. It was a very hot day when we had our last day in Paris. It was 8 or 9 o&#039;clock p.m. when we left our hotel and put the luggage in the bus. We had to drive nearly 10 hours home, so my friend Marie and I bought 2 six packs beer and a bottle wine to have a party during this long journey. We drank a lot and had a lot of fun.
After 2 hours I first recognized that my bladder was full. The toilet in the bus was defective so we had a break every 2 hours to go to the bathroom. The last break was only 15 minutes ago so…</p>
