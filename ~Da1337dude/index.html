        <p class="card-text">Most people thought of them as the most despicable/disgusting/unpopular girls in the school, but some thought of them as heroes – not to mention a real turn–on.
The pee gang was a group of three senior girls – Rachel, Melissa, and Randy. They were famous for the wetting stunts they frequently pulled. Probably their favourite trick was to use a two code–word system. Most people had no idea how they did it, but then again most people didn&#039;t try to be around every time the pee gang put on one of their shows. They&#039;d stage a casual conversation, use one code–word to indicate when they were ready, which would then be repeated by all the other members of the group to indicate that they, too, were ready, and another…</p>

        <p class="card-text">MAJOR CHARACTERS:
Marilyn: The main character. She has long, blonde hair, a smooth, unblemished face, and sexy, but not overtly big, boobs.
Julia: The leader of the group Marilyn hangs out with, and a rather popular girl. She is a little short, and has flowing, shoulder–length black hair.

Kate: A member of Julia&#039;s group.
Topaz: A member of Julia&#039;s group. She has fairly short, curly orange–blonde hair, and has a special role later on in the story.
Rory: The girl who starts the…</p>
