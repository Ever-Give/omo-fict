        <p class="card-text">Lena put her bag down on the bench and looked around. It was her first time in this gym, but she would probably find her way around easily. After her divorce she had decided to start anew in a number of ways. She was thirty–two, with a very feminine, rounded body and wavy, unruly blonde hair often worn in a ragged ponytail. She looked great in tight Levi&#039;s and anything that revealed her cleavage. Pity the sad bastard of a husband didn&#039;t appreciate her shapes. She removed her pink halter–top and her black lace bra, needing the sports variety under the Lycra top to support her while exercising. She slipped out of her jeans – no, she had to wriggle – and put her black jazz pants on. With her towel around her…</p>

        <p class="card-text">A Chinese shop assistant provided me with one of the most interesting lunch hours of my life. I made a visit to Wendovers, a new clothing shop in the High Street to buy some new shirts. While I searched the racks for shirts in my size, and in my style, I overheard a conversation going on between two of the shop assistants. As I began to listen, my ears literally pricked up.
I had already noticed the Chinese girl when I came in. She was slim with long black hair, and dressed in typical working attire –– black heels, black pencil skirt and a white short–sleeved blouse. She was standing in an enclosed area where the tills were located, along with an older woman with a repellent perm and frumpy clothes.

        <p class="card-text">I wrote about our last experiment. We had great success chilling her bladder with an ice pack. Mary was intent on holding her bursting bladder much longer...she is usually so strong that way. She does it for me because it&#039;s the ultimate turn on for me. However, the ice pack on her pelvis broke her will in less that one minute.
So, I got to thinking about other ways to chill her. I wish we had a walk–in freezer, but we don&#039;t. I imagined using the freezer at the local pizza joint, but I knew the owner wouldn&#039;t appreciate the mess.
I thought about waiting until the cold weather returns, but that&#039;s months away.
All of a sudden, I knew the solution. We have a 2–quart enema bag hanging in the closet. We use it…</p>

That&#039;s right, he&#039;s no super hero, doesn&#039;t have a 12&quot; schlong, and wasn&#039;t the homecoming king. He is not the wettest diaper in the pail; I guess you could say among us pee folk. It&#039;s just that Harold is no more blessed with luck than he is with anything else.

In the morning I took a shower and put on a short grey cotton skirt and red button up t–shirt with snowmobile boots, and made a last cup of tea to keep me awake.

We were due to attend a seminar in the city that week and Jill was going to borrow her mother&#039;s car and drive to town. She wanted to park at my house and then we could go into the city by train. She was not a particularly attractive girl, but I had nothing much going on at the time, so I told her to be here at 8.30 so we would have plenty of time to get into town.
Jill duly arrived about 10 minutes late. She was a tall thin girl, with long light brown hair but with very plain, or even unattractive, looks. However she was wearing skin–tight jeans that were stretched over her…</p>

She drank her coffee and paid her bill, then walked in the direction of the square. Her long black hair reached almost to her waist; and below her waistline the contour of her panties was visible. She preferred full–size, as everything went straight through thongs, leaving no more than a sneeze–stain. She had lived in this country for fifteen of her twenty–three years, but…</p>

We continued to live there until my father left the RAF some years after the war (he was a &#039;regular&#039; rather than an enlisted man) and we moved to other accommodation. The property was in a fashionable part of town, but had been &#039;requisitioned&#039; by the Government, that is &#039;borrowed&#039; from the rightful owners and divided up to give a roof over the heads of families made homeless by the war.

        <p class="card-text">I&#039;ll begin with an introduction I suppose. I&#039;m a 20–year–old female, bisexual, name withheld, with a fetish for male and female desperation, although I&#039;ll admit I enjoy male desperation a bit more. (What can I say? I love the cock.) Anyway, the following is a few stories about my then boyfriend, let&#039;s call him Jake because I&#039;m not about to give out any names, who was known for his habit of forgetting to/never wanting to use the bathroom, or simply not noticing he had to go until it was critical. He&#039;d just try to ignore it, saying nothing, because he was having a good time with his friends or sit down to try and alleviate the pain until he could take it no longer, and suddenly dash off to the bathroom. I have…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Nicole was having the time of her life. She had just turned eighteen, and was a senior in high school, living the good life and having fun with her friends. She was a very popular girl because of her sweet nature, and all the guys were dying to be with her due to her sheer beauty and bubbly, friendly personality. She was about five feet, four inches tall, and had straight dark hair. She had big, beautiful brown eyes, a perfect smile, and a very slim face with skin that was smooth to the touch. Her body was a delectable light tan – a product of many visits to the tanning parlor. She had perfect curves over her whole body. Her stomach was hard as a rock, and her legs were long and essentially perfect. Perky…</p>

        <p class="card-text">School was going by so slow. Well, that&#039;s what 18–year–old Nicole thought anyways, sitting in her high school chemistry class. Nicole was a dream girl...shoulder length brunette hair that she always had in some sexy position and never wore the wrong way. Always wearing her short skirts with her stockings and high heels...and of course, today, she was wearing one as well. A short pink skirt that definitely wasn&#039;t school dress code length, but she managed to keep her fingertips above it and black stockings that ran right up to under the end of her skirt with her black high heels that just went past her ankle. And her cute little top that was way too tight and showed off her 32 C breasts nicely. All the guys…</p>

        <p class="card-text">We were falling in love...all we needed was a jellyfish!
It had been a beautiful day. A group of us from work had gone for a long ramble along the coast. We were at a place called &quot;Yorkies Knob&quot; (no kidding!) near Cairns in Australia. We had had lunch under some trees listening to the endless roll of the surf. Of course it was hot, and fortunately, we had taken plenty to drink.
After lunch we all seemed to split up a bit. I realised afterwards that my friends had sensed that Alice and I needed a bit of time alone even before we even knew ourselves! Alice has lovely long dark brown hair, and an incredibly sweet smile – I always go for the smile! To be honest, I&#039;d rather assumed that she had a boyfriend…</p>
