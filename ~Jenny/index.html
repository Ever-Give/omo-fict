        <p class="card-text">Hi there, I wanted to tell you about my experience in the park yesterday. Now I really like to pee myself, even in public occasionally, but I am usually prepared – like I have a spare pair of panties at work or in my handbag. But today was different. I like to walk in the park sometimes at lunch to keep in shape. I was doing my usual, wearing a pair of short black tights (which show my butt nicely) and a drab grey shirt. I had taken an hour for lunch so I could do a slightly longer walk, feeling a little guilty for all the chocolate I had eaten the day before – I like the fact both guys and girls look twice at me sometimes, and don&#039;t want to lose that! Well, I was kind of busting to pee, but I persisted on,…</p>

        <p class="card-text">I never thought that ripping a pair of pants could be a good thing! I came to work this morning, and then went in for a pee – looked down, and there was a gaping hold in my slacks! The first thing I did was start to walk funny, and then made a lame excuse to get an hour of work to go to the city and get a replacement pair real fast. I went into town and got the new pair, and then had a wild idea – I had never wet myself in a pair of pants in public before! I always wear a skirt so the pee can come out without showing too bad. And since I had a spare pair now, I got excited and thought this would be a great idea. 
First I went to the food hall and got the largest coke I could find – I kind of already needed to…</p>

        <p class="card-text">I just wanted to tell you something that happened today on the bus... I was sitting there, waiting to get home, when I noticed a girl on the other aisle (kind of good looking) in a pair of black slacks and a red shirt – but she had her legs just a little open and a hand in between them, curled right up against herself! I watched her for a while, and she was rubbing herself– I could tell she either was dying to pee, or was playing with herself... As we got nearer to where she got off, she put her bag on her lap and curled up a little, then squeezed her eyes shut – and then put her hand between her legs for another rub! I was rather turned on now myself, and dying to know what she was doing! She then got off the…</p>

        <p class="card-text">I want to tell you about when I went shopping last night.... I was kind of dying to pee when I arrived – I came straight from work. I went to the local Coles’ (a supermarket here) and looked for a ladies, but couldn&#039;t find one! Not wanting to waste too much time, I went for the &#039;quick shop&#039;, and thought I could maybe get home. While I enjoy peeing in my panties, I am not usually a public person! Anyway, with a couple of minor &#039;drips&#039;, and a bit of holding and crossing my legs, I made it to the last aisle... But I had forgotten two things – so I went to the first and then the problem started! While walking to the next item, I bumped into a corner (trying to rush I suppose) and let out a bigger gush of pee...…</p>

        <p class="card-text">I stumbled across your site about 2 weeks ago, and at first thought it was weird! But in a few days, I was so curious I came back for another look, and now think that peeing is sexy! I saw all your stories, and thought I would tell you about my first outdoor peeing experience, which took place today! Me? I&#039;m 25, about 5&quot;6 tall, and though not a supermodel, I am often called &quot;cute.&quot; I like myself, anyway. I am a bisexual – I like girls more, because they know how to please another girl – and I had some bad guy experiences as a younger teen. But anyway... I was in the mall today, and was kind of horny since I had been looking at your site before I went out. I kind of planned to see how far I would go in public –…</p>
