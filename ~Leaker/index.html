        <p class="card-text">Just before I was served a nice southern breakfast in a southeast Virginia town I saw something of interest that captured my interest for the next several minutes. It was about an hour and a half after sunup and a bus from the nearest town had just dropped off a passenger that was one of the most beautiful African–American girls I had ever seen. She was standing in the large driveway that served the restaurant where I had the occasion to dine that morning so I got a close up view of her.
And, from her intense watching of the road that crossed the main thoroughfare I assumed that she was waiting for a ride, probably to her home. She had probably worked the midnight shift at one of the mills in town and had…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Barbara had managed to get herself into a situation that she had promised to never do again. She had wound up in the third period class in a desperate need to go to the bathroom.
At her school any request to leave the classroom was to be refused so Barbara was left to squirm and fidget throughout the class in the hope she could hold her water until the end of the class. Squirm and fidget she did telegraphing to all her nearby classmates the cause of her distress. Barbara had to pee very badly and her friends knew it.
