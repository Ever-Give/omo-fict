        <p class="card-text">About 10 years ago, a woman in her late 30s or at the most 40 lived next door to me. She had a husband and teenage son who were away during the day at work and school. Her role was housewife, and during the warm weather months she was out working in her yard and garden most days.
Our backyards happened to be separated by a chain link fence and I could look into her yard and watch her from my kitchen window, which I often did, as she was quite easy on the eyes. She was ever–so–slightly on the plump side, with high, pointed, perfectly shaped breasts, a nice little roundness to her belly, a marvelously shaped butt, smooth, youthful–looking legs, and a cheerful, outgoing personality. Her work clothes were usually…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Cold Wet Weekend Part 1
Madeline was a sweet 19–year–old girl (In her mid 20&#039;s now) that used to live down the road from where I used to live. In fact, sometimes I dreamed about her. She was the nicest, not to mention the most beautiful girl in the neighborhood. She stood about 5&#039; 11&quot;, weighed about 120 pounds, long red curly hair, green eyes, bright red lips, and a dark complexion. She was pretty popular in those days, but she never went out much after she left high school. For some reason (which I do not know to this day) she didn&#039;t carry on any relationships past high school.
One hot summer evening, at an ice cream stand, we finally stood toe to toe for the first time since the 7th grade. She had claimed…</p>

        <p class="card-text">This is my first attempt at posting here – hope you like it. This is also a fantasy – there is no Sarah and the events portrayed are completely fictitious.
I&#039;d been going out with Sarah for quite some time, and we had a fairy normal boyfriend/girlfriend relationship in all respects. I had never mentioned my interest in watersports and I&#039;d never had the slightest indication that she was interested either. Then one day we decided to go to the seaside. We wanted somewhere fairly secluded, so the trip turned into a long weekend in Cornwall. I don&#039;t remember exactly where we ended up – we stayed at a B&amp;B in Truro, but we drove for quite a while before we found what we were looking for. The beach was perfect – a…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Once again, this is very loosely based on a real event, but all the characters are pure fiction.
About five or six years ago, soon after Sarah and I first met, she came to me with an idea for a short break. She had seen some information about a riding center in the Scottish Highlands, where you could ride out around Loch Ness, and being a keen horsewoman she thought it might be fun to combine that with a few days&#039; holiday. I was OK with the idea, as I love the Scottish mountains, so the idea became a plan. She also asked if a friend of hers, Abigail, could come along too. We booked rooms at a B&amp;B in the village of Drumnadrochit, which is right on the edge of Loch Ness and very close to the riding center,…</p>

Hell, even Jane had no idea what was soon to come. Sitting in Jane&#039;s car, Annie could barely contain her excitement. Jane was always the wild one, doing crazy things for attention. One time she set her lawn on fire, just to get her parents&#039; attention, so she could show them what she had learned in dance class that day. But Annie admired Jane, for she did what Annie could only hope to do, and Jane usually did it for her as well. As they pulled into the mall parking lot, Annie&#039;s stomach starting jumping and fluttering inside of her. Annie had never been to this part of town, although…</p>

I did something new last night. I&#039;ve been reading the stories on this site for about a year and enjoying them and some of the pictures. What I&#039;ve most enjoyed is the knowledge that there are other people out there who enjoy the same sort of thing that I do. I thank you all for being there and helping me enjoy being the person who I am. But about last night...
I enjoy wetting myself. If you&#039;ve been reading my stories from last summer that should be pretty obvious. I&#039;ve been wetting my panties for several years and discovered the thrill of actually wetting my pants last summer. I can hardly get enough of that feeling when I first start to let it go, when I can&#039;t quite tell if I&#039;m getting wet or…</p>

In 1990, I was in hospital for some months– I was very ill and had to build up for a difficult surgical operation. There I liked to visit the nurses who had to do the night shift. I could do that, because I was near to the inventory of the station and knew the girls a little better after a while. A fixed night nurse regularly did the night shift for one week as well as another of the nurses from the station, and they worked on a rotating system, so when the fixed night nurse had her week off, each of them did the shift in her place.

        <p class="card-text">Madison was my best friend in my junior year of high school. We became close almost instantly, and we were almost never apart. We told each other everything, so it was only natural that she told me about how peeing made her come. I told her that I was the exact same way, and within a few months of meeting, we became lovers. We would always go to each other&#039;s houses, or drive somewhere secluded, and act out our most wild fantasies. One day, on the way to a most often deserted field, our most memorable experience occurred. We had started the day by drinking lots of coffee like we always did. Then we got into the car, she was driving, and turned on the radio. Usually, we managed to hold our pee without leaking…</p>

        <p class="card-text">As she watched her mom pull out of the driveway, Becca could hardly contain her excitement. She had waited all morning for this. She had started the day by drinking lots and lots of coffee, telling her mom that she needed to wake herself up to study for her finals. As she sat down at the computer now, she started to look at sites with pictures– pictures of girls wetting their panties, pictures of girls masturbating, and even pictures of girls humping each other. How she longed to do the same. Her clit began to tingle.
Her mom had told her to do the laundry. Now she had a wonderful idea. She made her way into the laundry room, and decided to do a load of jeans. She picked up the first pair, and put them on.…</p>

        <p class="card-text">There was a bit of a delay getting this third part out to you all. I thought I had sent it just a couple days after part two, but I think I suffered a bit of an organizational breakdown. At any rate it never got sent, but here it is now, better late than never. I hope you all are enjoying reading this– it has gotten longer than I thought it would. At first I thought two parts would take care of it, but it is really a lot of fun to write about, so I&#039;m including all the detail I can remember. I&#039;ve decided to put my e–mail address on this one just so I can hear how you all like my story. You can write me using the link at the bottom of this page. All I ask is that you don&#039;t bother trying to find out who I am and…</p>

Hi, I&#039;m Renee, a 28–year–old chemist with Everett Pharmaceuticals. I first saw Gabriele at the company ladies&#039; softball game. She was medium tall, like me, mid twenties with short red hair, and she was clearly unsure of herself as she stood there while sides were being chosen. But I noticed something else besides her shyness. Her thighs and biceps looked strong...this woman worked out. No one else seemed to notice though, and she was chosen last by the other team.
She did not play until the last two innings. At bat with one out and a runner on first, she swings well and hits the ball hard. But it is right at our second baseman who catches it and then catches the runner off first..…</p>
