        <p class="card-text">It was a Saturday night, Jane and Lori had come to the big city for a week long holiday and tonight they had hooked up with 2 guys, Brad and Justin, that they had met at the club downtown. They knew that neither of them would be able to drive, so Jane and Lori had left their car at Jane&#039;s cousin&#039;s house where they were staying. They had been drinking for about 4 hours– and just recently had a couple of pitchers of beer. They knew that the last bus ran at 2:15am and they would have to make it or have no way home, as a person could never get a taxi at that time of night. The guys were also taking the bus, but in the opposite direction, and said that their last bus would run 1:55am. It was getting close to that…</p>

        <p class="card-text">This is a story about male and female desperation. It happened at a concert last summer.... And yes... that&#039;s me in the pictures.
It was a hot July night and a very popular band was playing at an outdoor concert in the park. My friend Jess, and our dates Mark and Brad were all going to go with me to the concert. It started at 9pm, but at about 7pm we all met at Mark&#039;s house to have a few drinks before we left. There would be a beer gardens there but we wanted to get buzzed before we got there. Since it was a warm night Jess and I were both wearing tank tops, me with a skirt and her with shorts. Both the guys just had on t–shirts and khaki shorts. We started with a couple shots each and then switched to beer,…</p>
