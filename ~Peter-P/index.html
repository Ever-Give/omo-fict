        <p class="card-text">A Competition Becomes a Never Ending Nightmare
If I had superhuman abilities, I would like to get invisible and to have mind–control over strong bladdered women. It should be possible to find them by their thoughts while they are holding it. Afterwards I would read and manipulate their minds while looking inside of them while they are doing their best to hold it.
Then the following situation would be possible. Possibly it could also happen without any manipulation, just because these two women are very ambitious and really tough.
Note from Ger: This story is of course complete fiction. Don&#039;t even try to hold your pee as long as written below. Not even in a kind of sadistic game. Holding your pee too long –…</p>

        <p class="card-text">From my last story you already know of my former friend, whom I called my Bladder Queen. Here is a new – real story of how she tried to find her limits.
My lovely &quot;Bladder Queen&quot; was a tourist guide who rode in double–decker sight seeing busses. We were in love and a couple for a few years. She often waited way too long and then (deliberately) would be shivering with her legs, to hold it a little easier. But she just did this when we both were at home. Outside she never showed any (visible) sign of her often really urgent need to pee. When she got really desperate in public, she just whispered into my ear that she could not hold it any longer. But my friend never wet her panties, not even when desperately…</p>

        <p class="card-text">I had the most exciting experience with a big bladdered woman some years ago. I found a new love with a fascinating woman for a longer time.
This two–part story really happened some years ago and I have NOT elaborated or changed any of the described facts!
I won&#039;t tell you her name, but she was a slim and sporty woman of 32 years at the time and had very long, dark, brown hair. She was very beautiful, and had a fascinating smile– and she had the best–trained, incredibly massive, persistent bladder that I have ever found. She was very tough and had really strong nerves– a fascinating woman also possessing many other good qualities but that&#039;s not the theme of this water sports community.
For the fans of stats…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Note: This &quot;story&quot; contains Female Desperation.
In 1990, I was in hospital for some months– I was very ill and had to build up for a difficult surgical operation. There I liked to visit the nurses who had to do the night shift. I could do that, because I was near to the inventory of the station and knew the girls a little better after a while. A fixed night nurse regularly did the night shift for one week as well as another of the nurses from the station, and they worked on a rotating system, so when the fixed night nurse had her week off, each of them did the shift in her place.

One of these nurses, Silke, used to drink 3 liters of red tea. It was some kind of fruit tea, which seemed to have a bit of a…</p>
