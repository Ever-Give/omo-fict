        <p class="card-text">Sharon handed her ticket to the uniformed steward who was standing on the platform beside the open door to carriage E of the Inverness Sleeper. He studied it for a moment or two and made a tick on a piece of paper on his clip board, then handed the ticket back to Sharon.
&quot;Turn right,&quot; he said in an indifferent, couldn&#039;t–care–less tone of voice. &quot;Third compartment. Your room mate&#039;s already aboard.&quot;
Sharon wasn&#039;t altogether happy with the idea of sharing a sleeping compartment with a total stranger, but that was the deal if you could only afford a standard class fare. First class passengers got a sleeping compartment to themselves; but first class fares were way beyond Sharon&#039;s means. So she hefted her…</p>

        <p class="card-text">&quot;Is this it, then?&quot;
&quot;Yes,&quot; Andy nodded. &quot;This is Byron&#039;s Pool. You seem disappointed.&quot;
&quot;I am a little,&quot; said Helen. &quot;I&#039;d been expecting something a bit more ... well ... spectacular.&quot;
She looked around once again while Andy drove the punt pole deep into the riverbed and looped the mooring chain around it. They were hove–to in the middle of a clear, shallow pool with a sand and gravel bottom. It was no more than fifty metres long, and perhaps thirty metres across at its widest point. Long strands of green weed streamed out in the current, and the occasional stickleback darted in and out between them. At the upstream end of the pool was an ugly concrete weir over which the river rushed headlong in an angry,…</p>

        <p class="card-text">In all my life I had never known anyone who was remotely as androgynous as Terri. Everything about her was just totally ambiguous, and I continued to harbour some residual doubts as to her true sex right up to the moment she began to wet herself. And even then, it was only the obviously &quot;female&quot; pattern of the wet spot spreading across the front of her jeans from a point slightly below the bottom of her zipper which finally convinced me that she had to be a girl, even though the visible fastenings on her clothes all did up on the &quot;boys&#039; side.&quot;
She boarded my train at Mile End. I had traveled in from Loughton, so naturally I had a seat. By Mile End, however, the train was becoming crowded and several people…</p>

        <p class="card-text">&quot;Punting on the Cam is jolly fun they say,&quot; said Helen, taking the last slice of pizza from the box.
&quot;Jolly fun,&quot; mimicked Andy. &quot;When did you start talking like that?&quot;
&quot;I didn&#039;t,&quot; said Helen. &quot;I was quoting a song. Don&#039;t you know it?&quot;
&quot;No,&quot; said Andy, popping the cork on the bottle of cheap sparkling white wine.
&quot;Garden Party. Marillion,&quot; she prompted.
&quot;Never heard of it, or them. And anyway, we&#039;re not going punting on the Cam. We&#039;re going punting on the Granta.&quot;
&quot;I thought there was only one river in Cambridge,&quot; mumbled Helen through a mouthful of dough, tomato, cheese, pepperoni, mushrooms, and peppers.
&quot;There is,&quot; said Andy, taking a swig of wine and passing the bottle to Helen. &quot;And it changes name…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Lucy drew the bedroom curtains, switched on the answer phone, and placed her new purchase on the bed. Then she guiltily took off her dress and hung it up in the wardrobe. Next she kicked off her shoes. Finally she took off her knickers and bra, and dropped them in the laundry basket in the en–suite. When she was totally naked, she nervously picked up her new purchase. It was a pair of light blue knickers with a floral print pattern.
She stepped into the knickers and quickly pulled them up; then she stood in front of the mirror on her wardrobe door, and studied her reflection intently. She looked much as she remembered looking that dreadful day, 15 years ago, when she had last worn a pair of knickers with a…</p>
