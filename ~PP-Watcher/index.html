        <p class="card-text">This is a true story– as are all of my stories. The outcome of this incident was unplanned. Due to the nature of this story, I strongly urge the readers NOT to try this themselves. There is an inherent danger for those that are untrained that could cause long lasting damage and have legal implications.
As with almost everyone I went to college with, I had a minor that I pursued. It was in psychology. I had not intended to minor in psychology, but by chance, my psychology 101 instructor happened to be a renowned expert in the field of behavioral psychology. His lectures were interesting and I found myself very interested in his work. He was conducting several clinical studies on campus and I found myself…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Living in the dorms in college provided a great chance to see desperate women needing to pee. My freshman year I lived in a dorm named Brandon Hall and consisted of three buildings. Brandon Hall 1, 2 &amp; 3. Brandon Hall 1 was the oldest of the three buildings and as such had communal bathrooms. 1st and 2nd floors were female floors and 3rd and 4th floors were male. Brandon 2 and 3 were both made up of suites with a bathroom between each two rooms. Brandon 2 was co–ed and Brandon 3 was all female. As a Freshman I lived on the forth floor of Brandon 1. There were two guys to a room and in the middle of the middle of the floor on one side of the hall was a large communal bathroom– 6 stalls, 6 urinal, 6 showers and…</p>

        <p class="card-text">As I mentioned in some of my other stories, I lived in the dorms in college. It was cheap and it was one of the best damn times I&#039;ve ever had. And it is the only time I have ever witnessed mass desperation by an entire floor of women. If you have read my other stories, then you are aware that in my freshman year I lived in a dorm that had communal bathrooms and that the floors were segregated. One of the things we did on the 4th floor &quot;ZOO&quot; was to adopt the 2nd floor girls as our sister floor. Through the course of the year we did service projects together, planned parties together and just socialized a great deal. We also played practical jokes on each other, all the time.

        <p class="card-text">The ride had been long, hot and dusty across the Painted Desert of the American southwest in my 60 Chevy Impala convertible. Jackie and I had left for home after an early morning breakfast that included a lot of coffee and juice. We choose to go west for spring break instead of the typical Florida or Padre Island thing that most college kids choose, as we both loved the desert and had friends in Palm Springs. As we drove along that stretch of deserted blacktop, listening to music on the radio, we talked and kept drinking away at a cooler of cokes that we had purchased. A couple of hours into the desert, having long passed the last remnants of civilization, or at least a gas station with a bathroom, I noticed…</p>

        <p class="card-text">When I was in college I lived in the dorms on campus. I just couldn&#039;t afford not to. You see, I grew up farming and ranching and I am very good with my hands. My sophomore year at college, the Dorm system I lived in consisted of three buildings that needed a new maintenance man as the last one had graduated. The dorms and the college in general tried to give as many jobs as they could to the students to give them extra money. Of course if there were any major construction or re–construction going on, the physical plant personnel would come fix the problem. But for basic closet door repair, painting and the like, I was able to handle. In return I got my room and board for free as a member of staff, which was…</p>

        <p class="card-text">A few years ago I worked part–time as a bartender in a strip club. It was easy work, the money was good and the scenery was great. One Wednesday afternoon around 6:00 or so I was quietly tending bar when the owners of a little mom and pop company that supplied the machines for the bathrooms came in. Not only did they supply the condom and tampon machines; they also took care of the electric air fresheners in each bathroom. It was a good time for them to be there as the after work crowd had thinned and the evening crowd had not arrived yet. The bathrooms were right across from the bar and they had been in the women&#039;s bathroom for a few minutes when one of the employees came out and told me that they would be in…</p>

I won&#039;t go into what happened that evening as for one it was between Stacey and I and secondly, it has nothing to do with pee. It&#039;s enough for you to know that it was a great evening, and one that I will never forget. As I woke up the next morning, Stacey was curled up in the crook of my arm contently sleeping. That was great, and I gazed on her beautiful face. However, I couldn&#039;t gaze long for I needed the ever–necessary morning piss. I quietly slipped out of bed and walked into the bathroom for a leak. I was so preoccupied with getting ready to take much–needed piss I didn&#039;t even hear Stacey come up behind me.
