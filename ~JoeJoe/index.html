        <p class="card-text">This story was told to me by a friend who attends a small college of about 1200 students: I lived in the biggest dorm of all of them. It was an all female dorm and there were 50 of us living there. It was the oldest dorm on campus and originally the only one. Since it had been built for far fewer students many rooms had been converted into living quarters, leaving only one toilet for all 50 of us.
Weekday mornings were the worst. I would wake up with that full feeling in my bladder just bursting to go, never knowing how long the line at the toilet would be. It was unfortunately in the same room as the shower, which made waiting times even longer since girls would go in there and shower and pee and brush every…</p>

        <p class="card-text">We were watching two 3–year–old girls. It was a hot summer day so we (my friend and I) had each had three 22 OZ. cokes. About half an hour later I began to feel the urge to pee. I ignored it and figured we would be leaving soon. About 45 minutes later my urge was getting to a state of emergency so I figured we had better get going. I told the two girls it was time to go and they started crying and begging to stay. Marcy, my friend, said, &quot;Oh come on just let them play a bit more!&quot; I figured I&#039;d wait.
Another 20 minutes went by. I was in urgent need now of a place to pee. I knew that even if we left then with the walking speed of those kids we wouldn&#039;t be home for at least 30 minutes. It was a last resort, but…</p>

        <p class="card-text">I&#039;m 18 years old, female, and a senior in high school. I have a story I think would fit nicely on your page.
It was Friday night and I had a track meet the next morning as I usually did on Saturday mornings. I went to bed at about 11 o&#039;clock since my meet started at 9 AM and I was in the first event, so with the hour traveling time I needed to get up at about 7:30. I went to bed, and since it was a Friday night, went into a really deep sleep.
When I woke up the first thought that came to my mind was: &quot;I really have to pee!&quot; since I hadn&#039;t gone all night it was time for my morning piss. Then all of a sudden I looked at the clock and realized I had forgotten to set my alarm. The time was now 8:10 and I was…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Lately I&#039;ve been staying up late and so I have two cups of coffee every morning and then go for my daily pee around 10:00 when I have a free period. Sometimes I have trouble waiting that long, but I can&#039;t leave a class to use the bathroom and so that&#039;s my only option.
Last Wednesday happened to be one of those days which I wasn&#039;t having the easiest of times waiting. By 9:30 I was almost bursting and still had half an hour to go! I crossed my legs tightly and stuck my hand in my crotch, fairly certain I could hold on.
After what felt like an eternity the bell finally rang. I leaped up and ran to the bathroom. I turned the knob and the door was locked! A tiny spurt of pee shot out into my panties just out of…</p>
