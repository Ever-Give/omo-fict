        <p class="card-text">I have loved watersports, especially wetting myself, since I was about 13. It is good to come across a site with others! I saw a few stories there, and though I could tell you heaps, here is one that happened last month...
I decided to leave work early to do some shopping – my job allows for that kind of thing. Because it is important to what happened, I was in a full body suit, stockings, shortish shirt and blouse. I had drunk a bit at lunch (a going away party) and was a little tipsy too...
It was walking around one of the department stores that I realised I desperately needed to pee. I guess I had been holding it for a while, but now it was a need. I had also just drank a large coke to try and &quot;pep me up,…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Well today was an interesting day. I have been really busy in meetings and such, and have drunk a bit of coffee – but had no time for the loo! I finally got out of one meeting before lunch, and was bursting so bad it hurt – I am amazed I had not peed myself yet.
I raced by my desk to grab my purse and then the problem started – the fire alarm went off. We were advised to immediately evacuate our floor because of a &quot;possible fire&quot; on the level above me. I am on level 18, so it is a long walk! I also could not go and pee because the toilets were the opposite direction from the fire stairs, and they were pushing people out...
I finally got downstairs with a few little runs, and then they &quot;directed&quot; us to the…</p>

She stepped into her tailored, powder blue skirt, pulling it up and fastening the zip. It was going to be warm at the wedding and she decided to dispense with the blouse and donned her matching jacket, buttoning it over the swell of her full breasts and the delightfully deep cleavage created by her lacy half bra. Blue court shoes and a broad brimmed straw hat with long, trailing ribbon completed her wedding ensemble. She stood in front of the long mirror in her bedroom, smoothing down the short, straight skirt and liked what she saw: at 36 she was looking good – her waist still…</p>

When they left the club Lucy deliberately avoided going to the toilet even though she needed to go.They walked hand in hand along the main street soaking up the spring sunshine, occasionally stopping to look in shop windows, and Lucy was making no secret of the fact that she needed to pee. She was on the point of suggesting that they go round one of the quiet back streets, where because she had no panties on she could just stand open legged and piss on the ground. The…</p>

I picked one whose only occupant was a good–looking blond. I asked if she minded me sitting next to her, she shook her head and I took that to mean, please yourself.I settled down, nursing my scotch and water and pulled out my newspaper, turning to the sports pages. I tried to see if there was at lest one nag that hadn&#039;t let me down, it didn&#039;t look good, I began to feel more depressed. Then suddenly I got the feeling I was being watched.

Anything in public however is off limits, I am much too self–conscious to ever try it outside, and always go to the bathroom before any emergency arises. This day however was different. On the way back from class I stopped for gas and bought myself a large cappuccino, getting ready for a long afternoon of studying for midterms before going out with friends that night. As I sat down to study, I quickly downed the drink, hoping for a burst of energy, as I had gotten very little sleep the past week.

I wrote a story round it, and made it the second episode in my &quot;Linda&#039;s accidents&quot; series.
