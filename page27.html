        <p class="card-text">Remember my trip out to Indiana? Well, it takes just as long to drive back home again.
After we got off the bikes we decided to stay the night in town, getting up early the next morning to start the drive home, though we were still gonna split the drive into 2 days. We were in no rush to return to the real world. We were much more interested in playing. We&#039;re good at that.
So the next morning we hit the road. First stop – breakfast.
We&#039;d ridden our bikes over hundreds of miles of hills and eaten our way across an entire state and back again... but we were hungry. We pull into a Cracker Barrel (shoving aside several cars in an effort to find a parking place) and I headed for the door.
Mind you, it&#039;s early…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Returning home at five thirty, Anne stripped off, throwing her blouse, damp skirt, and sodden knickers into the laundry basket. Lighting a couple of scented candles she ran herself a warm, soothing bath with plenty of foamy bubble bath in it. After the day she&#039;d had, she definitely needed to pamper herself a little. She wasn&#039;t bitter or angry about what had happened – neither did she feel any self–reproach. Since the events of lunchtime she&#039;d had plenty of opportunity to pause and reflect. The painful, unpleasant, and humiliating experience of tumbling on the office stairs and wetting herself in front of Clive had actually helped her to clarify and resolve matters of which she&#039;d been aware for some weeks but…</p>

        <p class="card-text">As promised, here&#039;s my next posting in the &quot;Sarah&quot; series. I&#039;ve researched this carefully this evening and the timings seem about right. I was loading the washing machine after 90 minutes this evening, but I already had a cup of tea and a beer inside me when I started. Read on – you&#039;ll see what I&#039;m going on about!
Once again, this is pure fantasy, sadly there is no Sarah, and all events are fictitious.
After our experiences on the beach, I couldn&#039;t wait to find out what Sarah had in mind for a holding on contest. I had to wait until we got home, because she said what she had planned would be far too messy to contemplate in the B&amp;B we had been staying at in Cornwall.

        <p class="card-text">I eventually got into the habit of mostly holding on all day at school and not going to the toilet. I think this probably started from spending so much time with the boys. While girls often tend to go to the toilet together, boys are much more haphazard. For example, if we were in the middle of a game of cricket or something during lunch time we&#039;d keep playing as long as we possibly could after the bell rang, and only when it was too late to go would I realize I really could have done with a visit to the toilet. The only acceptable option then would be to just hold on for the rest of the afternoon, which I always managed to, refusing to ask to be excused during class. Having always been quite a tomboy I was…</p>

        <p class="card-text">From my last story you already know of my former friend, whom I called my Bladder Queen. Here is a new – real story of how she tried to find her limits.
My lovely &quot;Bladder Queen&quot; was a tourist guide who rode in double–decker sight seeing busses. We were in love and a couple for a few years. She often waited way too long and then (deliberately) would be shivering with her legs, to hold it a little easier. But she just did this when we both were at home. Outside she never showed any (visible) sign of her often really urgent need to pee. When she got really desperate in public, she just whispered into my ear that she could not hold it any longer. But my friend never wet her panties, not even when desperately…</p>

Clive, her boss, was throwing work at her from all directions and it was proving difficult to keep up, let alone maintain a sense of composure. She paused momentarily, draining the last drops of coffee in her cup – the fourth she&#039;d had that morning. Excessive though it was, she needed all those infusions of caffeine, a necessity just enabling her to keep going, especially as the week was ending and fatigue was starting to set in.

We had weekly assemblies, all standing in the open assembly area, just before lunchtime. My mates and I usually tried to stand behind a row of girls so we could check them out. I particularly enjoyed studying the shape of their bottoms under their uniforms and imagining I could see right through to their pants. One day in an assembly I found myself particularly transfixed by an extremely attractive girl in front and just across to the left.

31st December 1999, and the prospect of the biggest party either of us had ever seen had Sarah and myself traveling south to London to join in the fun. We decided that the best policy would probably be to leave the car well outside the city center and take a train to Waterloo; so early in the evening we left the car at Feltham and continued our journey by rail.

There was a sale going on and I wanted to get a couple of blouses and a skirt that had been advertised, so I first went to get them, but when I got to the car with my purchases I decided there was no reason to head for home and I might as well take a wander around.
I must have spent an hour or so wandering up and down the mall, checking out different stores and finally stopping to get a cup of coffee. For a while I just sat and watched the people go by, wondering about their stories and making up stories to go with their…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Kari was a beautiful young girl just out of high school. She had always been incredibly shy, but her smile more than made up for it. After moving away to college she desperately needed a job to pay her bills, but in a college town, jobs can be hard to come by. She wore a tight fitting red blouse, tight khaki pants, and white cotton panties.
After a long day of tedious interviews, Kari was walking back to her dorm when she realized she had far too much to drink on her lunch break. Being new in town she did not know of anywhere she could just stop in to use the rest room, plus she figured, &quot;I&#039;m a grown adult, I&#039;ll be fine.&quot;
Her pace became quicker on the way back to her dorm as she realized she REALLY had to…</p>

        <p class="card-text">I had the most exciting experience with a big bladdered woman some years ago. I found a new love with a fascinating woman for a longer time.
This two–part story really happened some years ago and I have NOT elaborated or changed any of the described facts!
I won&#039;t tell you her name, but she was a slim and sporty woman of 32 years at the time and had very long, dark, brown hair. She was very beautiful, and had a fascinating smile– and she had the best–trained, incredibly massive, persistent bladder that I have ever found. She was very tough and had really strong nerves– a fascinating woman also possessing many other good qualities but that&#039;s not the theme of this water sports community.

        <p class="card-text">This is a true story.
My 2nd cousin Julia, myself, and other family and friends met up at the cemetery for the funeral of an aged great Aunt. It was not a sad event; she was over 90, but a chance to remember her life. It was a cool but nice bright January day, I saw Julia standing near the Chapel entrance, so I went over to say hello. She is 29, tall, slim, hazel eyes with mousy hair tied up. We exchanged a few words and she asked if I had been there before.
I said I had, so she asked if I knew if there was a toilet near by, as she badly needed to take a leak. I said I had used a men&#039;s room last time, which was in the basement down steps outside around the back, so I guessed that there would be a ladies&#039;…</p>
