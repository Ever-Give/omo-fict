        <p class="card-text">So, I left you with my last experience with Casey. We had finally got a couple of things out in the open. She knew how turned on I was at the sight of her desperation. I knew how much she wanted to see me in a similar situation. 
A week or so after my experience with her she was hanging out at my apartment when somehow the topic came up. Casey expressed the interest of getting me into a situation where she could get me desperate to go. She said the ultimate goal was to see me soak myself. I was a bit turned on by the idea. I have previously written about a situation I had with a good friend of mine, Brooke, last Christmas when we had both wet ourselves. That turned into a pretty orgasmic situation. So I knew…</p>

        <p class="card-text">When I was a student I spent some time on an exchange scheme in Germany and part of this time was spent in Berlin. One day our group was taken on a coach tour of East Berlin. We set off at 8.00, right after breakfast in the hostel canteen. I was pleased to find that I was sitting next to Daniella, a pleasantly rounded Dutch girl who I had noticed before. She filled her skin–tight jeans to perfection, and the outline of her low–cut 1&quot; knickers was clearly visible. Her T–shirt showed she was not wearing a bra. We chatted away freely as we passed through the checkpoint and into the Eastern Zone. We started talking in German, as we were supposed to, but Daniella soon asked me to use English as she was much more…</p>

        <p class="card-text">When I was in college I lived in the dorms on campus. I just couldn&#039;t afford not to. You see, I grew up farming and ranching and I am very good with my hands. My sophomore year at college, the Dorm system I lived in consisted of three buildings that needed a new maintenance man as the last one had graduated. The dorms and the college in general tried to give as many jobs as they could to the students to give them extra money. Of course if there were any major construction or re–construction going on, the physical plant personnel would come fix the problem. But for basic closet door repair, painting and the like, I was able to handle. In return I got my room and board for free as a member of staff, which was…</p>

She was squirming and wiggling. &quot;I can&#039;t believe you just peed in my car,&quot; I said. I tugged her tiny dress up exposing her panties. I could see her crotch was moist and still dripping. &quot;Goddamn it, I can&#039;t believe you just pissed in my car. And look at you, wet panties and all.&quot; Her back was arched, her butt sticking out, grinding in mid–air. &quot;I couldn&#039;t help it,&quot; she said whining, &quot;I have to pee so bad it hurts!&quot; &quot;Hold still…</p>

Episode 3 – &#039;Till Wet do us Part
Laurie&#039;s jeep stopped with screaming tires at her sorority dorm. The door on the passenger side swung open immediately, and Kitty jumped out; her jeans were thoroughly soaked, she had already peed in her pants on two separate occasions but her bladder still wasn&#039;t empty – and her need remained. She took a few steps towards the dorm, but then looked back to see what was keeping the others. Laurie was helping Cathy, who was still crying and sobbing –as she had been all through the drive over here–, out of the car. She was trembling, clothed in nothing but a soiled T–shirt and her soaking wet panties. &quot;Will you hurry up!&quot; Kitty screamed, &quot;I still…</p>

At the end of the school day, her bladder was already feeling it. Through the orthodontist appt., she was squirming the whole time. By the time it was dinner, she couldn&#039;t imagine making it till about 10:30, the end of the movie.

Time to get out of business clothes and ponder the possibilities. She removed her dark blue jacket and skirt, unbuttoned her blouse, and enjoyed moving about wearing tights, panties and bra. For some reason hotel rooms made her feel erotic. Could be the undressing in strange quarters, knowing there were people behind the walls; maybe the dominating, inviting double bed; maybe the chance to meet someone in the bar or restaurant. She touched the nylon roundness of her belly, conscious of a need to relieve herself. She smiled, recalling stories of peeing in hotel beds. She had done…</p>

Miss Anderson was around thirty and usually dressed in proper skirt and blouse, with her auburn hair tied into a bun. Still, she was the object of my fantasies, being a woman who took me seriously, as opposed to the girls of my own age, who were either plain and giggly or pretty and condescending. She was petite, about my height at that time, and the decent clothes did not hide her womanly shape. I kept my dreams a secret for four years.

I had a few close calls during junior high and high school, where I leaked a little into my panties, but nothing that anyone noticed. One of my most memorable experiences happened in college. I went to a small private school that was out in the middle of nowhere. During my junior year, I took summer classes so I could graduate one semester early. One Saturday in late July, one of the student groups organized a day trip to an amusement park that was about 150 miles away. They chartered a bus, and we left at 9:00 o&#039;clock in the morning.

        <p class="card-text">From the time Nancy was nine years old she had accompanied her father on fishing trips.
In fact the whole family occasionally went along and they picnicked. Nancy&#039;s father was an avid fly fisherman and since Nancy was like all young daughters she wanted to engage in her fathers favorite pastime. When she was thirteen she was an accomplished fly fisherman. By the time she reached fourteen, her parents had divorced. Nancy was sent to live with her mother. She was devastated; she loved being with her Dad. After that, she was only able to see him sporadically, due to school and his work schedule. 
One Friday evening after Nancy had reached the age of eighteen her father called and asked if she wanted to go trout…</p>

        <p class="card-text">The visiting team had won and now they were boarding the bus for the two–hour trip home. Also the cheer leading team and other fans that had gotten permission to ride the school bus to the game were boarding for the return trip home. The fact that their team had won sort of threw the schedule and pre–boarding activities out of kilter. Nancy danced and pranced around the boarding area congratulating each of the team members as they boarded their special bus. She ignored the fact that her dancing and prancing concealed a need to void her bladder. 
When the team was boarded it was announced that the fans and cheerleaders would have to board also as they were to return caravan style. Nancy boarded one of the two…</p>

        <p class="card-text">The minivan pulled up in the parking lot, packed full of stuff. Looked like the annual ritual of moving your child off to college. Hurriedly, she closed the passenger door of her Mom&#039;s minivan quickly, hopping out to the ground, yelling at her mother to hurry. Knees knocked together, the girl was in a panic. &quot;Mom, hurry up!&quot; she yelled, &quot;I really gotta go to the bathroom, come on, let&#039;s go inside before I have an accident right here!&quot; I had just pulled into the parking lot, ready to grab some lunch and I had to use the bathroom pretty badly myself. It was a long drive down I–95, and I hadn&#039;t relieved myself in a few hours and my black leggings were starting to fit snug against my body as my bladder swelled. It…</p>

        <p class="card-text">The elevator door opened and Ashley walked with hesitant steps into the opulent headquarters of Rainwater &amp; Associates firmly clutching her resume, her immaculately tailored dark blue skirt and jacket, expensive white blouse and high heel pumps– the outfit de rigueur for the position of executive secretary she hoped to land. Her long flowing locks of red hair had been tied back and expertly braided, all giving what she hoped was a professional persona that belied her twenty one years. Ushered into the sanctum of the inner office, she sat nervously as L.P. Rainwater, the founder and CEO studied every line of her application. Finally the CEO from central casting looked up and took his reading glasses off. …</p>
