He finds out Louise wets whenever she pleases, because after making love she is sitting on the couch in a pair of spandex shorts with her legs crossed. She doesnt even let Jim know she is about to let go. Suddenly he hears a load hiss as she is leaving a huge puddle of piss in his couch. He askes Louise what she is doing and she says "what do you think"?

"I'm Pissing, Just had to go"!

He says thats cool but from now on he would like to be told when she is about to let loose so he can prepare the receiving surface so not to ruin any furniture. Several seconds later she is finished pissing and stands up to see her deed. The couch has a huge round circle of wetness in the light tan cloth, she says it should dry OK and if not she will replace the cushion for Jim. Jim says to Louise that he has always wanted to meet a girl that pissed whenever and where ever she wanted and is happy with her!!!!
