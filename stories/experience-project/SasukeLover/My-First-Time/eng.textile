I'm not good with adding details unless it's happening to me right when I'm typing, so please bare with me

Okay, so I decided to have a little fun yesterday and hold my pee in all day, or until I wet myself. I'm not much of a big fan on wetting, so at the last moment I normally make a mad dash for the toilet. 

So I skipped my morning pee and went through about 12 hours of complete bladder torture. I drank about 5 cups of water, 2 cups of tea. And a cup of coffee throughout the day and all that liquid made it's way down to my bladder in about a 2 hour period. 

After about ten hours of holding, I swear I was about to explode! My poor bladder was weak and I couldn't hold anymore. I was dry the whole time, but when I ran to the toilet, I was spurting like crazy. As I pulled my jeans down, I stared at the toilet, then the shower. Without knowing it, I took off my jeans(they were new and I didn't want to ruin then) and put on an old pair of shorts and stepped in the shower. It took a few seconds to get the flow started, but when it did...Oh my god, it felt amazing!! It first came out slowly at first, but then all the pee just rushed out my bladder. It was so warm and lasted about a good for minutes.
