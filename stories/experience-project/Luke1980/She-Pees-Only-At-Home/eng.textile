My girfrind is one of that girls that pee only in her bathroom: she is lucky because she has a giant bladder.

She told me she never peed at school, she always held untill home at 16 even when she was young. The first period she always arrived at home with full and hurting bladder but now she pees in the morning and then when she goes sleep.

When we had a week end in house of our friends she doesn't pee even before sleeping or in the morning. She hold untill she arrives at her home: 36-40 hours without a pee, with hurting bladder for hours and hours

Amasing for me!!!!

need2go - 18-21 years old: No way could I hold it that long! And I wonder if doing so on a regular basis could have negative effects. If it hurts, it isn't good. 

luke1980 - 26-30 years old - male: normally she doesn't have any problem to hold from morning till night. Her bladder hurts if she holds more then 24....and it's not so often!!! 

holdit247 - 31-35 years old - male: I need a girlfriend like that!
