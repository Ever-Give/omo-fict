Plans For A Volume Hold

Thanks to EP members I have become intrigued by the idea of holding and measuring my output, and am hoping to do so soon. However, I need tips!

Particularly asking holdit247 and fetishguru who inspired me :P

Yesterday I went out to a friend's house. I was there for about 4 or 5 hours and drank quite a lot. I was trying to wait until I got home [to have some fun] but due to being with people and therefore not having the luxury of holding myself or anything, I ended up having to go. I nearly made the full five hours, but right before I left I just had to give in.

Anyway, I went to the toilet and I swear, had THE longest pee of my life.

So now breaking the seal actually has a meaning for me!

I was honestly surprised how much I had manged to hold, because it was so much that it felt like I normally wouldn't have had the capacity - I know I've been more desperate than I was then, and peed less from it.

So I have to take that into account when I do this hold.

I have been advised to wear less clothes to reduce pressure on my bladder. Any more tips? E.g. when, where, what to drink, etc

I want to do this well! When I do it I will of course report back on EP with a story and pictures ;)

Thanks!
