Mom Calls.. Bladder Bursts
	(16-17 year old woman)
Posted by BladderBurst

I was having a holding contest with myself ALL day! So as you can imagine, I was absolutely BURSTING for a wee! I was still trying to hold myself, and it took both my hands and my thighs clamped together to hold the urine in. My bladder hurt, but I was downstairs and couldn't tell if I was going to make it upstairs. I unsteadily got up off the couch and stumbled out of the room, both hands between my legs. The bathroom was upstairs and down the hall. I couldn't properly hold myself, so I pulled my pants off. I walked close to the stairs, bending over to stop the pain, but it made me spurt through my fingers clamped tightly around it. I had to rest. I sloped down and sat face forward against the wall, the corner digging into my peehole. It helped a bit, but I felt the warmess on my butt, since I was still sitting down. I stood up ubrubtly, ******* my bladder, but managed to grab hold just in time. 

Unfortunatley, sone urine escaped my fingers. Now I just had to tackle the stairs. Each step was agony, spurting a little as I went. I was well the way up the stairs, when my mom called! "Hello-o" my voice was shaky. Anyways, she went on with some long conversation, but I just kept saying "uh-huh" unable to pay any attention, I said "Mo-mom. Uh I gotta go ok bye! And I hung up. Suddenly, I was flooding my pants, so I ran up the stairs and peed for 3 minutes! It felt great. Please comment!
