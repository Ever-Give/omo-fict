Hey my fellow EP users, sorry I haven't written a story in a while. I've been dying to share another experience, but I was busy with school. Anyway, here's the story of how Blake and I tried to beat the holding record of twenty-eight hours.

"Good morning." Blake said as I rose from bed on Saturday morning at ten. "Morning," I yawned. "Wanna try and beat the record today?" He asked. It had been a month since our last attempt, in which I suceeded, and he failed. "Totally. Begin at Noon again?" I asked. "Yeah." He said.

Once again I pee'd at 11:59, making sure there was no liquid left in my body. He did the same.

We stayed around the house all day. I was upset when I realized that I already had to pee at about nine. I decided to go to bed, you can't feel the need when your sleeping. I started to walk towards the bedroom. "Where are you going?" Blake asked. "Bed, I already have to go." I said. "Same here, maybe sleeping will help." He said. I nodded and we went into the bedroom. 

As he changed into just his boxers, I looked under my shirt to see my bladder already visibly swollen, and I was already desperate. I knew my chances of makin it until 4 the next day were slim. As he ot into bed, he noticed the bump on my abdomen. "Wow, you really have to go that bad?" He asked. I sighed, "Yeah." 

I was sweating and restless, but I found a comfortable position that let up on some of the pressure, and I fell asleep.

I shockingly woke up barley feeling the urge at all. For Blake it appeared the oppisite, his need was always the worst in the morning. He wasn't holding himself, but was rocking back and forth slowly on the bed. "You okay?" I asked. "Yeah, I think i'll make it this time." He said. 

As I got out of bed, the insane urge immediatley returned and I fell to my knee's. I quickly held myself. Today was not the day I was breaking the record. I looked down at my tank top. It looked like I was pregnant, my bladder was so swollen. I was in pain. This couldn't be good for me. I decided to give in and try again another time. As I tried to stand up, my bladder spasmed and I began to wet myself. I couldn't beileve it. I had gone much longer than this before, and I usually had more control. But I literally had no control as I flodded my shorts and the carpet of my bedroom.

I moaned in reilefe and pleasure. When my bladder was halfway empty, I was finally able to stop and crawl to the bathroom as I held myself desperatley. But I lost control again before I even made it to the toilet. I gave up and laid on the bathroom tile, I had never felt reilefe so good. I closed my eyes. I could feel the puddle underneath me growing larger and larger. I pee'd for two minutes, after my bladder was already half empty. 

When I was finished, I opened my eyes. I saw Blake standing over me, shocked. I blushed in embaressment, I usually didn't get embarressed when it came to wettings, but I had litteraly had no control of my bladder. I wet myself in my bedroom by accident. "Sorry." I managed to say. "Why would you be sorry? That was the hottest thing i've ever seen." He said. "Seriously?" I asked. "Yeah, seeing you lose it by accident! I couldn't breathe while I watched. We need to have sex right now." He said and laughed lightly. 

He reileved himself, and while he did I began to kiss him. He was still going as I dragged him away from the toilet and into the bedroom. 

By the time we were finished, the bed, the bathroom, the carpet, everything was drenched. "Well that was a fail." He said and laughed. "Why? That was the best sex ever." I said. "No, I mean our record attempt." He said. "Oh, true. We'll break the record one day." I said. "I honestley love you Sarah." He said suddenley. "I love you too." I said.
