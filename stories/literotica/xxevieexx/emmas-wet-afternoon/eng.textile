Emma's Wet Afternoon
	Emma finds other ways to get "wet."
Author: xxevieexx

As I got out of the car, I sprinted to the house. When I reached the front step and extended my hand to turn the knob, I almost ran right into the door. It was locked. I knocked. I pounded. I stood, legs crossed and half doubled over in pain. If I didn't get to a bathroom soon, I was going to pee my pants.

I rummaged around inside my purse trying to find my house key. I felt tears forming as the panic set in. I couldn't find it. I turned it upside down and dumped everything out right there on the front step. It wasn't anywhere to be found.

I bit my lip as I looked around. No cars were in the neighbors driveways. I looked up and down the street, no cars. No one walking their dog. No kids riding their bicycles. I looked over to the corner of our yard where the big Oak tree was. I couldn't believe what I was contemplating.

As my bladder overflowed, I felt a small trickle down my leg and knew I didn't really have a choice. It was either go behind the tree or pee my pants. A little wet spot was one thing, but soaking wet was quite another.

"Ok, here goes," I thought to myself. I bent over to collect my things and put them back into my backpack. The pressure of bending over caused a little more pee to escape. I clamped my thighs together and began hobbling across the yard. Once I reached the Oak tree, I moved behind it and checked all directions. The coast was clear.

I lifted up my uniform and pulled my panties to the side. I squatted down and with watchful eyes, emptied my exploding bladder on to the grass. I could hear the loud hissing sound as I pissed all over the ground.

A large puddle was forming, and I could feel some splashing up onto my ankles. The relief was so great that I felt lightheaded. I couldn't believe how bad I had to go and wondered when it was going to stop. I actually started to smile a bit when I realized how long I had been squatting there.

Once the powerful stream subsided and turned to a trickle, I began to shake my bottom back and forth trying to shake off any last drops. I pulled my panties back over and stood up, smoothing out my skirt. I noticed how wet they were from the first two accidents and adding to it, the wetness left from my pissing behind the tree.

I walked across the yard as I thought about what I had just done. At first I felt disgusted by what I had done, but what choice did I have? Pee my pants? As I thought about that, I realized how much I enjoyed the feeling of having wet panties.

"What is wrong with me?" I thought. I could feel my face get warm and my heart began to pound a little.

"What the hell? Why am I getting turned on now?" I asked myself. Suddenly, I remembered that my roommate had said she was working late tonight, which explains why the door was locked.

"Shit. How am I going to get in now?" I wondered. I looked around and decided to try my neighbor, John, across the street. We had given him a key a few months ago in case of emergency.

I quickly walked across the street and knocked on his door. A moment later, he opened the door, smiling. I asked him if he still had our key because I was locked out. He said yes and invited me in while he looked for it. He went into the kitchen and I could hear him rummaging around in one of the drawers.

"Would you like something to drink Emma? Your face is all red, you look like you've been outside for hours."

"Water would be good, thanks!" I answered, wondering why I was still blushing.

When John came in and handed me the glass of water, I noticed he had a big bulge in the front of his pants. He must have seen me looking because he just stood there watching me while I hid behind my glass of water. I didn't want him to stare at me, so I continued to drink the water so I could hide behind the glass.

"You WERE thirsty! Would you like another?" he asked. I cleared my throat and looked down at the floor. I played with my sock so I didn't have to make eye contact with him and told him yes, I would like more to drink.

I was so relieved when he walked out of the room, but that didn't last long. He returned in what seemed like only seconds with another glass of water. He stood directly in front of me as I sat on the couch and drank my water. I could see through the glass that the bulge I thought I had seen was not only there, but was now very prominent.

"Like what you see?" he asked. I almost choked and water came spewing out of my mouth. "Hmmm, that's the second time in five minutes I've seen you squirt water out of your body like that." My heart pounded in my chest and my head spun. "Oh my God. Did he just say what I think he said? Oh my GOD. Did he see me?" My mind raced with these thoughts and I began to panic. I looked up at him and he was grinning from ear to ear.

"Don't worry, I won't tell anyone." I felt a wave of relief wash over me. It was short lived, however, because John dropped his hand down to the bulge in his pants. My heart started pounding again.

"I won't tell anyone, IF you do something for me," he grinned, rubbing his cock through his shorts. I figured he was hinting at a blow job. I was not normally one to shy away from an opportunity like this, but it just seemed strange. He was my neighbor!

Instead, he said "I want to watch you piss, Emma."

"WHAT?" I croaked out.

"That's right. I want to watch you squat down and piss for me. And as you piss noisily, I am going to stroke my big fat cock." While contemplating the situation, my mind wandered to my pee soaked panties and I noticed a new dampness that wasn't there before. I realized that the thought of pissing in front of someone was making my pussy wet.

"OK. I'll do it," I said. He held out his hand and I took it. Instead of leading me into the bathroom, he brought me into his kitchen. He patted the counter and said "Up". I jumped up and sat on the counter.

"No, no, no. I want you to squat for me. Up on your feet, my little pee girl," he instructed. I did what I was told and he brought over a martini glass, placing it directly under my pussy.

He stood back and pulled his cock out of his pants. It was purple and dripping wet. I could see how turned on this was making him, so I decided to enjoy it. I pulled up my skirt and pulled my panties down just a bit. I felt my face burn as he saw the wet panties.

He let out a soft groan and began fucking his cock into his hand. I opened up my cunt lips and bit my lip. I began to push and within a few seconds, I was pissing for him. I was squatting on my neighbors counter pissing into a martini glass and he was masturbating his monster cock to the sight of it.

"How did I get here?" I asked myself. Then, I realized that I didn't care. I actually liked pissing for him. In fact, I LOVED it. I loved that he was watching me urinate. I love that he called me his little pee girl, and I wanted to do it more.

When I noticed that the martini glass was overflowing on to the counter, I stopped short and decided to take the lead with this new game. I hopped off the counter and squatted right there on his kitchen floor. A yellow puddle began to form on the floor. Again, I stopped. His eyes were as big as saucers now as he realized what my plan was.

I walked into the living room and he followed â€“ cock in hand. I squatted down right in the middle of his living room and pissed on his carpet. When I was satisfied, I stood up and walked down the hall. As I walked, I pissed. I left a tinkle trail down his hall and went into the dining room. I pulled out one of the chairs and sat. I leaned back and spread my legs and pussy open. I pushed hard, and this time, a golden arch sprayed out of my pussy. I looked over at him and he was jacking his cock frantically. I could see giant drops of precum flying from his cock. I stood up, looked at my dining room pee stain and realized I was almost empty.

"Any preferences?" I asked him.

He lay down under me and said "Yeah, right here," and pointed to his cock. I stood over him and spread my pussy open.

"Ready John? Ready for your little pee girl to piss right onto your cock?" I asked him. He didn't reply, just stared at my pussy and pumped his cock. "One, two.....THREE!" I began pissing all over my neighbors cock. The moment he felt my hot liquid hit his cock, he shot off. Some landed on my leg, some actually reached my pussy and the rest just went up into the air and landed in various spots.

"Now it's my turn," he said. I found that the thought of getting pissed on was also tremendously exciting and wanted more than anything to be on the receiving end.

I got on my knees and knelt before him, arching my back. Within just a few seconds I felt his HOT piss splashing all over my tits. He aimed it at my pussy, my stomach, my tits, my legs, and my hair. By the time he was done, I was absolutely soaked.

My clit was pounding and I needed some relief. I brought my hand to my pussy and began rubbing myself.

"Up here" John said and pointed to the dining room table. I got on the table and he instructed me to get on my hands and knees and turn around. I did as I was told and without warning, he began ramming his fingers into my sopping wet pussy hole. I looked down and saw that little droplets of his piss were dripping off my body onto the table. I felt my pussy stretch open as he added two more fingers to his assault.

"You like that, you little piss slut?" he asked. I couldn't even talk. My head was spinning. I was covered in piss and begging for my cunt to be pounded. I nearly passed out when I came and collapsed when I was finished. When he finally pulled his hand out of my pussy, I felt empty. But, I loved it. I loved the whole experience.

I gathered my things, thanked John for giving me the key and headed back home. I went into the bedroom to start getting cleaned up, but as I walked past the mirror, the reflection caught my attention. My hair was wet and stringy, my eye makeup was smeared and my lipstick had been all but rubbed off. I looked beautiful. I continued to the bathroom and turned the shower on, smiling to myself, as I began replaying the afternoon's events in my mind.

It's funny how some days do not end up anything like you had expected them to.
