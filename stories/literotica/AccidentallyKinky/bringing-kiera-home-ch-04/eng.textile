AccidentallyKinky

Keira woke the next morning, and although her nappy was dry, her body flooded with shame at the memory of the night before. Her sobs had barely subsided as she had fallen into a bone-weary sleep, and this morning she was still swallowing some residual strangled whimpers.

Jamie pulled her tightly towards him, cupped one of her deliciously pert breasts and gently squeezed her nipple. Keira curved into his body as if melded to him and relaxed into the sensation. She flinched as Jamie reached down, put his hands inside her nappy, and mirroring his action on her nipple, pinched her erect clit.

As he pressed down on her pelvis, Keira felt an urgent need to pee.

"Jamie, stop, I gotta go."

"Don't worry about it, sweetheart," Jamie continued fucking her tight little cunt with his fingers, "you can go right here."

But although Kiera had fully embraced wearing her nappy in front of Jamie, and in some ways even enjoyed it, today she wanted nothing to do with it. She wanted no reminder of her accidents, her urination, and certainly no suggestion of her subsequent arousal.

"Not today, Jamie, please" she pleaded softly.

"Okay," he watched his defeated little girl make her way to the bathroom and felt terrible for his actions the night before. He wasn't sorry he'd done it, she needed to be taught, but he didn't want her to end up so sad, so miserable, so broken.

He waited a minute or two until he was sure she'd had time to remove her nappy and followed her into the bathroom. She was sitting on the toilet, her slender legs splayed in mid-pee.

"Jamie... what the hell... I'm right in the middle... get out," Keira closed her legs and clenched her muscles, trying to stop the flow mid-stream. It slowed to a trickle.

Jamie kneeled down in front of Keira "firstly, I've seen you pee in your nappy several times, this is no different, so unclench that little pussy of yours and finish peeing. Secondly, I'm not sorry I spanked you because this is how you'll learn, but I am sorry that you're this upset. That was not my intention. Please, darling, don't pull away from me."

"Perhaps if I wasn't concentrating so hard on not peeing in front of you right now, I could think more clearly," Kiera quipped, with a mere hint of a smile showing through her screwed-up little features as she desperately tried to hold back.

Jamie couldn't help but smirk "listen, darling, it's Friday, how about we both call in sick today and enjoy a long weekend together."

"We couldn't, could we?" Kiera speculated. They were both workaholics and needlessly taking a day off was unthinkable.

"Think about it; wasn't it Justin's tirade yesterday that set this whole thing in motion in the first place? Think of it as revenge," Jamie proposed, "and my office takes me for granted, perhaps if I missed a day, they'd appreciate what it is I do."

"Or they'll see that they can manage perfectly fine without you," Keira giggled, "but what the hell, I deserve a day off, and Justin can go fuck himself today. And now will you please leave so I can finish peeing."

Jamie stood up, "fantastic, I'm gonna call my office now, but," he grinned "I am not leaving this bathroom until you unclench that cute little cunt of yours and let go."

"Bastard," Keira laughingly grimaced, but she did as she was told and finished peeing while Jamie watched.
