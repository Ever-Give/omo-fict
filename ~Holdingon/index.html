        <p class="card-text">As some of you may know, I really enjoy frantic desperation– a man&#039;s or mine. Generally I do my monster holds at home as I have never wet myself as an adult and I can&#039;t imagine the public embarrassment. I have often wondered if I am really holding my maximum when I do this, as I know that the toilet and measuring jug are near by when I am home and full.
I decided to do something different today. I went to visit a friend about 300 miles away for the weekend. We had fun but frankly, it was a little boring. So this morning I decided to set a few rules for the trip– no stopping at all– and I must consume 12 oz. of liquid every half an hour. I also knew that as I became more and more desperate the feelings would…</p>

        <p class="card-text">It has been a long weekend and I am now a bit bored. Memories from last Sunday&#039;s monster hold make me feel warm and that makes me want to ride the piss wave of beautiful agony again. I was going to give my bladder a break but an opportunity came up so, I decide to try another hold. Not as long as last week, I know that I will never hold out at home like I did in the car. Having a toilet nearby is too much temptation for me. I am going to really push the fluid though – 20 ounces every half hour, 8 ounces more each half hour than last week&#039;s hold. Maybe it will fill me fuller, faster. Here are my notes.
