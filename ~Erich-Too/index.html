        <p class="card-text">&quot;Here&#039;s my expense report, Ms. DiPesto!&quot; said Henry. Erin Bouvier didn&#039;t even look up. She didn&#039;t appreciate the joke, since she didn&#039;t think she looked like Agnes DiPesto from Moonlighting. She did have very large eyes. There was, she supposed, some association. But she was also an odd duck. She liked period clothing. These days, she wore her salt and pepper hair in a wing cut. She favored wrap dresses, ribbed hose and ankle strap high heels. She told the curious she just liked different styles. She saw it in a magazine. Simple as that. Henry saw more, Henry liked her. While friends at work were always a bonus, she hoped he wouldn&#039;t act on it. He wasn&#039;t bad looking; she just never dated anyone from work.…</p>

He was a math professor at the nearby college. A soft spoken, grey haired man who walked to the campus mornings looking at the flowers, the birds in the trees, and saying hello to a friendly, older woman who gardened and paused in her sweaty endeavors to say hello to the friendly old guy who wore tweed jackets with patched elbows, who incongruously chose to live upstairs in the four apartment building at the end of a disheveled street where the kudzu threatened to take over again and turn everything back to the swamp it had once been.
Sometimes, he rode a bicycle. A large, black one with fat tires and a large,…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Many years ago, I lived in an apartment in Shreveport, Louisiana. I was a computer programmer at a hospital. I worked a lot of odd hours because the big computer, the mainframe, had to be up during business hours. I liked those odd hours because I could take time off during the week for college classes and lay out by the pool. I was young, and I drove a junky old car and my apartment was sparsely populated with junky old furniture. I did grunge when it was just called wearing used clothes from the Salvation Army. With no flash and hardly any cash at a time when men wore shirts open to the waist with gold chains and pointed while they danced, I didn&#039;t have too much of a social life, as you can imagine. My heap…</p>
