        <p class="card-text">It was a snowy Saturday afternoon during Winter break after Ramona&#039;s first semester in college. Her roommates, with whom she had been good friends with since childhood, had all travelled back home for the holidays. Ramona would be left all alone in their vast apartment for three lonely weeks. On this particular day Ramona found her self parked in front of the television, reclining on the couch and enjoying her first real free time in months. Her peace was shortly interrupted by the twinge of nature calling her to empty her bladder. Ramona thought about getting up, but her favorite show was on. It could wait for now. But somewhere in the back of her mind the twinging of her bladder brought back memories of…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Some people discover early on their proclivities towards watersports, but I came to mine when I was in college. I was on vacation in a resort town somewhere in the Pacific. I had just received my diving certification and was eager to get to it. Before I arrived I had booked several dives with a local company, and on the day of my &#039;discovery&#039; we were to make two dives, both along the reef wall. Of course I wouldn&#039;t be alone; five others had been booked in my group.
