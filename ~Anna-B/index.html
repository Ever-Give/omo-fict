        <p class="card-text">This story is fiction, although it is based on a real event that was mentioned to me a few years ago by a friend of the main character– whose name has been changed. The final outcome actually happened, but the rest of the story I have made up to fit credibly around it, based on what seems likely from what details I was told, and from various experiences of my own.
&quot;Okay, well I&#039;ll see you on Friday night,&quot; Kylie said to Dale, her new boyfriend. They gave each other a quick kiss then left the small inner–city park where they&#039;d met for lunch. Dale had to go back to work, but the rest of the afternoon was Kylie&#039;s to spend as she wished, as she had only casual work, and there would be no more for her for the rest…</p>
