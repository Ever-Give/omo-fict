        <p class="card-text">Although my wife doesn&#039;t really share my desperation fetish herself, she does aim to please me in that area sometimes when she is in a good mood. Recently however, she took my &quot;hobby&quot; out into the open for the first time, getting herself in real trouble in the process. My employer invited us to a concert. On the designated evening many colleagues arrived at the main office building, where we were led to the biggest conference room, which had been transformed to a concert hall with a proper stage for the occasion. Everyone looked at his or her best: the men in suits, the women wearing dresses or skirts, mostly short ones. Even the director&#039;s wife showed lots of leg and to be honest, had nothing to be ashamed…</p>

        <p class="card-text">I work at a medium–sized IT–development firm where we develop large–scale applications for other firms. Doing an intake for a new assignment starts with a visit to the customer by a technician and an account manager. 
When I was still a novice I was told to join Mrs. Carpenter in such an intake trip. Mrs. Carpenter was one of the top sales executives, but most of the men thought about her as the woman who knew how to dress. She always wore suits with skirts that never ended at or below the knee. She always walked on spike–heeled pumps. In the company&#039;s cafeteria, I used to admire her muscular, yet very feminine legs with bulging, rock–hard calves, which she always crossed in an equally feminine manner. Not…</p>

        <p class="card-text">In my days as a student, I earned a little extra as an assistant in a shoe store. One evening my boss had left me to mind the store on my own, because he had to attend some social thing with his wife. I had lost track of time, trying to work out the numbers for the day. I had been on my own in the store for some time when –just before closing time– a lady entered. She walked right up to the shoe racks and started looking at the shoes. I took a minute or two to look at her. She was in her late twenties or early thirties, not very tall with dark blonde, shoulder long hair. She was wearing a red sweater, a tight red spandex miniskirt and black pumps. She didn&#039;t wear nylons. Her legs were quite tanned and muscular…</p>
