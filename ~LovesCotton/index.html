        <p class="card-text">You&#039;re my Aunty Julie, and I have had a crush on you for a long time. I can remember watching you as a young teenage girl, when I spied you in the bathroom one day, watching you in your panties and bra in the bathroom. You didn&#039;t see me I think, but I was hiding in the bathroom closet from my younger sister, staring out through the louvers. I saw you looking at yourself in the mirror, admiring your curves that I had liked so much. Watching you admiring yourself turned me on so much!
I also noticed that you had damp panties, like you had recently accidentally wet yourself a little. I didn&#039;t know why, but I found the idea very arousing, and as my breath came is shuddering whispers my hand found its way slowly…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Hi. I have been lurking here for quite some time, and love all the stories. Then I thought I should post some of my memories, as I always thought other people were rude if they lurked and didn&#039;t play &quot;show &amp; tell!&quot; So here goes.
I grew up on a secluded New Zealand farm, very steep country, but lovely native forest with sparkling streams and rivers. This story is from my favorite place in the world! It is from early on in my wetting, back when it was more fun than sexual. I hope you like it.
I guess I first got interested in wetting my panties at an early age, too. I remember growing up on our farm, and a lot of the time I would be left to my own for long periods of time. Summer was the best time of the year.…</p>
