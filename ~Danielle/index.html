        <p class="card-text">Kristi, a 5&#039;5&quot; 22 year old girl, a friend of mine, is telling me what happened. This is something that happened only last month, on March 8th, 2004 in the Bay Area.
Kristi woke up, her normal routine, on a Thursday morning. She took a shower, dressed up in a skirt (it was an unusually warm weather, reaching 90 degrees just south of San Francisco), took a drink, and took a quick pee before heading out. Working at a Sprint store, which was only half a mile walk through some redwood trees, she got there, avoiding the sun as much as she could since she was feeling hot. She headed there, did her usual work, answering phone calls and helping customers, and drank some water. Quickly feeling her bladder fill up from…</p>

        <p class="card-text">This is a true story that happened to a woman named Jenny.
Jenny needed to pee. It wasn&#039;t an extremely urgent need (at least not yet, anyway), but it was enough to cause her some discomfort. She had been bagging groceries nonstop for the past 2 1/2 hours, and it wasn&#039;t even an hour and fifteen minutes into her shift that she began to feel that familiar sensation of painful pressure weighing down on her urethra. Jenny was an attractive Caucasian girl, with a slim body and shoulder–length dark blonde hair. But now her cute face was beginning to show the strain caused by the increasing heaviness in her bladder.
A customer noticed her furrowed brow and pursed lips and asked her if there was anything wrong.
&quot;Oh,…</p>

        <p class="card-text">My friend, Jade and I were off headed to an overnight party with some other friends but first, we went to a pub to drink since it was a hot day. We each had a full pitcher of beer and drank all of it. We ate a little and then we headed towards the bathroom because of recent problem that I had experienced. Jade said she did not need to go so I went by myself, peed quickly into the toilet and then left before even letting all of it out because we were in a hurry to get to the party, which was about an hour away There were BOYZ at the party. I got thirsty again and drank 4 more bottles of beer getting drunk. I knew that I was out of control but I finally sat down with a little help from Jade. She had also gotten…</p>

        <p class="card-text">First though, we had other plans– a party to go to. Michelle called to say she had to babysit and would be an hour late. So, Julie and I went to the party, which took thirty minutes to drive to.
Upon arriving at the party, we were both thirsty so we drank three bottles of beer apiece, along with five cups of lemonade. Michelle finally arrived and she drank another four bottles of beer. We were there for a total of two hours before we left to embark upon our camping trip. Everyone needed to use the restroom but it was so messy that we decided not to use it. Then we left.
Julie, our driver, told us it would take an hour to get to the camping spot as long as there wasn&#039;t a traffic problem. That sounded fine, we…</p>

        <p class="card-text">When school started three weeks ago, something funny came up. We had a pep rally on Friday for the senior class that extended our school day an extra hour and a half. Normally we finish at three o&#039;clock but that day we had to stay until four thirty in the afternoon.
It started off like any other day with our teacher, Ms. Jorgenson drinking her two cups of coffee. That day we had her the entire day as our teacher. After finishing her coffee, she started to teach, and then went outside for more coffee. She filled a thermos with three more cups of coffee and brought it back to class to drink while teaching.
At lunchtime, we were forced to eat inside due to rain, though some of us left in cars to go home or to…</p>
