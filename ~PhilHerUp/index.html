        <p class="card-text">The sun was setting majestically on the ocean, and the crowds on the beach had dispersed, but there were still quite a few sun–worshippers there. The beaches never emptied entirely on their island. Through her sunglasses, Rosemary looked up from her novel and admired the sunset. Another long, slow, beautiful day in paradise was coming to a close, and after nearly ten years she was finally beyond the too good to be true stage. It was true. She really lived here, and she really was a hero for the very reason she&#039;d been ostracized back home. She set the book down on her lap and pondered that thought once again.
Naturally, since she&#039;d stopped concentrating on the book, it wasn&#039;t long before Rosemary&#039;s attention…</p>

The remainder of that evening was, all at once, the quickest evening the Bird Women had yet spent in the Maxiversity and the slowest. After five months of misery with no hope for rescue, they finally had their first real chance; it&#039;s strange how much time seems to slow down as one comes to anticipate a wonderful event. As the Bird Women went through the nightly routine – being blindfolded in the locker room so that they couldn&#039;t see their fellow prisoners, having the blindfolds removed as they were herded into the bathroom stalls so that they could see the Swineherds watching them relieve themselves, having the blindfolds restored as they were sent to an edible but bland dinner…</p>

The following evening capped off a long day for Katie. Those two months had been so bleak and hopeless for the once–serene girl, now that she had found a ray of hope, she&#039;d found herself clinging so fiercely to it that she was beginning to get paranoid about things slipping away once again. It was two minutes to the start of Free Hour, and Katie had been pacing furiously back and forth across the floor of her hideout, praying that Penny would be there and that she&#039;d had better luck than Katie in tracking down recruits; Katie hadn&#039;t seen Lisa or Caryn at all that day.
Her fears subsided a bit when a tall, stocky girl with blonde curls appeared in the doorway. Initially terrified…</p>

Jae and Penny hurried uncomfortably through the Maxiversity hallway to the next exam session. One hellish semester, six humiliating months, behind them, and still no sign of the promised revolution. Even Lisa, the eternal optimist of the Bird Women, and Caryn, the most muscular and intimidating of the oppressed group, were losing their hope. Doing her best to ignore the intense summons emanating from between her long legs, Jae shuddered to think what she and her friends would do without Lisa and Caryn to give them hope.
&quot;D&#039;you think this bunch will be as rude as the boys from last week?&quot; Jae asked Penny between short breaths.
&quot;Hope not,&quot; the shorter girl answered. &quot;You&#039;d…</p>

The wait paid off, for when Katie rounded the corner towards the history library a few moments past 8:00, Penny was sitting at a table there, pretending to read an old Time magazine. &quot;Hi!&quot; Katie said cheerfully as she sat down. For once, the cheerfulness wasn&#039;t made up; Katie was delighted to have this slender reed of hope to cling to.
Penny was happy – for the first time since the Deluge – as well. &quot;Hey! I was just reading about Watergate here. It&#039;s amazing how far back the magazines go.&quot; As she closed the magazine, she couldn&#039;t help allowing a nervous glance at the Swineherd standing guard by the library door, not even fifteen feet away. They&#039;d found each other, but…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Melissa woke up late that Tuesday morning, just as she&#039;d been doing most mornings that summer. It was her last summer before college, too short to get a job and she wanted to relax as much as possible anyway. With her younger brother and sister away at camp and her two older siblings off traveling, there was usually no one in the house to wake her anyway.
No one except the ringing phone, anyway. Melissa rolled absentmindedly out of bed and stumbled across her room to answer it. &quot;Hello?&quot; she heard herself say groggily.
&quot;Hi, honey. You&#039;re not just getting out of bed, are you?&quot;
Melissa snapped wide–awake at her mother&#039;s voice. &quot;No, Mom,&quot; she lied. &quot;I just got back from jogging.&quot; She did her best not to chuckle…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Maggie checked her watch. Just past 5:30 and just outside her comfort zone. Six months into her job and life in New York, and she had the timing down perfectly. Two liters of water and no restroom breaks after 4:00, and let the rumbling on the subway do the rest. 
It was late October, and that morning had been pleasantly chilly on the walk from her apartment to the station and then to her office at the end of the line. The overcast sky and the ever so slight nip in the breeze had gotten her thinking; maybe this was one of her special days. When lunchtime had finally rolled around, she&#039;d known for sure. Friday night, a place of her own downtown, all that time to herself and the melancholy from the last breakup…</p>
