        <p class="card-text">As you might know, I usually try not to show desperation when I am in that state. I don&#039;t know why, but letting others know I have to pee badly is just something that never came easy to me. I can&#039;t even let Chris, my long–standing significant other; know when I&#039;m bursting. I try to act like nothing is wrong. There are times however, when desperation simply cannot be hidden. This story is about one of those times. Since this took place last weekend, the cat is out of the bag and Chris knows that holding a very full bladder, or better yet, watching him hold a very full bladder turns me on. He wasn&#039;t surprised!

        <p class="card-text">Dana had everything going for her. At twenty–five years old she had just landed a job paying $75,000 per year and she didn&#039;t even have a college education. I guess you could say she aced the interview by bluffing her way through it. Suddenly, Dana was the Vice President in a well known technology firm and had seven people working under her. Dana was good at doling out responsibilities, as she was the oldest of three sisters. Dana was also an Aries, so she was a born leader.
It was early September, the first day of Dana&#039;s new job. She was to spend the first week taking an intensive training course offered by the company for all new executives. Dana was confident. She dressed in a conservative blue suit, the…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Our long awaited spiritual retreat weekend was finally upon us. We packed the essentials and headed out toward the rustic cottage in the woods. This place is very familiar to us, as we do this twice a year. The beds are bunk style, but Chris and I remove the top mattress to make one larger bed on the bottom. We brought our own goose down comforters to place over the mattresses for comfort. We arrived Friday morning at 6 AM and began our day with a peaceful meditation, followed by a walk in nature. After swimming in the lake, we dressed for dinner. We went to a nearby bar and grille and had salads and lots of spring water. The sunny afternoon was quickly changing into a dark and cloud covered evening. The local…</p>

        <p class="card-text">For some reason, I have always been shy about telling anyone that I needed to use the bathroom. Most of the time, if there were no facilities around when my need arose, I just held it silently. This story is about one of those times, but after a few hours, I could no longer keep silent (or dry)!!!
Chris and I awoke early. It was a beautiful summer Saturday and we planned to get our errands done early, and then enjoy the day together doing absolutely nothing but enjoying nature. We went to the supermarket, the dry–cleaners, the pharmacy, and the garden shop. After all of this running around, we stopped at a diner for breakfast. When we finished our meal, Chris went up to the counter to pay the bill and I…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Hi, my name is MoonSpirit and I&#039;m a female. This story is about male desperation and how I found out that I get off on seeing my boyfriend desperate. I&#039;ve always had a thing for watching people who needed to use the bathroom, but never really realized there were others like me out there until I found your web site while surfing one day. Last month my boyfriend and I were driving into New York from New Jersey. We were meeting friends in the city at 7PM which put us at the Holland Tunnel in the height of rush hour traffic. Now, getting through the tunnel at this time in the evening usually takes about a half hour. Considering the fact that the drive from our home to the tunnel takes an hour, we were prepared for…</p>
