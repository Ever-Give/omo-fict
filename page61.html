        <p class="card-text">Alright, so this is pure fantasy. This is what I wanted to have happened when I was 18, because this teacher was just gorgeous
One day in 1987, when I was a young virile 18 year old, I had an experience that was to change my life and arouse my interest in water sports as my sexual preference. The last lesson at my Grammar School on Tuesday afternoons was Pottery, a subject I hated, but I was madly in love with the teacher, a beautiful middle aged Welsh lady called Mrs. Vale. I would dream about her. Fantasise about her. As always in these situations, I got the feeling through imagined body language that she fancied me and that it was only a matter of time. On that day thirteen years ago, my dream came true.…</p>

He was a math professor at the nearby college. A soft spoken, grey haired man who walked to the campus mornings looking at the flowers, the birds in the trees, and saying hello to a friendly, older woman who gardened and paused in her sweaty endeavors to say hello to the friendly old guy who wore tweed jackets with patched elbows, who incongruously chose to live upstairs in the four apartment building at the end of a disheveled street where the kudzu threatened to take over again and turn everything back to the swamp it had once been.

Though she’d never convince anyone else of it, it was often difficult being the most powerful woman in the world. Certainly, being a superheroine had its moments. You got to stomp on the occasional arch–criminal, you never aged so you always looked stunning, you were adored by millions of fans, especially undersexed boys, and you could always stride around confident in the knowledge that you could do things that no one else in the world could do. But there were drawbacks, things you couldn’t let the public know about or they might tarnish your heroic image. Keeping a secret identity was always the worst, because leading a double life can sap anyone’s strength, but…</p>

Jenny played on a championship U–25 field hockey team, and had traveled down from her home in Wilmington Delaware to Washington DC with two of her friends to play in a tournament. Steve had business in Washington that Saturday, so offered to come pick them up at the fields and drive them home.
Arriving just in time for the final game, Steve had watched Jenn and her friends win the championship game and had joined the team in a bar for a few celebratory beers afterwards. Steve had borrowed his sisters&#039; minivan for the trip, as he wasn&#039;t sure how many girls he…</p>

About nine months later, I received a letter from the man’s wife, Jill, as a result of this I rang her. We had both been deeply hurt. We had suffered a lot in common. This led to a number of calls. During one of them the subject of frustration came up. I was both surprised and excited when Jill said that she suffered most in bed at night, more and more she was having to resort to masturbation.

Before I left school, and aged 18, I took a Saturday morning job at a small filling station in Bristol. Normally there was a staff of three; the boss, who was a small, balding man nearing retirement who was always looking up my skirt, and his wife and son. Between them they served petrol and did some small repair jobs in the adjoining workshop but on Saturdays mornings only the boss turned up as the son took his mother shopping. This was OK for the first few weeks although if it was busy I sometimes found it difficult to find time to go to the loo, which was at the back of the workshop, and anyway I tried to avoid using it because it was filthy and the door…</p>
