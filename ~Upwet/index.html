        <p class="card-text">I was going away for a weekend up north with a girlfriend – we had been friends for years, and decided to &#039;catch up&#039; as we had not seen each other too much for a while. So we booked a room together, and went.
Now I should point out that though I like to look at other girls, I have never been with one before, so this weekend took me by suprise!
It started out in the car – it is a 6 hour drive north, and Kathy has a 4WD – so it could make it all in one go.
We had breakfast together, with the unlimited coffee that McDonalds offers to survive the boredom of the drive, and left.
Needless to say, the unlimited coffee doesn&#039;t just evaporate – about 2 hours into the trip it was redally time to go. I asked Kathy to…</p>

        <p class="card-text">I wanted to write about my experience today.
Firstly, I am a 23 year old lady, normal I suppose in most ways – except that I like the look of my body and I am a little kinky. I have always liked to be a showoff. I sometimes like to do things like show my panties in public or funny things like that. And ever since I was young, I have enjoyed wetting myself.
I haven&#039;t done this for a while, but over the past couple of days I have seen some wetting sites on the internet, and it excited me. So today, I decided I would pee in public for the first time.
I started off early, by drinking enough water at home that I nearly felt sick, and left straight for the train to the city. Once on there, I already needed to go…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Wow! I had such a great time with my last public wetting, I just had to do it again sometime – but I just couldn&#039;t find the time to plan something as elaborate as my first public pee – so I was suprised when the next one happened by accident...
I had a long day at work, and did some overtime until about 9PM – to survive I had drank no small amount of Coffee... Having had enough I decided to go out for a drink after work to relax.
I walked down to the local nightclub, and whilst walking, decided that maybe I should have went to the loo before I left. Not being too fond of public toilets anytime, let alone at night, I decided to hold until I got there...
When I did get inside, there were only two toilets –…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Hey there all of you again! I wanted to tell you about what happened to me a couple of nights ago, but first I want to know – are there really any other girls out there? I don&#039;t mind hearing from you guys either, but I was just wondering...
Anyway, as soon as I finished work the other day I decided to go for a quick look at some shops in town for Christmas presents – the Mall is just over 5 minutes from my work. I was was already kind of busting to go, but decided to see how long I could hold it for!
Well I went into town, and did a little shopping, ever needing to go more. But I realised something – if you don&#039;t drink any more, you don&#039;t need to go anymore! I realised this after walking around for close to…</p>
