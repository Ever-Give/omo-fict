        <p class="card-text">As many of you will know from my earlier stories, a small bladder such as mine, and coach outings are not a happy combination, and since my early teaching days I have always been wary of school outings in coaches, which seem to have become an end of term tradition, despite all the changes in the education system. As a young teacher, my first school outing became a nightmare of absolute desperation, ending with wet knickers, that, luckily, I managed to keep hidden. My school is no different, and though we try to make some of the outings &#039;educational,&#039; others are purely for fun, and it was one of these fun outings that I volunteered to organise, not because I wanted the extra responsibility, or credit by giving…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Anyone living in the Greater London or home counties are will know the M25 orbital motorway and its well deserved reputation for traffic hold–ups. 
Not all of you will also know that the complete ring around London, over 120 miles (200 Km.) has only 2 service areas, so, as you might imagine, I do not travel on that road unless there is no alternative. 
Unfortunately there often is &#039;no alternative&#039; if you want to get to somewhere the other side of London, as I sometimes do when visiting my &#039;best friend&#039; from my schooldays, Mary, who has married and moved to the other side of London. The alternatives to driving round the M25 to visit her are either public transport which means going into the centre of London…</p>

        <p class="card-text">It has occurred to me that there is some point in the process of growing–up when a person is somehow expected to have developed an &#039;adult&#039; bladder with almost infinite control. That mysterious age when we were suddenly considered to be &#039;big girls&#039; and that somehow we had been gifted with bladder control and capacity that many adults (including me!) could only envy. When I was taken to the Doctor with my &#039;bladder problem,&#039; I had been told it would &#039;get better as I grew up&#039; so I always looked forward to the time when I was &#039;grown up&#039; and by some mysterious way would no longer suffer from sudden, frequent, and urgent needs for a loo. Before this time came I was, without being consulted, considered old enough to…</p>
