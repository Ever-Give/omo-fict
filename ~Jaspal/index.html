        <p class="card-text">Maggie sipped eagerly from her 1L water bottle as she looked over her notes one last time. She had already gulped down a large mug of coffee and a tall glass of orange juice immediately after her morning pee. She was on her way to write her last exam before a two week break between semesters. Sherry and Sabrina had been over the night before studying while engaging in some wet fun.

She had managed to separate herself from Sherry and Sabrina, using the excuse of wanting to enjoy the sunshine for a bit while they waited in line. It was hard hiding her secret game from them when the desperation got this bad. That said, Maggie found these adventures to be much too exciting to resist.
