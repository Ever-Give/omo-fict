        <p class="card-text">Nina glanced at her boyfriend Sam and giggled nervously as she squirmed around in her seat a little. She&#039;s had a full mega size soft drink and was starting to feel the effects of it in her bladder. Checking her watch she realised that she was only halfway through the movie and still had almost another hour to go, and it was a premiere she was NOT missing even a minute of because of for a bathroom break.
A bit further into the movie she was having trouble concentrating and sitting still and Sam noticed and asked what was wrong.
&quot;Oh nothing. I just have to pee really badly thats all. It&#039;s so bad I&#039;m thinking about going.&quot;
&quot;Oh god just hold it. The cinema is packed and you&#039;ll have to step on about 40 people…</p>

Now I should point out that though I like to look at other girls, I have never been with one before, so this weekend took me by suprise!
It started out in the car – it is a 6 hour drive north, and Kathy has a 4WD – so it could make it all in one go.
We had breakfast together, with the unlimited coffee that McDonalds offers to survive the boredom of the drive, and left.
Needless to say, the unlimited coffee doesn&#039;t just evaporate – about 2 hours into the trip it was redally time to go. I asked Kathy to…</p>

        <p class="card-text">A number of decades ago back in Hungary, I lived in a basement room in the old district of the capitol city, Budapest. In my room, I had one of those low, street–level windows that are somewhat recessed into the outside wall, are always covered with grime and are hardly noticeable from the outside. I used to sit there peering outside at the legs of passers–by. In those days city woman still wore skirts. French panties, stockings and suspenders underneath was the norm. 
If I plastered my face against the window pain, and strained my neck, and a passer–by was obligingly near to my window, I could see up her skirt, see her white thighs over the stocking tops and sometime I could even catch a glimpse of her…</p>

He had been looking for a job over summer, to get some cash ready for his second year at college, and the opportunity came in the form of the Daley family. The Daleys were from England and had been friends of Robert’s parents since they moved in about five years ago, and so Robert was very familiar with their daughter Susanne. Susanne was fourteen, almost fifteen, and was growing up to be a very attractive young woman. I was introduced to her myself at around the same time, and she was quite striking in that…</p>

We graduated high school like most girls I know with stretchy bladders as our school washrooms were totally gross! Cathy has the strongest bladder of any girl I know. She is the only person I know who can get up in the morning and go to a full morning&#039;s classes without going pee. She just gets up brushes her teeth, showers has breakfast with at least two cups of tea ,that would right there have my legs crossed! Then she goes to class and has another drink at mid morning.

As you will know from reading my last story &quot;Christmas Shopping&quot;, my friend Cathy and I like to hold it. Not only do we like to hold our bladders which I am good at and Cathy is a professional at doing but, we like to get other unsuspecting girls to have to hold it too!! I believe holding is just a matter of knowing above all that your bladder can expand to accommodate the amount of piss that you need to put in it! Accidents are likewise a lack of confidence and the panic causes the loss of control more than lack of muscle tone. How many girls can hold it till they are just getting their panties down or just about there?? I know that they could manage those crucial seconds and get away…</p>

A third true story taken from tape recordings with my girlfriend Nathalie:
By the time I was 20 I was working as an estate agent with my Dad, that meant that he was doing most of the paperwork to start with while I showed people around houses. On my third day at work I had been out all morning with a family of four and we had visited half a dozen houses by 1.30pm, which was well into my lunchtime. They were staying in a hotel in the town and I dropped them off there before driving back to the office on the other side of town. I remember the trip well as by then I was really looking forward to having a pee. I hadn&#039;t been since before breakfast and had been given coffee by four of the vendors as…</p>

Firstly, I am a 23 year old lady, normal I suppose in most ways – except that I like the look of my body and I am a little kinky. I have always liked to be a showoff. I sometimes like to do things like show my panties in public or funny things like that. And ever since I was young, I have enjoyed wetting myself.
I haven&#039;t done this for a while, but over the past couple of days I have seen some wetting sites on the internet, and it excited me. So today, I decided I would pee in public for the first time.
I started off early, by drinking enough water at home that I nearly felt sick, and left straight for the train to the city. Once on there, I already needed to go…</p>

I had a long day at work, and did some overtime until about 9PM – to survive I had drank no small amount of Coffee... Having had enough I decided to go out for a drink after work to relax.
I walked down to the local nightclub, and whilst walking, decided that maybe I should have went to the loo before I left. Not being too fond of public toilets anytime, let alone at night, I decided to hold until I got there...
