        <p class="card-text">One morning I had tons of laundry to do, having put it off for a week or more. My roommate Jess and I are in college, and we live on the second floor of our apartment complex. The laundry room is in the basement, shared by all the tenants in that section of the complex. The laundry room is also the storage room, with each apartment&#039;s storage cubbies around the edge of the basement.
I made sure to get up early so I could be the first one to get my laundry in. Usually Saturdays were the busiest time for laundry so I avoided that day. This was a Friday morning and hopefully there would be no one getting their laundry in before me since I had so much to do.

        <p class="card-text">I have to admit there have been times that I have enjoyed the feeling of desperation or wondered what it was like to have an accident at this age, but I wasn&#039;t prepared for what happened to me one day out in public.
Since I was starting college in a few weeks, my stepmom agreed to come with me for some nice back to school clothes. Usually when I know I am going to try on lots of clothes, I wear things that are easy to get on and off repeatedly.
