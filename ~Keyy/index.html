        <p class="card-text">There was the usual drinking and pot smoking and since we were out in the middle of nowhere, there were no places to &quot;go&quot; for the ladies. Anyway, this one girl was consuming a copious amount of alcohol and we all know what that does to people. It lowers your inhibitions and makes you have to pee every 10 minutes.
Meg, the girl in question was always a bit of an exhibitionist and quite open about her body. We were all gathered around the fire and she kept saying &quot;man I really have to pee.&quot; After about the 4th time she said this she said &quot;Fuck it, I am just gonna go right here&quot; so she stepped back about 3 feet from the fire, turned her back towards us and let rip one of the most powerful streams I have ever…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Hey, all! I go to Texas A&amp;M and last night was our first viewing session in Film Studies. We were watching Gone With the Wind, which is about 4hrs long. Anyway, the professor asked that none of us leave our seats and disturb the class. About 3 hrs into it I noticed that two girls in front of me had started whispering to each other. One told the other that she &quot;had to pee so bad&quot;. Finally something interesting!! From that point on I could not tell you how the movie went, as I was too busy watching this girl. There was a large amount of weight shifting and leg twisting going on. With about 15 minutes left in the movie, I noticed that this girl started whimpering very quietly and I could see tears glinting on her…</p>
