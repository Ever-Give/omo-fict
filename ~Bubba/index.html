        <p class="card-text">Glancing at the elegant gold watch her parents had given her as a commencement gift (a newer car, she felt, would have been much more appreciated), Sandy was surprised to see that another hour had past. Looking up out the far window of the 17th floor, she was also not expecting night to have overtaken the day so quickly. Daylight savings time had been implemented only the previous weekend, and she, like most everyone else, was still adjusting. Honestly, the night did not appear much different from the just–ended day, which had been overrun with ominous clouds, destroying any chance of sunlight heating their quaint city beyond the freezing point. On a clear day, it was possible to see as far as 35 miles from…</p>

        <p class="card-text">A week later, with only two weekends remaining before heading back to their respective schools, Sandy informed Robert that she was ready to take their relationship to the next level and spend the night with him. Both Sandy and Robert were extremely nervous yet excited about the idea, as they had both been saving themselves for the right person, and it seemed that their waiting would finally pay off. Robert spared no expense in planning the perfect evening. A quite impressive cook for a college student, he prepared a candlelight dinner of salmon and steamed vegetables, followed by white chocolate mousse for dessert, both served with plenty of punch. Neither Sandy nor Robert was keen on alcohol, Robert because…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Sandy&#039;s much increased bladder capacity allowed her to earn a remarkable 1430 points out of a possible 1600 on her SATs, permitting her admittance to a top–ranked ivy–league school. Her parents couldn&#039;t be prouder, and frankly, Sandy couldn&#039;t have been more pleased with herself for conquering her illness. Throughout the remainder of high school and the first two years of college, Sandy rarely missed any class on account of her bladder. There were still some days when her thirst would be too great and she would still need to leave occasionally, but those days were few and far between. She continued working on her kegel exercises, and only visited the toilet when absolutely necessary. Even when bursting, she…</p>

        <p class="card-text">&quot;Sandy, would you like some coffee?&quot;
Sandy looked up from her cluttered desk and politely declined. &quot;Thank you Doreen, but I had better not.&quot; Truth be told, Sandy, along with the rest of the crew working on Senator Hazelwood&#039;s re–election campaign, could definitely use a caffeine jolt as the day continued past 5:00 into the young hours of the evening. With only a week remaining until the election and early polls showing a near dead–heat between the senator and his vivacious challenger, everyone at Hazelwood&#039;s camp was putting in heavy overtime. &quot;Are you sure?&quot; Doreen persisted. &quot;You look like you could really use one.&quot; Sandy sighed. &quot;Yeah, I probably could, but I don&#039;t like to drink caffeine later in the day.…</p>
