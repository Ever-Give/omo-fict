We exchanged a few words and she asked if I had been there before.
I said I had, so she asked if I knew if there was a toilet near by, as she badly needed to take a leak. I said I had used a men&#039;s room last time, which was in the basement down steps outside around the back, so I guessed that there would be a ladies&#039;…</p>
