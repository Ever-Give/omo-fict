She sucked the wound ruefully; although she hadn&#039;t drawn blood, she expected that there would be a blood blister there later. God, what a day it had been; what a week, in fact. It had been all about stress, pressure, with a liberal helping of frustration thrown in for good measure; she was glad it was finally over, for the weekend, at least. But who knew what…</p>

God, it was hot! In fact, it was one of the hottest days I can ever remember, at least in the UK. It was so hot, you didn&#039;t want to do anything; even breathing was an effort. My friend Claire and I were sprawled on a park bench, shaded from the direct sunlight by a large tree. Neither of us had any energy at all – we&#039;d just used up what little we had drinking cold lagers in a nearby pub! 
&#039;Oh, Christ, Jen! This heat really is just too much,&#039; Claire wailed, &#039;I&#039;m absolutely busting for a piss, but I can&#039;t be bothered to move!&#039;

&#039;Coming!&#039; 
Rebecca grinned to herself as her daughter crashed down the stairs. Although in age technically and legally an adult she may be, but Lucy could still be a noisy adolescent when she wanted to. 
&#039;Okay, then. I&#039;m ready.&#039; Lucy put her arms round her mother&#039;s neck and gave her a hug. &#039;Thanks, Mum– I&#039;ve been looking forward to today for ages and ages.&#039;
Today they were going on a shopping trip to London. It was a belated treat for Lucy&#039;s 18th birthday – belated by…</p>
