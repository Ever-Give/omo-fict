        <p class="card-text">This story contains male desperation. We only publish it because it&#039;s part of the PP Watcher &quot;Dilemma&quot; stories.
I suppose we all discovered desperation and peeing as being sexual at different times in our lives. For me it came late in life although at a young age I do have some memories of peeing and desperation. As a child of about 6 I can remember the girl across the street was my first experience with desperation and peeing. At that time it was simply curiosity and in no way was it sexually arousing to me. I was an only child, and had parents that didn&#039;t talk much about the differences between boys and girls. Susan and I had both loved to play in the big wooded area behind my house. We were the last house…</p>

        <p class="card-text">What is the reason for mankind&#039;s obsession with control? Everyone has the message imprinted on their mind: control your life, control the lives of others, and control the world around you. Dangerous as it may be, it is a desire which we all share, it&#039;s in the DNA, it&#039;s instinct. For centuries man has controlled woman, and only recently has she fought back, but she didn&#039;t want equality, she wanted to have that control for herself. Nobody is exempt from this rule.That was how I justified what I was doing this afternoon. When a woman seems to be in trouble it should be natural to want to help her, now shouldn&#039;t it?

        <p class="card-text">(A completely true incident that occurred in December 2000)
The heat was rising in waves off the concrete apron of Adelaide’s’ airport as we boarded the turboprop driven Lockheed Metro for the flight to Coober Pede – the famous opal mining town in the Australian desert, a couple of hundred kilometers south of Alice Springs. Twenty–five assorted travelers climbed the two or three steps into the hot little cabin of the commuter plane and took their places in one of the two rows of twelve single seats that ran on either side of the narrow aisle. The twenty–fifth seat was placed in the aisle against the rear bulkhead, making the last row into a threesome. In the first pair of seats behind the curtained off flight…</p>

We had only been travelling for 5 or 6 minutes when I saw Jennifer fidgeting in her seat and the look I know all too well came across her face. &quot;I&#039;m not going to make it home, can you pull over?&quot; We had just reached a small village so she was hardly going to pee in front of someone’s house. &quot;Just as soon as we get out of…</p>

One cold winter morning while it was raining a bit as well, I pulled my van from the garage and felt that I had to pee. But I didn&#039;t want to go back in and pull up my skirt, pull down my hose and panties, so I just went on to work. 15 miles from the office there was a wreck on the highway. Not too bad but it held up traffic for about 20 minutes. I had to pee ever so badly and no where to pull off the road to relieve myself. Finally traffic was moving again and it started to rain rather hard. Ten miles from the office, I felt a burst of hot pee gush through my panties.…</p>

I walked into town, as there were several things that I needed to do – go to the post office, take a prescription in, etc… By the time I got into town I was bursting to pee, but I ignored it and carried on with walking about the town.

I traveled to a small village in Basildon. The purpose of this visit was to film someone as they left a building on my camcorder. Fortunately for me, the building in question was about 50 yards from a railway station, so I knew I could sit and wait at the station without looking suspicious. I arrived at the village around lunchtime, which gave me a couple of hours to kill. I was wearing black jeans, a red sweater and new trainers, and as this is England, I had my coat on, too. I wasn’t prepared for the fact this was only a tiny village and not much was in it. I decided to take a walk around and see some of the next village when I…</p>
