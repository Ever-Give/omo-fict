        <p class="card-text">It was a Friday– the 23rd of June, to be precise. It was a date that Jennifer would never forget. It was on that date, when aged only 19, that one of those life–changing events occurred that you never forget.
It had started out like any other ordinary day. She was sat in a classroom in college and the afternoon was dragging. It wasn&#039;t the lesson, that was interesting enough, but she had plans for that night and was eager to get home. It was strange how time always seemed to slow down on those occasions when you actually want it to speed up! Jennifer was, by anyone&#039;s view, a &#039;stunner&#039;; shoulder length brunette hair that never looked wrong however she wore it, cute pert 34b breasts and legs that went all the…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Let me first explain why I&#039;m writing these stories. I&#039;ve got kind of a dilemma. I really enjoy desperation stories, but whenever I encounter such situations in real life, I&#039;m far too much of a nice guy to try and prolong a girl&#039;s need. In fact, on the most notable occasions, I&#039;ve felt extremely bad for them, and even worse at the simple idea that I&#039;d enjoy such a situation.
So I&#039;ve concocted Parker. Parker isn&#039;t really me; most of the stories I&#039;m telling here are entirely fictional. But Parker&#039;s got my approach: when a girl needs to pee around him, he tries to help her as much as he can. He doesn&#039;t get off on it until later (and I don&#039;t do that, not if the girl in question is a friend of mine; it would be way…</p>

It&#039;s past noon and she hasn&#039;t moved from her desk since she arrived that morning. And worse, all the coffee she drunk all morning has since descended to her bladder.
In another situation she wouldn&#039;t have gave it a second thought and would have walked the thirty steps that separated her office from the toilets (two of them, shared with the rest of the offices on the floor), but that time she couldn&#039;t do it because her sister (the only one that worked with her in the family business) had gone out to do some errands.

At her school any request to leave the classroom was to be refused so Barbara was left to squirm and fidget throughout the class in the hope she could hold her water until the end of the class. Squirm and fidget she did telegraphing to all her nearby classmates the cause of her distress. Barbara had to pee very badly and her friends knew it.
Barbara was wearing a light blue, denim knee–length straight skirt. I mention all this because Barbara was completely unable to hold herself due to the tightness of her skirt. When Barbara got…</p>

About a week after the break–up she called and insisted that we have &quot;girl&#039;s night.&quot; I did not need one, but it seemed fun anyway.

Hitchhiking across the country had sounded like fun at the time. Darren had talked Kelly into it right away, and between the two of them they&#039;d managed to win Jill around as well. It would be good for her, they said. She needed to break out of her shell, and a big adventure could help. Darren had done it before, going the other way, and he hadn&#039;t had any trouble; the fact that he was a 6&#039;1&quot; kick boxer was a huge help, of course. So it was just daring and exciting enough to help Jill grow as a person, while not actually taking any risks.
Jill had enjoyed it too, especially when they were just out of Chicago, but every now and then she&#039;d gone quiet and appeared to be…</p>

As a powerful, apparently never–ending torrent gushed out from between her legs; she began to do some mental arithmetic. Since she had been living with Simon, she had abandoned her habit of taking a leak before going to bed.

In the weeks following her first frantic evening with Simon (see Sarah Stops Being Sensible – Part 1) they had had four more dates. On three of them (a girl can&#039;t be too predictable) she had got extremely desperate for the toilet and Simon had had to shepherd her to a ladies&#039; lavatory. The relationship had gone swimmingly (so to speak) and after a couple of months they had decided to move in together. They had found quite a nice little flat right on the outskirts of North London (housing in London was a real problem), of which the only disadvantage was a long journey home.

This first story of mine, however, is not part of the series and is based on a true story.

        <p class="card-text">&#039;How did it go so wrong,&#039; Gabri–Ann asked herself as she sat in her jail cell on this miserable, half–frozen planet. Since her empathic abilities had developed she sensed she was destined to meet her soul mate, the women she would join with for life, but it never happened. Then she started working for the Paltathion Ministry of Education, only to be arrested for murder. And then she had believed she could postpone her execution indefinitely by giving herself to Cota, but now even that had failed.
Gabri–Ann sensed the jailers were coming with a new prisoner, and she combed her short blond hair and straightened her robe before they entered. The new prisoner was wearing an officer&#039;s uniform of the Imperial…</p>

        <p class="card-text">There was a new Mexican place that my friend insisted I just had to try. I had my doubts since she&#039;s never been into spicy food. Then it dawned on me. Tammy broke her ankle a few days back and she probably had a bad case of cabin fever. There was no way I could turn her down, even in the middle of a busy Sunday.
I have to admit Tammy looks very cute on crutches. She&#039;s petite and wears these pleated mini skirts that give her the prep school girl look even though we&#039;re older than that. Everyone was very courteous at the restaurant, holding the door open for her and giving her sympathetic smiles.
I&#039;m technically hotter, but she looks younger and more endearing. I was glad I wore my tank top and really short…</p>

When the Authority created my position, it was in advance of suitable offices being built at a number of locations throughout the county. The situation on my patch was no different, and for the first year in the job, I had to work out of a large portacabin.
The portacabin was not as grim as it might sound. It was well appointed, with reasonable office furniture, plenty of heat, microwave and kettle, and so on. The only questionable thing about this mobile office was that the powers that be…</p>

It all started when a friend and I had to fly from Scotland to London for work. We were running late leaving the office to catch the plane. I had said to Lucy that I was bursting for the loo, and she said that she needed to go too, but she said the taxi was waiting and there was no time because we were running late so we had to leave now!
