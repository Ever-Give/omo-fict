        <p class="card-text">This is an incident that happened a long time ago when my husband (Bill) and I were just starting to date. It was a warm day in June and Bill picked me up for a long drive in the country. We were driving aimlessly around near Hartford, CT trying to decide where to go when Bill said: &quot;Let&#039;s drive up to Massachusetts and visit my sister.&quot; Nothing unusual happened on the long 2–hour ride to MA. We stopped and picked up some beer and a bottle of wine and arrived late in the afternoon.
When we arrived, I needed to pee but not very bad; I just had to squeeze my pee hole muscles a little tighter to keep from dribbling in my panties. Bill&#039;s sister lived alone in a 1–bedroom bungalow on the outskirts of town. She was…</p>

        <p class="card-text">One day my husband (Don) and I were moving some furniture into a storage shed. When I had to pee, I realized that there were no toilets nearby. At first I crossed my legs when I had a chance and squeezed my pussy muscles real tight to keep from peeing in my panties. Crossing my legs helps me hold my pee if I don&#039;t have to go too bad but when I am desperate to pee I have to put pressure on my pussy. Sometimes I put my hand inside my panties and press on my peehole. Since no one was around, I was able to put my hand under my dress and hold my pussy from time to time. Before long I was crossing my legs, rubbing my pussy, pressing on my peehole and doing a nice little pee pee dance. I was wearing white cotton…</p>

        <p class="card-text">I&#039;m a woman who gets very aroused by the sight of another girl or woman who is desperate to pee. Maybe that&#039;s because I love to pee and I love to hold my pee. I work in an office and I often hold off going to pee as long as I can. This has caused me to squirt pee into my panties on several occasions.
I nearly always wear dresses or skirts to work and no one can see me when I&#039;m behind my desk. I sometimes sit at my desk put my hand under my skirt and play with my pussy thru my panties. It feels so good to press my hand up against my pussy when I have to pee and the more I have to pee the better it feels. 
I also play other solo pee games at work but I&#039;ll save them for later because I want to talk about…</p>
