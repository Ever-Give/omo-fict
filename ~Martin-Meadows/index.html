I was a desperately horny 18– year– old virgin guy, a Private in the Military, posted at an out of the way air base. The ratio of men to women on the base was about 15 to 1. There was a small town nearby, but to attract a girl there one had to surpass both competition from the military men and all the local competition. Us &#039;Pigeons&#039; as the local town boys called us– were highly resented for hitting on the local girls. I&#039;m not saying it was impossible to date a woman, but although I wasn&#039;t ugly, I did have an acne problem at that age. This certainly didn&#039;t help when the competition was so fierce, and I was also shy knowing that I wasn&#039;t as attractive as some of the…</p>

        <p class="card-text">A male / female wet sex fantasy
I am on an express bus sitting in a rear seat, going out to the suburbs to visit a relative for the weekend. The bus stops at one of the last downtown pickup points and then becomes an express bus with no more stops.
A beautiful, petite, slim, very sexy young woman climbs aboard. Her spectacular green eyes, set in a finely chiseled, sharp but not harshly contoured aquiline face, contrast marvelously with her stunning red hair. She is wearing a not quite see through green blouse that sets off her eyes and hints at a sexy, lacy bra cradling petite but perky eagerly up–thrusting breasts.
