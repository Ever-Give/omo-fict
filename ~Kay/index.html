        <p class="card-text">Here is another true story from me. This time it wasn&#039;t me doing the peeing, though– I was just an invisible watcher!
I work in an office where we are all basically in low walled cubicles, and can see each other – except some managers who have offices – most people would know the type – glass windows but the top half is frosted.
Well, I don&#039;t think anyone notices, but from my desk I look right into the lower half of one of the females offices, right at her legs through her desk. And if she spins sideways to look at her return (one of those L shaped desks), I can see right up her crotch.
Anyway, I was working late shift (again!) and she was in there too. I started to hear her groaning, and could see her…</p>

        <p class="card-text">I have been a &#039;wetter&#039; since i was about 12 – I am 26 now and still wet myself more than once a week! I used to think I was strange, but when I got the internet a couple of months ago i realized that there were plenty of girls like me, and plenty of guys who like it...
Also, since I found your site I have been a little bolder about where I wet myself – I used to do most of it at home, like in the back or front yard – there were times I did it &#039;publicly&#039;, but I have been doing it a whole lot more in the past month! I have always been a bit of a showoff – I like to wear short skirts and sometimes even flash my panties or butt at guys, but now I like to pee outside too.
So I though you might like to know about…</p>
