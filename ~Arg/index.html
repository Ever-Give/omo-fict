        <p class="card-text">Tuesday afternoon. For a change, wetting was not on Joan&#039;s mind this afternoon. No, self–indulgence could wait; today&#039;s mission was Health and Fitness. A quick phone call to the Gym had renewed her lapsed membership and now she had called in at the mall to pick up some new workout clothes.
Joan&#039;s taste didn&#039;t run to anything flashy – just an oversize tee shirt and a pair of shorts, but a good sports bra was essential. The sports store had a good selection. Joan was admiring some bras in a pleasing shade of blue Lycra when an enthusiastic sales assistant came bouncing up to her.
&quot;That&#039;s our best–selling line. I even wear them myself.&quot;
&quot;Oh yes? What&#039;s so good about them then?&quot;
&quot;It&#039;s these new…</p>

        <p class="card-text">This story is based on the characters in JJ&#039;s &quot;Lynn&quot; series. Apart from that, it is total fiction.
Cast of characters:
Lynn Mandy– Lynn&#039;s sister Jo–Anne– Lynn&#039;s friend Amy– Lynn &amp; Jo–Anne&#039;s friend Donna– Amy&#039;s neighbor/sister Sue– Lynn&#039;s mother Joan– Donna&#039;s mother
For a couple of weeks after Donna had introduced her to the pleasures of wetting, Joan couldn&#039;t stop thinking about it. She couldn&#039;t dare risk the embarrassment of doing it in public again, but compromised on what she thought of as her &#039;piddle &amp; diddle sessions.&#039; The garden was nice and secluded, so she could fill up by drinking plenty of water during the morning, then find a quiet time in the afternoon when no one else was home to slip into the…</p>
