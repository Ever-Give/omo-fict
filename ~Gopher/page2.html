I was shopping at the local supermarket and was packing the goods as they came through the checkout. It was quite a busy time and there was a long queue at each till. When the last items came through, I packed them up and turned to pay the cashier. As I handed over the money I heard someone say &quot;Noooo&quot; in a shrill anguished voice. I looked, and the next lady in line had her hands firmly jammed in her crotch and was doing a frantic pee–pee dance. As I collected my change she seemed to get herself under control. I turned to her and said that I sympathized with her predicament and asked her whether I could help…</p>

        <p class="card-text">A couple of days after the beach showers happening, I was in my study when the phone rang. &quot;Hello&quot; I said and a voice the other end replied in soft seductive tones &quot;Hi big daddy. How are you today then?&quot; It was Josie. &quot;Charlene and I were wondering how you enjoyed our little adventure on the beach the other day?&quot; she continued.
&quot;Well, erm, just fine,&quot; I said, a little shocked from her forwardness. &quot;No! More than that,&quot; I continued, &quot;I found it absolutely marvelous. Thank you.&quot;
Josie went on to tell me that their mum &amp; dad had gone away for the weekend and that they had the place all to themselves. &quot;We wondered whether you would like to come over and play rude with us,&quot; she asked.
&quot;Yeah, please do if you…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Author&#039;s They were identical twins– friends of my daughter, blonde, busty, and beautiful too. They were always teasers and knew how to do it, and how far it was safe to go as well. At least I used to think so. On the day that it happened, we were taking a trip to the beach. No, not the main public beach where everyone went, but a small slightly secluded beach, which was usually quiet because there were no shops ice cream vans or candy stalls around. When we arrived, Helena (my daughter) and I had our beach/swim wear on under our clothes so we went straight to the beach but Josie and Charlene, the twins, went to the ladies&#039; to change first.
Helena is an excellent swimmer and she loves swimming, so she went…</p>
