        <p class="card-text">Elizabeth was on her way home from the office. She was bursting for a wee so she called in at her friend Julia&#039;s place to use her bathroom. She parked the car, got out and struggled to Julia&#039;s front door.
&quot;Hi Jules, can I please use your bathroom? I&#039;m absolutely bursting for a wee.&quot; She asked when Julia came to the door.
&quot;Sure, you know where it is,&quot; said Julia, standing aside to let her past. Elizabeth took the stairs 2 at a time, holding her crotch as she went. Julia followed her up. Elizabeth darted into the bathroom leaving the door wide open. She hiked up her skirt and yanked down her panties just in time. Before she could properly lower herself onto the toilet seat a gusher of steamy hot golden pee…</p>

I work for a large manufacturing company in the UK, and management had decided that we were to have a three–day team training exercise. We were to spend the three team training days at a large hotel in the country, all expenses paid, and most of us were quite excited at the idea. After all, the company was paying and it was a break from the normal daily routine.
Well, the day came and we all boarded the luxurious coaches that had been laid on and after a journey of about an hour and a half, we arrived at the hotel.…</p>

When I was in my late teens, my local park had a boating lake, and Bill, the boatman used to let some of us help him and in return we would get free trips out on the rowing boats. There were several of us– including girl called Tracey, who was about 3 years younger than I. I found her quite attractive and often took the opportunity to share a rowing boat with her. 
One day we rowed into the centre of the lake and drew in the oars, allowing the boat to just drift. We chatted for a while, and soon found ourselves looking into each other&#039;s eyes. We kissed, gently at first but soon quite passionately. Tracey&#039;s hand strayed to my leg, just above…</p>

Marge and George were decorating their bedroom. The old wallpaper had been stripped off, the paintwork rubbed down, and they had been to purchase the new paint and paper. When they returned, and pulled onto the driveway, Marge went to unlock the front door while George got the goods out of the car. As he stood up he was surprised to see a young lady in obvious great discomfort approaching him. She only took small steps and yet was hurrying, clutching her abdomen.
&quot;Excuse me,&quot; she said to…</p>

Alan lived opposite a park with a clear view of the bus stop that was outside the entrance. He often used to sit and watch people coming and going through the park, and people waiting for the bus. 
Late one evening he was looking out of his window and he saw a couple of young ladies coming out of the park. They looked to be in their late teens or early twenties, and Alan thought they looked quite attractive. One was brown skinned with black hair, and the other was white skinned with ginger hair. Both were…</p>

Julia and Jessica had been friends since childhood. They had grown up together and were now 20 years old. They had always talked openly together about almost everything, including sexual urges and behaviour. Occasionally they indulged in wetting themselves together, for they both enjoyed feeling their bladders filling up to their capacity and sometimes they went that one bit too far. One Saturday the two were shopping in town. They had drunk several large cokes during the morning and were seated in the…</p>

Pauline and I had been friends since early childhood. We&#039;d grown up together, played together, gone to school together, and done lots of things together. We knew each other pretty well, or so I thought. We both loved cycling and often went for long bike rides in the country, and it was on a summer&#039;s day that we were out cycling together, and had stopped for a drink and a break. Pauline also likes painting. Scenes, portraits, that sort of thing and she&#039;s really good at it. She asked me if I would pose for her, as she wanted to paint me. I&#039;d done so before so I said, &quot;sure, of course I will.&quot;

Margaret, Maisie and Mandy were sisters. Margaret was the oldest aged 22, Maisie was 20, and Mandy was 19.
About 5 years ago, while she was in school, Maisie had taken part in a French Exchange visit, where she went to stay with a family near Lyons for two weeks, and then the daughter of the French family, Juliette, came to stay with them for two weeks. They had kept in touch, and Juliette, who was the same age as Maisie, was spending a fortnight&#039;s break with Maisie and her sisters. Of course, there…</p>

Natalie had long dark auburn hair and was a slightly plump but pretty girl in her late teens who had a crush on me, despite the fact that I am about 20 years or so her senior. I often visited her parents at their home and Natalie would almost always sit next to me on the sofa. On a couple of occasions she had shown me something of her body, and strangely her parents hadn&#039;t objected. The first occasion was when her mum came in with some new clothes for her. She immediately took them out of the bags and held up a blouse and a bra. Without further ado she stood up, facing me, and removed her top and bra, her ample 38DD breasts bouncing…</p>

After discovering they were playing &#039;how long can we hold it&#039; we had a very enjoyable evening, and I agreed to stay the night and start the day off with them on equal footings.
We got up the next morning, peed and showered together. We had great fun with squeals of delight as we soaped and lathered each other. I paid particular attention to making sure that both Jilly&#039;s and Jenny&#039;s firm breasts were spotlessly clean and also that every millimetre of their pussies was…</p>

        <p class="card-text">It had been ages since I had visited my aunt in the Midlands and since I was in the area on a business trip I decided to drop in. Aunt May was always happy to put up anyone who dropped in, whether they were expected or not, so I decided to surprise her and turn up unannounced. I arrived about 7pm on Friday evening, knocked the door, walked in and shouted &quot;Hi!&quot;
I was a little surprised when a young female voice shouted back, &quot;Who&#039;s that?&quot; I walked into the lounge and saw that Jenny and Jilly were sitting on the sofa with no sign of Aunt May. Jenny and Jilly were identical twins that lived across the road from Aunt May. They were about 23 years old and were absolutely gorgeous. &quot;Oh, Hi Gord,&quot; said Jilly, &quot;Your…</p>

        <p class="card-text">I was driving home from the office. I was alone in the car, and suddenly the traffic slowed and came to an abrupt halt. For the next half hour we started, crawled, and stopped, covering about half a mile. Up ahead there was a bus stop and about twenty folk waiting. I glanced in the mirrors and could see no bus behind me. I felt sorry for them because I guessed they&#039;d got a fair wait ahead of them. As I looked at them I noticed one, a dark haired lady in her twenties jogging up and down. Suddenly her hand went between her legs and she bent forwards at the waist, bending her knees. Slowly she straightened up and seemed to regain control, but then she went into a pee dance, hopping rapidly from one foot to the…</p>

        <p class="card-text">It was the night of the party. Harry looked at the invitation closely. 7:30pm at Mandy&#039;s house. He glanced at his watch. It was 6:30. &quot;Half an hour&#039;s walk to Mandy&#039;s,&quot; he thought, &quot;Just time for a shave, shower, and spruce up&quot; so he stripped off, shaved and showered, dried off and dressed. He glanced at his watch again. 7pm. Perfect. He put on his coat and set off for Mandy&#039;s house.
He arrived at Mandy&#039;s dead on 7:30 but he was surprised to see no cars in the driveway. He re–checked the invite. Yeah, it was definitely the right day and time, so he rang the doorbell. After a few moments Mandy appeared at the door but she sure wasn&#039;t dressed for a party. She had on an old white tee shirt and a pair of pink…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Jane lived up to her name. She&#039;d always been a plain girl and somewhat unattractive, I thought. She&#039;d been a classmate of my daughter when she was in school but after they left they sort of lost touch with each other. That was nearly ten years ago.
A couple of weeks ago, who turns up on my doorstep but Jane? She still looked quite plain. Not the sort of girl that would cause me to turn my head. Anyhow, out of politeness I asked her in and offered her a cup of tea, which she gratefully accepted. I couldn&#039;t help but notice that Jane was a bit fidgety as we caught up with things that had happened to each of us since we last saw each other, and she also asked after my daughters, so I gave her their phone numbers.…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Godfrey was sat on the train, reading his newspaper on his way home from a business trip. It was a two–carriage train and it was beginning to fill up, but the seat next to him was still empty, which pleased him. At the next station, however, several more passengers got on, including a very pretty blonde girl in her early twenties, who came and sat next to him. Godfrey shuffled up a bit to make room for the young lady. As the train pulled out of the station the young lady looked round and upon seeing that everyone was seated, she got up and went toward the toilet. She returned almost immediately and sat down looking a little irritated and uncomfortable. &quot;Typical of this damned rail company,&quot; she complained to…</p>
