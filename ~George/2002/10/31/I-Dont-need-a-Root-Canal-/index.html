                <p>Note: This story contains Male Desperation, Male Wetting and Humiliation<br />
I finally worked up the courage to have a public wetting &#8220;accident&#8221;. I decided on a mall as the location. I didn&#8217;t want to use a mall near my home for fear of being seen by someone I know, or worse yet someone who is friends with my wife. I had some errands to complete first; bank, post office etc. I drank water as I drove from one location to another. When it was time to drive to the mall I picked up two beers and another water for the ride. The mall is located in Dutchess County, New York, about 30 – 40 minutes from my home. As I was driving I could feel the pressure building.<br />
Driving on the highway kept my mind focused and I paid little attention to the building pressure. When I exited the highway and stopped at the first traffic light I became aware of the pressure. As I drove north on route 9, I had to stop for quite a few lights before I arrived at the South Hills Mall.<br />
By the time I was waiting at the light to turn into the mall I was pretty desperate. I parked and entered the mall through the Media Play store. Walking was easing my desperation. I decided to browse the shelves. Standing still because of unbelievable desperation, I wasn&#8217;t even seeing what I was looking at on the shelves. I exited the store and proceeded to walk around inside the mall. As I stopped to window shop, the pressure was really mounting. I decided to relieve the pressure and let a few squirts out, maybe 3 or 4 seconds worth. I was wearing jeans and pair of white cotton underpants. The underwear absorbed most of the pee, a faint wet mark appeared just below the fly of my jeans. I decided to sit down and see what kind of effect that would have on my bladder. The process of sitting caused pain around my bladder, making me feel quite desperate. I found myself fidgeting like crazy when tried to sit still; it was impossible to hold it in and a few more squirts ended up in my pants, but the stain on the front of my pants didn&#8217;t get any larger. I wanted to see if I could sit still without letting any pee out. I decided to see if I could remain still for as long as it took a woman that was about 100 feet away to reach where I was sitting. It was brutal, but I was doing pretty well. When she stopped to window shop, I was in agony but I was determined to sit still until she reached me. I was able to sit still, but I could not hold it any longer. As she was approaching I was letting squirt after squirt after squirt go. When she finally reached me I allowed myself to fidget. The wet spot on my jeans got only a little darker though. Then I felt it. The wet spot wasn&#8217;t getting darker because I was sitting!! I felt the warmness in the seat of my pants, and as I rose I could feel it with my hands. Oh my God – the wet spot was pretty big. I wanted to see if anyone would notice. I entered a dentist&#8217;s office located right inside the mall. I approached the counter to ask to use the bathroom. There were 5 or 6 people seated in the waiting room, and as I stood at the counter they could see my wet behind. I asked the receptionist if I could use their bathroom. She told me the mall bathroom was located in the middle of the mall and I told her that it was out of order.<br />
She directed me back to Media Play. I told her that I tried there but they had told me that it was for employees only. She told me that the dentist&#8217;s bathroom was for patients only, and then she told me to hold on, she was calling mall security to verify that the mall bathroom was out of order. I told her it was an emergency – and it really was!!! She just held up a finger and concentrated on dialing and listening to the phone ring. I hadn&#8217;t fidgeted since I entered, but the conversation kept me focused. I looked over my shoulder and I could tell that the patients in the waiting room were listening to my conversation. The receptionist was still on the phone, she was transferred to mall maintenance. I couldn&#8217;t hold it. I started to pee and I couldn&#8217;t stop it. I didn&#8217;t know what to do – I froze and I could feel myself turning red. The receptionist, I think, sensed something was amiss. She got up and pointed to the hallway and told me the bathroom was at the end.<br />
I told her it was too late. Either I said it too low or she couldn&#8217;t believe it. She said &#8220;<span class="caps">WHAT</span>??!!&#8221; I looked over my shoulder and could see the people staring at me. I looked back at her and just shook my head. She approached as I turned to leave. I was really embarrassed but I wanted to see the reactions of the people. They just stared in amazement. I heard the receptionist call one of her co–workers – &#8220;Hey, Sylvia, come look!&#8221; I left the office and started to walk toward the mall exit. As I rounded a corner, I could see 2 attractive women about 10 feet away. My predicament must have been very obvious – they just stared in disbelief. As I passed them I heard them giggling and when I turned to look at them, they had stopped walking and were staring and laughing. I went to my car and spent the 40– minute ride home in my soaked jeans. It was a very humiliating experience and definitely worth it.<br />
