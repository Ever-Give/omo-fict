        <p class="card-text">This story is based on real facts. (Everything related in it its true and happened some time ago).
On a fine sunny Friday of late May, my ex girlfriend and I decided to go on a trip to the mountains, just the two of us. (It was actually planned to make things work better between us.)
So on that Friday afternoon we went to the station and we took the train to Brasov situated 140 Kilometers from our city. From there we took a bus to the resort where we were going.
We arrived at about 6:00 pm, and we took out a room in a villa. Things were going really well. After settling down we went down to a club to spend our first evening. (This was at about 8:30 pm)
My girlfriend, Maria, was dressed in a nice pair of…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Birgit was starting to feel her bladder aching, as she tried to think of something else. She was sitting quietly in the middle of the boat, trying not to show her growing desperation. Birgit was part of a group of 3 boys and 4 girls on a boat trip to a small island in the middle of the Danube River, where they had visited an old castle. They had boarded the boat 3 hours ago, and since it was very hot, Birgit had drunk almost 2 liters of juice. Which was bad, because there had not been a loo on the island or on the boat. And so Birgit had been holding on since the urge to pee first hit her an hour ago. By now she was in great distress and having trouble hiding her need from the others. Not that the other girls…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Yesterday we had a night ski trip to a small ski resort with just one slope. We had a little race scheduled for 7, and due to heavy traffic, we didn&#039;t get there until 10 minutes prior to start. There were about 20 people in our group. There was heavy drinking going on during the bus ride, and right when we finally got there, several of the guys went straight out and peed in the snow. When I got out of the bus, I could see three girls starting to walk down to the little town to search for a bathroom, as I had hoped. But our leader shouted after them to come back, as we had to hurry to get to the start of the race. So we all got our skies and got to the lift quickly, and the race started. Everybody was to go…</p>
