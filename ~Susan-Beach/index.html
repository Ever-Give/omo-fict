        <p class="card-text">I had just broken up with my boyfriend and was a little depressed. To be honest, he had broken up with me. No big deal, he was hot, but that was all. Sex was great but we had no real connection. My girlfriend Courtney took it much harder than I did. She called me about a dozen times a day to make sure I was all right. I was!
About a week after the break–up she called and insisted that we have &quot;girl&#039;s night.&quot; I did not need one, but it seemed fun anyway.
She took me to the liquor store and insisted that we buy the best. She had more money than I so I let her pick the drinks. She worked for a law firm. Although she was only a secretary she seemed to run the place. Anyway, money was no problem for her.…</p>

        <p class="card-text">A few months ago my friend Melinda had given me a cigarette lighter. When she gave it to me I didn&#039;t smoke, so I thought it was a little weird. I guess because it led me to my first cigarette, I was not complaining– just curious. Why would she give such an odd gift?
I got the answer today.
Yesterday, Melinda and I were at the picnic table at school. We were just talking and gossiping as usual. As she did everyday, she opened the secret pocket in her book bag and pulled out a cigarette. She walked down to the &quot;smokers ditch&quot; and puffed away. As always, I followed her. As usual I seemed out of place in the smokers ditch. All of the others were Punks and Heads, the few that were lucky to have somehow gotten…</p>

        <p class="card-text">A few weeks earlier I had played sick and stayed home to avoid an algebra test. It was now about 10:00 pm on a Wednesday, and I was in bed but couldn&#039;t sleep. I was covered in blankets and nice and warm, but not quite warm enough. I was mildly horny because of a movie I had watched before going to bed. I did not recognize the star actor, but he was hot. At one point in the movie he kissed a beautiful redhead. I must admit that during the kiss scene I was more watching the redhead than the star actor. I wished I were she. She is so hot, with such a nice body.
So there I was, lying in bed thinking of a dramatic love scene. It was just instinctive that I rub myself. I rubbed and rubbed, and got really close to…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Okay, earlier I had peed my panties sitting on the toilet (part 1) and peed my jeans on the bed (part 2). This was the greatest day ever! I was sure I was still drunk after all the rum I drank, but I still had 9 hours before anyone got home. It is not very often I get the house to myself so I decided to use it to the fullest. I drank more rum, but kept it slow. I wanted to stay in the joyous state I was in. I wondered what naughty thing was left to do. Then it came to me; what was more arousing than smoking? I had taken a few puffs before with friends, but had never smoked a whole cigarette before. I imagined peeing, masturbating, and smoking. What more could I want? Mom thought that I didn&#039;t know she sneaked…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Earlier today I had my first wetting experience (Playing Sick), and I can&#039;t stop thinking about it! I remember the warmth forming between my legs. I remember orgasming like I never have before as the pee flooded my panties. It was the most orgasmic experience of my life, but I needed to make it better. Last time I peed on the toilet. This time I would need to do something more exotic!
I lay back on my bed, again trying to study for my test. After all, I do have a test today. I tried to think of equations, but all I could think of was the sight of that wonderful dark patch growing in my panties earlier today. My panties were white and the pee was wet; it felt so good. It even flooded my bottom as I sat on the…</p>

        <p class="card-text">I have an algebra test today, but I didn&#039;t study. This morning I woke up by the ringing of the alarm clock, but just knew I wasn&#039;t going to school. I am a senior, and failing this test could be the end of my academic career. I thought of a way out; I would pretend to be sick. I didn&#039;t do this often because I was a good girl... overall. I rarely needed to make excuses, but today was the exception.
The alarm rang for about three minutes before mom came in. She shook me, and asked me if I was awake. I was, of course, but I pretended not to be. After a few seconds, I rose suddenly, and sat up. I told mom of my upset stomach, and my throbbing head. She had no reason to doubt me since I almost never missed school.…</p>
