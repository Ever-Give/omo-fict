He watches her openly, appreciatively, from across the park. She is awkward, appearing unfamiliar with her body. Even so, he likes the way she moves. There is something there. She is no teenager with a perfect body, but he knows she could and has looked much better. He senses her weight is a recent development. John Alden knows things about women. She sees him looking her way but cannot even muster the thought that he is looking at her or finds her in any way attractive. She assumes he is watching RudeDog&#039;s antics. He thinks she is probably in her mid thirties and he is correct. Jenny Donner is 37. He thinks she is…</p>

Doctor Annabel Hart. The pretty young redhead&#039;s green eyes sparkled as she stared in amazement at the shingle hanging outside her office. She had thought, more than once, that this day would never come. Still, she had persevered, working long hours to support her schooling and even longer hours to pass medical school. The sleepless nights and heavy schedule had granted Annabel her most intense desire, but at the price of any social life. In fact she had no friends outside the stodgy little medical school she had attended. She thought it was worth it. Social opportunities would come when she…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Lee lies still, awake enough to know she needs to pee, but not enough to actually do anything about it. She watches as her friend Donna stirs in her sleep, moans, and goes quiet again. She and Donna are new friends; they have not yet learned the intimacies of the other&#039;s mannerisms and habits. Donna&#039;s covers are kicked back and Lee can see Donna&#039;s hand resting between her legs, where dark curls peek from under the crotch of her white panties. Donna&#039;s hand moves, ever so slightly, and she arches her back, just a bit.
Another moan. Lee wonders if the hand has anything to do with the moan. It doesn&#039;t surprise the 23–year–old blond to realize she, and apparently her nipples, like the idea that it does. She had…</p>

What was he doing here?? How had this happened!!?? The bailiff&#039;s voice continued, droning on in that official monotone reserved for officers of the law. Finally the explanation of charges was complete and the courtroom grew tense, quiet, as the judge&#039;s voice grimly intoned. &quot;How do you plead?&quot; Paul spat out the word &quot;innocent!&quot; in an exclamatory manner.

        <p class="card-text">Tamara Stevens hurried through her day, running late as usual. The 5&#039; 8&quot; tall 18–year–old college freshman was having a difficult time adjusting to life away from home. When she found herself short of time, it was usually her toilet visit that was sacrificed. Her busy class schedule, dorm living and pet–sitting job combined to leave the beautiful, bright, big bodied, but bodacious busted bubble–butt brunette&#039;s bladder being badly bursting before bathroom break (whew!) each day. Her bladder capacity did grow to accommodate her schedule, however, and became less a problem. At first, Tamara would rush to the dorm after classes to relieve her tortured body of its treasure of liquid gold, but as her capacity grew…</p>

That&#039;s right, he&#039;s no super hero, doesn&#039;t have a 12&quot; schlong, and wasn&#039;t the homecoming king. He is not the wettest diaper in the pail; I guess you could say among us pee folk. It&#039;s just that Harold is no more blessed with luck than he is with anything else. In fact, I would have to say he is good–luck challenged. Badly challenged. Ok, on a scale of 1 to 10, Harold needs a different scale.
Harold is married to the former Mildred Ann Natwick. Yes, that Mildred Ann Natwick, but they didn&#039;t meet until she was done with all that lesbian stuff, according to Harold. (I did mention he was prone to poor…</p>

The 54–year–old environmental technician normally has his time fully occupied with his two grown kids, his 14 year old, 2 grandkids and 2 more on the way.

Alexis Chambers looked with distaste into the toilet bowl as she dropped the square of pee–dampened tissue into the yellow water. How she hated it when she did that! So disgusting! She always tried not to look. The 41–year–old newly remarried widow hoped her new husband would be as proper about such matters as her previous husband had been. Odd, it was probably the only characteristic she had liked about her recently departed, unmissed, and unmourned mate. Her life had gone from merely livable to torturous over the 21 years she had been Mrs. Thadius Rushmore Monroe. She could hardly remember him now as the man…</p>

        <p class="card-text">At about 1 am, David wakes. The 55–year–old man is at once conscious of the insistent twinge of need brought on by a full bladder. He ignores it, noting the rush he gets as he grabs his stirring member to stem a stronger momentary urge. He pours a tall glass of water and gulps half of it at once while dancing in place. To the uninformed, his actions might appear at odds with sanity. He turns on the computer, checks email then browses through the special sites that interest him. The glass is empty now and he refills it. David downloads a couple of free utilities. He cannot get comfortable, dares not relax. Again the glass is empty. He knows he cannot refill it now without wetting himself. He tries to…</p>

        <p class="card-text">&quot;Hanna Evans, come on down!&quot; exclaimed the familiar voice. After more than two years of trying to get tickets, design a costume and the ordeal of auditions, the cute young housewife in the pigtails and the schoolgirl plaid skirt had often thought this moment would never come. Her white blouse and short, very short, skirt really accented her youthful figure. Hanna leapt to her feet and made her way to the stage, her plaid skirt flying, revealing glimpses of white cotton panty as she took steps two at a time. The camera operator, used to all manner of spectacle at the show, was distracted in spite of his experience and drew in close as Hanna&#039;s panties again made an appearance. &quot;Sweet, sweet, sweet!&quot; he spoke…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Zane Carson woke up feeling great! It was Saturday morning and he would be working on his house today. He needed to work in the attic and knew it would be best done early, before the Southern California sun turned the attic into an oven. Zane rolled out of bed, dressed and set up his ladder under the attic access door. He worked quickly, tossing all his materials, tools and water jug up into the opening. Ignoring the twinge in his bladder, Zane climbed the ladder and entered the attic. He was glad to see the generous vents at each end of his attic, which would help keep air moving. Zane had just settled in a Los Angeles suburb where he had obtained a good job in information technology. The active and fit 45…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Patty Richardson checked herself for the third time – ok, she had to admit that she really looked good. Her breasts flirted with the thin silky material of her blouse, tight against her nipples. She had no need of a bra and she liked the looks she got without one. Her long shapely legs looked even more remarkable under the tight mini. Her panties played peek–a–boo with her as she turned in the mirror, her perfect ass occasionally visible under the dress as she moved. Pretty short! She decided it was just right. The 28–year–old single mother worked long hours as a social worker and the mental anguish of the job often left her numb, but tonight was girls&#039; night out. She allowed herself this luxury about once a…</p>

He has heard the other traffic officers discuss seeing it from time to time, and has tried to get details without being &quot;too&quot; interested. His former patrol partner had pulled over a lady just last month for weaving in traffic. She had been about 28, pretty, and very drunk. She had gotten out of her car and flooded her panties while trying to walk a straight line. Jim had seen her at the station, but he could see nothing of her wetness; her dress had remained dry and he didn&#039;t think it would be wise to request a peek. Jim wants to see a genuine wet accident. He wants to pull over a…</p>

But, being fair to the mastodons, if she had come along first they would now be known simply as mastodons. She is, as they are called in polite society, a large and lovely, albeit hairy, lady. How large, you inquire? If she had been around when toilets were invented they certainly wouldn&#039;t have been put in a closet and the pipes would…</p>
