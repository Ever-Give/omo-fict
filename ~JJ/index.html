Day 2
The next morning Carie woke Linda up. &quot;I need to wash your leggings, or they will stain and smell.&quot; Linda dressed and gave her mother her leggings. After they walked down the stairs and into the kitchen Carie told Linda to sit down, they needed to talk. &quot;Dear, I can&#039;t thank you enough for showing me the wonders of peeing in your pants and I realise you want to do it often. Since I share that feeling I won&#039;t forbid you to wet yourself, but I do need to make a few rules for this. First, never do it on the wooden floors, they would bite out and the floor would be ruined. If you want you can go in the kitchen, but you need…</p>

Day 1 Finally it was the first evening of the festival. Ann and Linda had enjoyed themselves all day at the main event and now it was time to go for the walking. They had eaten at Linda her house (the four girls only, like each year, the husbands were at the terrain helping out as volunteers like each year) and now they had changed into the walking clothes and were ready to go out. They were all wearing the black glistering leggings, a lose t–shirt over it and sneakers with sneaker socks. The mothers had agreed it was a comfortable walking outfit and had happily paid for the whole package. Like each year they had backpacks with…</p>

Ann and Linda sat in Linda&#039;s room. They were talking about the week before when they had helped a girl overcome the taboo of peeing herself when she had to go so bad she was in extreme agony. They were also talking about the mother peeing herself to show the girl it was all right to pee herself. When they were all pissed the mother allowed the girl to pee herself when she wanted if it was possible to do it undetected and said she would be doing it as well. &quot;We need to find a way to make our mothers pee themselves with us. Perhaps they will like it too and allow us to do it when we want to so we don&#039;t have to hide our wet…</p>

The bus arrived and Ann and Linda got on. When they were sitting Ann looked around. They were sitting at the back of the bus and no one was near them. Ann leaned over to Linda. &quot;I do it here IF you promise to pee through your panties on the toilet in the mall.&quot; Linda thought about it for a few seconds. She was wearing black jeans so it wouldn&#039;t show a wet spot if she pulled her pants up to her wet panties. &quot;Deal, but I only promise to try, I don&#039;t know if I can do it!&quot;
Ann just got up a little bit and pulled her skirt out from her bottom. She sat back down, folded her skirt up so it wasn&#039;t conspicuous but clearly…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Ann was walking home from a night out with her best friend Linda. Both of them had gone to dinner, then the movies and some drinks afterwards. She was 18 years old so she only had diet coke the whole evening and she had to piss, piss badly!
When she wanted to go to the toilet in the bar Linda realised they were going to miss the last bus home if they didn&#039;t leave now. So they ran to the bus stop, jumped in and drove of. It was a 25–minute drive and she was getting more desperate each second. Though it felt she was going to have the urine pour out of her mouth soon she held on until the bus came to their stop. Linda also mentioned she had to pee badly but Ann knew she was worse. Linda had gone to the toilet…</p>

When I got home after college Eve and Ann were waiting for me in the living room. They had put a blanket on the floor and told me I had to stand on it while I peed my jeans. I felt so turned on. I had just come home, with my coat and backpack still on and I could wet my pants now. I didn&#039;t hesitate, without taking anything off I stepped on the blanket and slightly spread my legs. Ann said something like, &#039;Oh my God, she is going to do it completely dressed, with even her backpack on,&#039; and then I relaxed. I felt it coming soon enough. It erupted against my panties, making it jet back at…</p>

At work we have a strict policy. You can surf and mail work related and mail privately as well if it doesn&#039;t take up to much work time. Porn is strictly forbidden. As head of the IT department I had to check this from time to time. All Internet pages visited were logged on both who visited and how long they stayed if they were not in the approved list. I checked the log twice a week and if a site was clearly work related I added it to the list immediately. If it was on the edge of work related but not in violation of work codes (porn) I added it to a second list where the maximum visit…</p>

The next day my parents were going to a wine shop to get estimates on the worth of the wine. They were going with my grandparents and were planning on making a day out of it. I stayed behind and went into the secret area. When I was in the cellar I heard the doorbell and it was Monica. I opened the door from the inside and told her to come in through my living room. When she was with me she asked me why I wanted her to come in that way. I told her I didn&#039;t want anyone to find out about this secret place, so as few doors as we needed had to be used. The only door that opened inwards was my room; the…</p>

        <p class="card-text">It all started for me when I moved with my parents to the town my mother grew up in. We went living next to my uncle and aunt, but more importantly my niece Caroline. It was the beginning of the summer–vacation when we moved, so my parents had time to settle down in the new house before they had to start working again. This gave me the time to get to know the town a bit better and to make some friends before school started. Caroline showed me around and introduced me to some of her friends. We spent a lot of time together and grew quite close. One day we decided to go to the beach together, well beach is a somehow big word. It was a river with a bit of sand on the shores.

One day I had to go to a business meeting in another town. For this meeting one of my female co–workers had to go with me. This co–worker was a close friend of mine; I&#039;ll call her Amy. Amy and I were kidding around a lot of the time, and my boss tried to let us work together as little as possible, for we wouldn&#039;t do much at all if we were together all the time. We were however, the best people in the business and we had to close this deal. At work we had the joy of working with a lot of people, so they were sad to see us go.

        <p class="card-text">I&#039;d like to tell you about some of the strange things that happened to me after I went to college. I went to a different state, with two of my best friends, and our parents bought a house for us to live in. They did it on a few conditions. We had to maintain the building (they would pay back the bills, but we had to arrange the repairs and if we could do them ourselves. We had to progress in college, so no partying all night, each night. We had to come back home on a regular basis and finally we had to take care of the bills. We didn&#039;t have to pay rent, but they didn&#039;t give us any money to live off of (they did pay college tuition and our books and stuff). We thought it to be a good deal and we took it. We had…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Hi all,
It all started with me reading a lot of erotic stories about hypnosis on http://www.literotica.com.
I was intrigued by the idea of it, and turned on as well. I knew that it did not work like that, no–one does anything he or she normally would not do under hypnosis, but I decided to try to learn hypnosis never the less. I went to the library of a university and lent some of the books. I read trough them and learned nothing new. No luck there, so I wanted to get a few more. This time I did not go the general university library, but to the one of the physiology department. I looked around and found a very old book about hypnosis. It was so old, and written in such old language that no one hat lent it…</p>

Xander had become a bit paranoid over all the vampires and other monsters he knew existed since a few months. Yes, the friendship with Muffy and Willow and Cordelia was doing him both good and bad. Good since he wasn&#039;t such a geek anymore, bad because he found it difficult to adapt to the new world around him. He was constantly on the move, making hideout after hideout, believing monsters couldn&#039;t track him. But now he was under some sort of spell apparently.

        <p class="card-text">A few friends of mine came to me one day. They were having an argument about who was the most daring of them all and they wanted me to decide who it was. I thought that if I played my cards right I could be in for some fun. I&#039;m a guy, by the way.
I told them that I was prepared to be a sort of referee; however there were to be some ground rules. I wanted to be a witness to all challenges, or else I couldn&#039;t be fair. Secondly I wanted to stay friends with all of them so I said that I was going to be fair, and that they shouldn&#039;t get mad at me for making judgments. Thirdly– I wanted someone to be the most daring in at least 3 things, so it wouldn&#039;t be chance. Fourth– I knew two of them had a phobia and I didn&#039;t…</p>

We went to the football field to watch the school team practice. That was something we always did, but this time we went there more to pee our panties than to watch the game. We were sitting on the grass, our skirts out of the way and our legs up a bit. I counted down from 3 and we started to wet our panties at the same time. It felt great to pee in our panties with so many people around, and no one could see it. After lunch we went back to class, and the rest of the day I went to the toilet to pee trough my panties every chance I got, and more often than not I met…</p>
