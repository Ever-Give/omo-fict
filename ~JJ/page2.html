        <p class="card-text">This is Donna&#039;s story. I will tell it to you as she related it to us. One day, a few years ago Donna was outside with a few friends in the garden and they were all very giggly. At one point they were challenging each other to do all sort of things. Finally they challenged one of the girls to wet herself, which she did to her friends&#039; shock and laughter. They all laughed so hard that they almost ended up with wet pants.
A few days later she was in a store with one of those friends and she had to pee. Donna suggested to her that she could always pee her pants, just like the last time. Her friend suddenly got real nervous and giggly and asked Donna if she really meant that. Donna pressed the girl to just go in…</p>

        <p class="card-text">It all started when I went to a concert with my big sister. She had gone to a few concerts before, and it was my first time, so I looked to her to know what to do and what to wear. She told me to wear a knee–length skirt and thick panties underneath. On top I should wear something lose, not tucked into my skirt. I looked trough my wardrobe and found the outfit she described. When the big day finally arrived we went to the concert area early so we would have a real good spot. My sister told me to go to the bathroom now; for we wouldn&#039;t be able to go until the show was over if we wanted the spot. Of course I went, and I wondered how the hell I was going to last for 7 hours without peeing. We were three hours…</p>

        <p class="card-text">A few weeks after I had peed my jeans in the rain with my sister I was in the park with a good friend of mine, Jo–Anne. We were goofing around and having fun in the nice weather when Jo–Anne suddenly told me we had to find a toilet. She had had to pee for a while, as did I, and a bit escaped. We went to where the toilets were in the park, or rather, usually were. The city had apparently had had enough of the vandalism, and the toilets had been removed. Jo–Anne doubled over in pain and told me she&#039;d never make it home. She barely got here and she was about to pee her jeans. I felt sorry for her and told her she would be able to make it if she just tried. With a tear falling down her cheek she told me she couldn…</p>
