        <p class="card-text">When I finally completed my divorce and moved to Michigan, I was so happy to be away from ex in Florida and near my sister. After a month of being a single parent of three relocated teenagers, my sister and her husband invited me for a much–needed day on their powerboat.
It was a hot day so I drank a lot of water on the way. Because of the stress I had been under, they had lots of drinks prepared– a cooler full of beer, margaritas and bloody marys ready to go. I am not an alcoholic by any means, but I do love my happy hour.
The first hour was great, going up and down Lake Michigan. It got much cooler out on the lake but the more I drank the less it bothered me. It was really fun, until... It started as…</p>

        <p class="card-text">After taking some prescription medicine and then taking it easy for her recently unreliable bladder Patty decided to take a Saturday and go to the mall for some shopping. It was getting close to the holidays and she also really wanted to get out of the house. Her bladder had been fine the past week. Only once when she was out showing homes did she have to make any sort of effort to hold a full bladder.
She was dressed nice but casually by her standards. A plain white sweater and tan corduroys. The mall of course was very crowded and it took much longer to get her shopping done than she expected. She purchased a lot of gifts and by the time she was on line for her last purchase she really needed to pee. It had…</p>

        <p class="card-text">After experiencing more bladder problems in the last few weeks than ever before in their entire adult lives, Joan, Patty, George, and Paula each made an appointment with their local doctor to see what is wrong. They were told to arrive with their bladders full so to enable them to provide a fresh urine sample.
It is a windy rainy day and traffic is backed up for miles. Joan arrives at the office first, needing to pee very badly, although not yet desperate. She is wearing a blue sweater and dark grey slacks. She walks in trying to be as composed as possible– while taking slow, awkward steps over to the desk. As she waits for the receptionist to get off the phone she has her legs pressed together and is ever so…</p>

        <p class="card-text">The Tappan Zee is a 3–Mile long bridge on the Hudson River north of New York City. The traffic is always backed up and since there is no way off, I have often imagined people stuck and desperate. I have used my previous characters again and you can check out my other stories for their descriptions.
George, Patty, Joan and Paula are all sitting in traffic on the Tappan Zee Bridge, all having to pee so badly they don&#039;t to what to do. They are each coming home from a long holiday weekend and are casually, but nicely dressed. Joan is wearing a white sweatshirt with a sailboat on it, a pink sweater tied around her shoulders and tan shorts. George is wearing a reddish/pink button down shirt and tan slacks. Patty is…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Paula is a woman I used to work with in the office of a furniture store. She is in her late forties, pretty with sort curly blonde hair and blue eyes and glasses. However, her looks also reveal a hard life having her husband leave her and supporting a child on her own through a series of low–end clerical jobs where she was never treated well. I saw her need to pee badly at one time and this story feeds off of that event.
&quot;When will this lady get of the phone?&quot; Paula thought to herself. The woman on the line who kept on talking allowed Paula to at least focus on what was now becoming an urgent need to pee. It was 3:00 and all the coffee at lunch plus the many trips to the water cooler seemed to hit her bladder…</p>

        <p class="card-text">I now present a story of male desperation. While I am strictly heterosexual, I have often been interested in male desperation– mostly concerning men who are middle aged to older, grey haired and distinguished. This is based on a true story that was told to me by a relative who knew this man. She described him as resembling the actor George Kennedy.
&quot;Damn I gotta go,&quot; George thought to himself as he gritted his teeth and squirmed in his seat. He had been sitting in a massive traffic jam on the Palisades Parkway as he was driving in to work. The drive into New York usually took 1/2 hour but he had now been sitting in traffic for well over an hour and the coffee and juice with breakfast was now catching up to…</p>

        <p class="card-text">I continue my theme of female desperation with a middle aged, well to do, well–dressed woman caught short in at least a semi public situation. I continually tire of stories about younger women that are provocatively dressed.
What a nightmare. Joan was sitting in her car and the traffic was backed up for miles; there seemed to be no way off the rural road she was stuck on, a combination of rain and sleet was pouring down, but worst off all... she had to go to the bathroom! Badly!!!
She had been to a dinner party with other people from her office where she had imbibed lots of wine and coffee. While she dutifully used the ladies&#039; room before she left, most of the liquid she had consumed hadn&#039;t reached her…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Patty looked at her watch and realized she had 10 minutes to catch her train. She could not finish the rest of her errands today, nor stop to find a ladies room. Her need to pee was not urgent, but she would rather not use the toilet on the train.
Although Patty was pushing 60, she did not look it and was very attractive. She has shoulder length dark hair and naturally tanned dark skin and small but perky eyes. Her looks are the hallmark of many of the well–off Jewish women in the New York area. Unlike many of these women however, she chose to start her own business and not live totally off her husband. Being an owner gave her some liberties, like today. Taking the entire day off to go to a Broadway Matinee.…</p>
