        <p class="card-text">I eventually got into the habit of mostly holding on all day at school and not going to the toilet. I think this probably started from spending so much time with the boys. While girls often tend to go to the toilet together, boys are much more haphazard. For example, if we were in the middle of a game of cricket or something during lunch time we&#039;d keep playing as long as we possibly could after the bell rang, and only when it was too late to go would I realize I really could have done with a visit to the toilet. The only acceptable option then would be to just hold on for the rest of the afternoon, which I always managed to, refusing to ask to be excused during class. Having always been quite a tomboy I was…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Hi there fellow pee–pee enthusiasts, This is my first contribution, as I only came across this amazing site a couple of weeks ago. Now I know I&#039;m not the only secretly weird one; I had no idea there is so many others fascinated by pissing!
