Part Two
This picks up where Part One left off, obviously. So if you haven&#039;t read that, scroll down and catch up on your reading. This part will make a teeny bit more sense, maybe not much, but some. This portion here contains a little bit of, shall we say, consensual roughness between the two imaginary lovers. If you&#039;re uncomfortable with that, move on. Or even if you don&#039;t think you like it, try reading it. Gosh, you know sometimes we&#039;re surprised at what we find out about ourselves.
***
&quot;I&#039;m totally serious. No more until we get home,&quot; I said. But looking down at your skirt, already soaked in various places, I knew I&#039;d never be able to tell if you were behaving.

Part One
Finally back at my hotel you hobble across the deserted lobby, hanging onto me. You&#039;re bent far forward, cute breasts thrust out. Your bladder is so, so very stretched out, aching, straining, bulging visibly in your abdomen in the visible inch of bare flesh between your shirt and the jean cutoffs.
And then the feeling in your little pussy, like a white hot knife blade pressing down from inside, that enormous quantity of pent up pee needing to get out of your little burning pee hole. Your whole body is trembling. Your inner bare thighs and the crotch of your denim shorts are wet, your free hand straying unashamedly to clutch your crotch and squeeze. The desk clerk looks up and stares, but you&#039;re…</p>

        <p class="card-text">I opened the car door, grabbed her by the hand, and pulled her roughly out of the car. &quot;Look at you, you slut!&quot; I yanked down the top of her knit dress exposing her titties. She was bent forward pressing her hands against her pussy. &quot;Lean on the car,&quot; I said, twisting her to face the car. She was squirming and wiggling. &quot;I can&#039;t believe you just peed in my car,&quot; I said. I tugged her tiny dress up exposing her panties. I could see her crotch was moist and still dripping. &quot;Goddamn it, I can&#039;t believe you just pissed in my car. And look at you, wet panties and all.&quot; Her back was arched, her butt sticking out, grinding in mid–air. &quot;I couldn&#039;t help it,&quot; she said whining, &quot;I have to pee so bad it hurts!&quot; &quot;Hold still…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Kathy came home very late, ran in the door and right past me, ignoring my angry questions as to where she&#039;d been. I ran after her as she beelined for the bathroom. I insisted she stop and explain herself. But she was in the bathroom, already tugging her panties down and her skirt up, pee squirting from her cute little bottom even before it touched the toilet seat. In the quiet bathroom the hissing sound seemed as loud as the brakes on a bus. She closed her eyes. She looked very drunk. &quot;Oh, I didn&#039;t think I was going to make it,&quot; she said. She parted her legs slightly, closed her eyes, and leaned her head back. Through the narrow gap between her legs I could see her stream shooting straight forward, nearly…</p>
