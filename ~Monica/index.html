She was laying there, in her nice, warm bed, with her comfy terrycloth pyjamas on, her heart hammering against her chest. &quot;I need to get up,&quot; she thought. &quot;I need to go to the bathroom, quickly!&quot; &quot;I can&#039;t move. I just can&#039;t, or I will pee the bed&quot; was the immediate afterthought.

        <p class="card-text">It was a very hot day when Sally went back from her basketball game. The temperature was way above 30 degrees Celsius and she was wearing a tank top and light blue jeans. She was regretting now, that she hadn&#039;t put on a skirt instead of the jeans, but the morning had been a lot cooler.
