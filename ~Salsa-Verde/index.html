        <p class="card-text">Daniela was a model for a car club in her state. Today she was leaving a photo shoot dressed in tight black short shorts, pink pantyhose, a pink tube top, and pink heels. During the shoot she had drank plenty of water due to how hot it was out, and by the time they were wrapping she felt the first few twinges telling her she needed to find a bathroom. 
Driving towards home she remembers that she needs to stop by Walmart to pick up a few things, all the while sipping on a large 2–liter bottle of water. By the time she pulls into the parking lot her bladder is under siege by all the water she drank, and she knows she needs to find a bathroom, but she thinks she can hold it until she gets home, so she grabs a…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Jeanine was a girl I went to school with back in high school. She, to me, was beautiful, about 5 foot 7, maybe 140 pounds, short black hair, brown skin, a body not too thick but not too thin. What caught me about her was for someone who tried too hard to act too good for me, she really made a lot of bad choices in men back then. 
It was a little into February when she told the class a story about how when she was younger she would hold it as long as she could, run up to the top stair of her apartment building, then cross her legs and pee her pants.
