        <p class="card-text">I&#039;ve had quite a few boyfriends, but nothing very serious. With Paul I knew from the beginning it would be different. He was good–looking, intelligent, had similar interests to mine, but above all he was kind, thoughtful, considerate. I really felt this as going to be something special.
I like to take things slowly, and our first two dates ended with no more than a chaste kiss. On the third date we went to a movie, and then to the pub. Half way through our second pints he suggested, rather shyly, that I might like to come home with him. Although I tried not to show too much enthusiasm, I accepted straightaway – indeed, I should have been very disappointed if he hadn&#039;t asked. We finished our drinks, and Paul…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Ann was walking home from a night out with her best friend Linda. Both of them had gone to dinner, then the movies and some drinks afterwards. She was 18 years old so she only had diet coke the whole evening and she had to piss, piss badly!
When she wanted to go to the toilet in the bar Linda realised they were going to miss the last bus home if they didn&#039;t leave now. So they ran to the bus stop, jumped in and drove of. It was a 25–minute drive and she was getting more desperate each second. Though it felt she was going to have the urine pour out of her mouth soon she held on until the bus came to their stop. Linda also mentioned she had to pee badly but Ann knew she was worse. Linda had gone to the toilet…</p>

I had only just managed to jump on the tube before the doors shut, and I didn&#039;t need to go too badly then. Besides I thought I could use the loo here. The sign said the nearest public toilet was at Nightingale Road. I knew where that was, but, it was half a mile in the opposite direction from home. It was just getting dark and I should have been home at 5 o&#039;clock, it was now 5:15. Dammit! I would just have to hold it and walk the two miles home.
At 19 years old it seemed a bit much having to tell mum what time I would be home. But she worries, and it was only polite to tell her a time, I suppose. I had been sure…</p>

This is another real life experience from me :)
When I had finished cleaning up after my first accident, I was still pretty confused... I mean, I&#039;m not supposed to wet my pants when I&#039;m almost 20 years, how could such an odd thing be the best turn–on ever? I still haven&#039;t figured that one out, but I stopped bothering. It&#039;s the best feeling ever, I don&#039;t care if I can&#039;t explain it as long as I love it!
Anyway, I had two full days alone still, and it&#039;s not often I get the opportunity to be alone like this. Also, with school over for the week and no particular homework I needed to care about, I had nothing to do…</p>

Cindy quietly cursed each cup of coffee she had drunk on that cool, busy morning. It was almost 9 a.m. and the parade was about to begin. Her uncomfortably full bladder worried her. Could she hold on for the hour or more the parade would take before ending at a shopping center 2 miles away? 
&quot;Damn, damn, damn,&quot; she said under her breath while pressing her thighs together. &quot;And I don&#039;t even like coffee,&quot; she said ruefully.
The morning had not gone well. She had awakened at 5 a.m. with just four hours sleep after partying with friends the night before. She had a slight hangover and immediately gulped down a cup of coffee to get…</p>

Going on holiday to Cyprus was supposed to be so much fun! My friends, Alice and Barbara had talked me into the idea, but I had my doubts from the start.
&quot;Come on Janice, why don&#039;t you join us on holiday before we all go off to university! It will be great – promise you!&quot;
The first day was quite nice, exploring the coast, and lazing in the warm sun, but I found the evening hell! To be honest, I guess I was just not very good at mixing with people, and I really couldn&#039;t bear the idea of getting disgustingly drunk!
That first night we all three went into Paphos town and ended up at a big, noisy disco–bar…</p>

This had a lot to do with the fact that she wasn&#039;t either of those things but there was something about her. She was just a regular girl who wore what she wanted. The teachers, male and female, tried everything; sending her home to change and she would come back in a different crazy outfit, making her wear the school uniform, she would just cut it short. 
Even though she was 18 and a senior the staff felt that she shouldn&#039;t wear such things in high school.…</p>

Natalie had long dark auburn hair and was a slightly plump but pretty girl in her late teens who had a crush on me, despite the fact that I am about 20 years or so her senior. I often visited her parents at their home and Natalie would almost always sit next to me on the sofa. On a couple of occasions she had shown me something of her body, and strangely her parents hadn&#039;t objected. The first occasion was when her mum came in with some new clothes for her. She immediately took them out of the bags and held up a blouse and a bra. Without further ado she stood up, facing me, and removed her top and bra, her ample 38DD breasts bouncing…</p>

Val was fashion modelling, and now helps run an agency. When she first came over here from Italy, she worked in an antiques shop in between assignments. I met her there when I was a student and we got on pretty well. As she was new in England I helped her out with quite a few things. After six months she even had to move in with me, as she had got herself involved with a really dodgy landlord and didn&#039;t feel safe.
We were just friends at this stage, but any bloke would have wanted more, and I was happy to work my way slowly into her affections. Then as luck would have it, two bombshells landed in quick succession.…</p>

        <p class="card-text">I have always been interested in wet pants. It started when I was quite young, and I have never lost interest, even after 40 odd years!
I have wet myself more often than I can remember over the years. Sometimes fully peeing my knickers and making a puddle on the ground, but mostly just a bit wet, enough to show on tight jeans if you were looking for it! 
When I&#039;m feeling naughty though, I like to wait until the last possible minute to go to the loo. Most times I don&#039;t wet much, but I&#039;m often squirming and wriggling about trying not to pee myself, and doing the pee dance. I like the feeling of intense anticipation bordering on panic as I get towards not being able to wait much longer. Sometimes, particularly…</p>

Over the years, the wife and I have had a lot of wetting experiences with other parties and privately. We never wrote about these, choosing to be anonymous at her request. She&#039;s passed away now, and I&#039;m too old to be intimidated anymore so here it comes.
First of all, we determined there were TWO kinds of pee. Ordinarily the kidneys filter blood and send the waste to the bladder. This contains, among other things, acetic acid also known as vinegar, and this gives it the yellow tint you see. We called this DIRTY PEE. However, if you drink a lot of liquid in a relatively short time (guzzling NOT recommended…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Barbie was a great partner for lots of reasons, good sex being among them. In fact, she thoroughly enjoyed a variety of sexual experiences and positions.She thought nothing of parading naked in front of others and sometimes me. In fact, she was open and natural in everything except her bathroom habits, where she was a real prude.
&quot;Peeing is NOT a spectator sport,&quot; she&#039;d say emphatically as she closed the bathroom door. In several years of going together, I&#039;d never seen her on a toilet or squatting in the woods or anywhere else. Unlike other women I&#039;ve known, who thought nothing of squatting behind a bush or beside the car when nature called, Barbie always closed the bathroom door and managed to hold it…</p>

Note: This story contains Female Desperation, Accidental &amp; Deliberate Wetting, and Masturbation.
My first experience with pee fun was when I was younger. I woke up at about 7am and lay there for a while as it was Saturday and I didn&#039;t have to be anywhere. After 5 minutes I was hit with a sudden urge to pee that made me cross my legs together under the sheets; however the urge went away as quickly as it came and I fell asleep again.
I woke again half an hour later by an even bigger urge to pee as I had ignored the first one. Carefully but quickly I climbed out of bed but as I stood up some pee squirted out, enough to make a large coin sized patch on my panties. I managed to stop the flow and…</p>
