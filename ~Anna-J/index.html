        <p class="card-text">It started off as just a regular Saturday: playful, passionate morning sex followed by a movie and an early lunch. My boyfriend and I have been dating for several months now but we still have that new relationship excitement.
I&#039;ve never told him about my desperation fetish but I think he&#039;d find it gross. He&#039;s as macho as he&#039;s totally hot, and I don&#039;t want to take the risk. The closest I get to involving him is being slightly full during sex sometimes, simply to increase my own pleasure.
Being into desperation gives me the advantage of not genuinely being caught short too often. But today I overlooked the effect of &quot;breaking the seal&quot;. I previously thought that this only happened with beer but learned the…</p>

        <p class="card-text">There was a new Mexican place that my friend insisted I just had to try. I had my doubts since she&#039;s never been into spicy food. Then it dawned on me. Tammy broke her ankle a few days back and she probably had a bad case of cabin fever. There was no way I could turn her down, even in the middle of a busy Sunday.
I have to admit Tammy looks very cute on crutches. She&#039;s petite and wears these pleated mini skirts that give her the prep school girl look even though we&#039;re older than that. Everyone was very courteous at the restaurant, holding the door open for her and giving her sympathetic smiles.
I&#039;m technically hotter, but she looks younger and more endearing. I was glad I wore my tank top and really short…</p>

        <p class="card-text">As I mentioned previously, my original story was based on true events but not quite. What is true is that I am twenty and The Diet really has taken off at my office causing some pretty interesting events – well it&#039;s of interest to me anyway. While I am heterosexual something about seeing someone (regardless of gender) desperate to pee makes me crazy.
Anyway, at the office there is this girl Hannah who is very pretty but not exactly a rocket scientist and is kind of full of herself. The truth is that I doubt we&#039;d talk if we didn&#039;t go to the same gym. She came over to me the other week and casually asked me if I thought The Diet made me better at holding it. I replied that yeah, of course it did since it makes…</p>

        <p class="card-text">I drank quite a bit this afternoon and now sitting at my desk, still in my work clothes, fully conscious of the way my bladder is filling. I&#039;m at the point where I&#039;m only slightly uncomfortable – I fidget from the time to time and although I try to keep my thighs from touching they snap together when I&#039;m not being vigilant.
Oh how I love this. Figured it was a good time to introduce myself. I&#039;m a closet case. Twenty years old and my boyfriend doesn&#039;t know a thing about this little obsession of mine. I am very secretive about it. But I feel like sharing this bit of myself with you.
Ever since I realized that being desperate gives me a huge thrill, I started experimenting with it. Drinking a lot in school and…</p>

        <p class="card-text">She rapped loudly at the door. &quot;What&#039;s taking so long? Get out already!&quot;
I was mildly annoyed. What was this woman&#039;s problem? It was Marie&#039;s voice, I realized. That particular co–worker of mine was a little uptight – especially since she lost that weight – but I brushed it off and figured she was just cranky. This was a bit much, though. I had only been in the bathroom for a minute.
&quot;Can&#039;t a girl pee in peace?&quot; I said loudly, my bladder leisurely emptying.
&quot;HURRY UP!&quot; she almost shouted. &quot;You&#039;re such a selfish pig! Don&#039;t you realize you&#039;re not the only female who pees in this office?&quot;
Now I was mad. True there was only one bathroom for each gender but gosh she didn&#039;t have to talk like that. I finished,…</p>
