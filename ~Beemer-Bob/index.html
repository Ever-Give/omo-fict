        <p class="card-text">This morning, I awoke with my hand firmly gripped on my rock hard member. I don&#039;t know what I had been dreaming about or what caused this amazing hard on but it sure felt wonderful. It was particularly nice this morning because I really had to pee badly– very badly. In fact, I couldn&#039;t tell if I was about to cum or pee. In either event I was going to leave my sleepy wife in bed and go get some relief in the bathroom.
In the same second as I was about to throw off the covers and roll out, She turned towards me, flopped her arm down on my stomach and laid her hand across my dick. It seems she was about to wake up too and suddenly realized how big and hard I was. I couldn&#039;t tell her about how much I had to pee…</p>

        <p class="card-text">I work in a real estate office and I get to meet and interact with all kinds of great folks. Having spent all my life in the retail business both working with and watching people, I&#039;ve learned how to feed my fetishes by setting up scenarios without the players knowing what&#039;s going on. I know it&#039;s devious but I can&#039;t help myself as they just sort of fall into the act. Sometimes this talent comes in handy when you have some of the fetishes we all seem to enjoy.
We often hold public open houses where we will open up a home and let the public tour it. It gives us the chance to meet new buyers and to help market a property we have listed. Sometimes those listed properties are new homes that have been built in…</p>

        <p class="card-text">One of the great things about being a middle–aged dad is having older teenage kids. They are fun at that age and they like it when dad loses the &quot;grown up speaks to child&quot; demeanor and becomes one of them for a moment or two.
In her 18th year, my middle daughter was a real knockout. She was tall and slender and kept after herself. As I look back, I miss all those girly things like shampoo and perfume smells, her music playing and her giggling with her friends when she filled the house with other pretty teens. Sometimes her friends would do the courteous thing and say hello to &quot;the Dad&quot; or give a nod or wink. What these kids choose to wear, or not to wear today makes me crazy and I confess, I get really hot…</p>

        <p class="card-text">This is an adaptation of a true story––– some things have been altered a bit for better flavor.
The last time I got together with my friend Carol, it was a chance meeting that had us both on my motorcycle in the mountains and finished with the best sex ever. Carol was determined that we would meet again, only on her turf next time...
Well, It so happened that I had to go on a trip to visit a relative and it put me just a few hours from where Carol was now living. I called her to let her know and she was really excited. She started to tell me all the things she was going to plan and I had to shut her up. I wanted to be surprised instead.
This time, I followed the directions to where Carol was going to be and…</p>

        <p class="card-text">I have had this girlfriend for almost two years now but it has been just phone sex and hours of Internet foreplay. But... not long ago, we had the pleasure of a wild afternoon interlude and unbelievable watersport fun. This is a true story but it could be dangerous, so I wouldn&#039;t recommend it to everyone.
Twenty–five years ago, we lived in the same town and we were lovers and roommates at the time but it just wasn&#039;t right for a long–term relationship. We broke up and I never heard from her again. She was really wonderful; it was I who was the jerk.
Almost two years ago though, I found her on line as I was surfing some Internet site–– I couldn&#039;t believe it. We spent nearly a year getting caught up on the…</p>
