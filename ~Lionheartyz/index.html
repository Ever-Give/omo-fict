        <p class="card-text">Something was very wrong with the world today...why is the sky purple, why are the trees green, why am I surrounded by Smurfs, oh well. Ashley skipped through the forest oblivious to everything around her, and then it hit her. Sheesh, I gotta pee pretty badly. Oh there is a toilet right next to that tree, she thought. When she got to the toilet the lid wouldn&#039;t open. &quot;What&#039;s wrong with this stupid thing? Wait, why is there a toilet in the forest?&quot; But at this point she really didn&#039;t care, she needed to go and now. *BANG* *BANG* *BANG*! &quot;What was that noise??&quot; The world started to get fuzzy. *BANG* *BANG* *BANG*!!! The world was getting black...
She opens her eyes and Drill Sgt. Gomez is staring right at her,…</p>

        <p class="card-text">It was graduation day and Ashley and her friends were all bouncing from one class to another saying one last good–bye to all their favorite teachers before they headed off into their unsure futures. Ashley was still unsure as to what she was going to do for her future, she was hoping on a scholarship to college because it was her only way in. Her family wasn&#039;t poor but with four other sisters her parents could not afford to send anyone to college, so she tried to do everything she could to get a scholarship, not really because she cared about her education but because she didn&#039;t want to miss out on the college life.
