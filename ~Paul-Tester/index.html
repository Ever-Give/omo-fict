Amy was quietly proud of her huge bladder, and while she did not openly boast of her capacity, she liked to show off, by casually dismissing the chance to visit the loo, saying &quot;No thanks. I don&#039;t need to do that.&quot; When Joan had called at Amy&#039;s house that morning it had not been co–incidence that she had been offered several mugs of tea while they were waiting for a lift to the coach departure point. Naturally Amy had not been for a pee before leaving, nor had she offered Joan the chance. Amy knew that Joan usually needed to pee far more often than she did, and was surprised that she did no ask to use the loo before they left She might have hoped that Joan would suggest a &#039;last minute&#039; pee, so she could…</p>

She had somehow got down the steps into the subway, blindly following Amy, convinced that this was the way to the Ladies she so urgently needed, and now nothing; just a long passageway leading to some more steps, the walls blank, with only a few advertisements and not the door to the ladies that she had to find. To confirm her misery that this was not where the Ladies was, Amy, her friend who knew the way to the Ladies, was starting to climb the steps, leading up to&#039; where? The Ladies?

&quot;Waiting, but for how long?&quot;
At last the coach was stopping– pulling up at the side of the road, not a proper coach stop, but just a bit of pavement near Oxford Street. Frantic, not able to think of anything except finding a loo, Joan looked desperately around for the sign she so wanted to see: &quot;Ladies,&quot; or &quot;Public Lavatories.&quot;
Nothing! Nowhere was there the slightest sign of a public loo, the loos she had been praying to get to for the last hour and which had become the centre of her existence for the last fifteen minutes.
The awful reality of the situation suddenly struck Joan; she was going to have to stand up and walk off the coach, then walk along…</p>

Sitting on the coach, desperate to pee, Joan was trying everything she knew to help herself wait, to contain the pee in the bursting bladder, to hold back the pressure that was reaching danger level.
Without meaning to, her hand had slipped down from her aching bladder area and into her lap. These thoughts of a loo had made her want to pee more urgently, so, she was horrified to find, she was pressing both hands between her twisted legs. Realising what she was doing made her pull her hands away quickly, before anyone could see what she was doing. She wanted to pee so badly! But, she reminded herself, women of her age did not hold themselves in public, in…</p>

Could there be anything worse on a coach outing? Joan wondered.
She was dying to go to the loo and did not know when she was going to be able to? It was one of those nightmare situations that she dreaded and always pretended would never happen to her. As she looked out of the coach window at the passing London suburbs, Joan tried to recognise where they were and wondered anxiously how much longer it would be before they stopped for a loo break.
In fact, although she did not want think about it, the real question was; how much longer she could wait until she absolutely had to get to a loo? She seemed to have been sitting for ever with her legs crossed,…</p>

Vanessa and her partner Keiran, who lived in a remote English country village, often had a group of friends to stay for the weekend, and on Saturday night had arranged a visit to their favourite pub in a nearby village. A late–night bus connecting all the villages in the area had recently been started, and Vanessa insisted that they use this to come home, instead of driving or ordering a taxi. The pub was famous for both real ale and local cider, so they were all expecting to have plenty to drink.
Vanessa, a well–built girl in her 30&#039;s, was wearing a long, close fitting dress, which clearly showed the outline of her knickers. Kieran…</p>

As a divorcee of 30, Lindsay was flattered when one of the younger men at work asked her to join a group of his friends going to the rugby match. The group consisted of two other couples who were all in their 20&#039;s. The other two girls were Tracy, about 25, slim with dark hair and thick glasses, which spoiled her looks, and Belinda, well built, a blonde about 28. Both were casually dressed, Tracy in the tightest pair of jeans you could imagine, and Belinda in a denim mini–skirt, which was both short and tight. Lindsay had also gone for the casual look, wearing jeans, not as tight as Tracy&#039;s with a sweater and anorak. As you might expect from a rugby crowd, they met in a pub…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Like most girls of 18 with an older boyfriend, Jane was often anxious to impress him and not to seem too young when out with his other, older friends. She was desperately attracted to Mark, who was 27 with a good job and his own flat, and was going do to everything in her power to keep him. She was delighted when they were going on a coach outing to see their local rugby club play in a final, as it would mean a whole day out together. She was not very keen on some of Mark&#039;s rugby friends, but she would put up with this and show him how much she was a rugby enthusiast.

        <p class="card-text">As a South African working in England, Sonia wanted to see her national team when they were touring, and she was delighted when one of her office colleagues, Tony, a dedicated rugby fan, offered to include her in the party he was organizing to the England v. South Africa match at Twickenham. Tony was a regular at Twickenham internationals, and the group followed his usual plan to avoid the worst of the crowds– travel by public transport, stop at a little–known pub, and then walk to the ground. As well as Tony and Sonia, there were two other couples, both about Tony&#039;s age, while Sonia was about ten years older. She was a tall, well–built, girl of 35, with short blonde hair, and was wearing a knee–length tweed…</p>

        <p class="card-text">All stories contain female desperation, frantically searching for the Ladies&#039;, except for one male incident.
Sometime ago I wrote about my sightings of desperate women when I was working on a motorway service area. (See &#039;The Motorway Service Area&#039;) Some of the best sightings came from coaches on shopping trips before Christmas, so the next year I decided to see where they were going. The coaches were dropping their passengers at a small open space where several major roads met at the edge of the main, pedestrian, shopping area. This open space was crossed by several footpaths and underground pedestrian crossings (called subways in England), and had badly signposted public toilets. Since this open area, hardly…</p>
