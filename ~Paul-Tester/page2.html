        <p class="card-text">Jenny, as the only women driver who worked for the coach company, always liked to arrive early, both to avoid any criticism in a male dominated job, and to give herself time to get ready before taking her coach out. Hence she wasn&#039;t happy when the yard manager was waiting as she arrived.
&quot;Change of plan, I&#039;m afraid, Jenny,&quot; he greeted her. &quot;Bill has gone sick, so you&#039;ll have to do his job, it&#039;s urgent, there&#039;s nobody else here yet. The coach is outside ready, fuelled and everything, instructions on the wheel. Better get moving– you haven&#039;t got much time.&quot;
He pointed to a coach parked opposite and turned away with a parting &quot;Good girl, you&#039;ve saved my life!&quot; before Jenny had a chance to say anything. She…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Some time ago I had a temporary job trying to sell motoring services and products on a motorway service area. The marketing organization I was working for thought that motorists stopping for a break would be a soft target and a captive market. In fact it was a thankless and badly paid job, and most people soon became disheartened and left. I stayed longer than anyone, despite the miserable job, because a few of the people arriving at the service area were desperate for a pee, and this job paid me to stand around and watch for this. Below are the best of these sighting, collected over about six months, together with my thought on what I saw. All of these are true sightings, and I apologize in advance for the…</p>

        <p class="card-text">I guess that most of us with small bladders try to keep that fact hidden, or at least not advertise it more than we have to. Of course, I know that it is part of my nature, nothing to be ashamed of any more than mousy hair, small boobs or uneven teeth, but there isn&#039;t, as far as I know, a urinary equivalent of hair coloring, silicone implants, or cosmetic dentistry. (A bladder extension? Yes please! Would my health insurance cover that?) Maybe I am ultra–sensitive to this because I work in the marketing division of a competitive, male dominated, company, where I have to be better just to hold my own, so anything that might distract from perfection, such as popping to the loo too often, has to be avoided.…</p>

&quot;My troubles started when we were having a drink in the evening. I got into a stupid argument with Sharon, and we had a drinking contest, seeing who could drink a pint the fastest, and then immediately a rematch changing drinks, so I drank lager and Sharon bitter. (Sharon is a white girl who always seems to rub me up the wrong way. If I had not already been drinking I would have ignored her, like I usually do. It would have been much better if I had.)

Lucy–Anne was a Filipino nurse, tiny, like so many Asian girls. She told me she was 27 but at a casual glance she could easily have passed for 16 or 17. On the outing she had been wearing dark blue stretch denim jeans that fitted her slim body really well.
&quot;This was the first outing I had been on, since I had only joined St Luke&#039;s 3 months ago. In the evening I tried cider for the first time, and I really enjoyed it, and drank quite a lot.

        <p class="card-text">Introduction
Some of the nurses at our local hospital recently held a coach outing to the coast, which was a journey of about two and a half hours. A good friend of mine was on the outing, and knowing my interest in the subject, she told me about the emergency stop on the way back. Even though nurses are reputed to have exceptionally big bladders, a number of them needed the loo desperately as they had been in a pub for some time before leaving. In fact her words were &quot;I have never seen so many desperate women trying to get into a small public loo, and from the time it took for us all to go, I doubt if any coach has ever held so much pee.&quot;
When I asked her for more details, she offered to do better than give…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Sister Loraine&#039;s Story
Loraine was the nursing sister who had organized the outing. In her late thirties, average height with a trim, rounded figure with short blonde hair she was the image of efficiency you would expect for a senior nurse. On the outing she had been wearing a rather short, tight–fitting fawn skirt.
&quot;Everything went really well all day until the last hour, when it was difficult to get some of the nurses out of the pub, and we were late leaving. The driver started complaining about having to work late, an attitude which annoyed me, so I rather abruptly told him that if he turned up in St Luke&#039;s A &amp; E needing treatment, he would expect us to work overtime if needed, so he could do the same for…</p>

If the original author reads it, or anyone has the complete original version, I would like to have a copy, to see what really happened. The events remind me of the times when I used to drink in the West End of London at weekends, and it was possible to see at least one good desperation scene, though not up to this standard, almost every week.

        <p class="card-text">When I was a student I spent some time on an exchange scheme in Germany and part of this time was spent in Berlin. One day our group was taken on a coach tour of East Berlin. We set off at 8.00, right after breakfast in the hostel canteen. I was pleased to find that I was sitting next to Daniella, a pleasantly rounded Dutch girl who I had noticed before. She filled her skin–tight jeans to perfection, and the outline of her low–cut 1&quot; knickers was clearly visible. Her T–shirt showed she was not wearing a bra. We chatted away freely as we passed through the checkpoint and into the Eastern Zone. We started talking in German, as we were supposed to, but Daniella soon asked me to use English as she was much more…</p>
