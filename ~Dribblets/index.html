        <p class="card-text">They decided to clean up and head on over to the food court. They got some burgers, and sat down at the table, where they discussed what had just happened.
&quot;That was fucking hot,&quot; said Jas.
&quot;I know. I say we fill up on drinks, and head back to the room,&quot; said Annie. &quot;In fact, I have an idea that includes all of us,&quot; she said slyly.
So drink they did. Each person had a large drink, followed by a small coffee. Jas topped it off with a beer. They headed back to the same room they had come from, to find it clean and empty. They removed their clothes, and sat on the large bed in the room. This is how they positioned themselves:
Jas lay down, with Annie&#039;s face in her pussy. Behind Annie, Jake entered her pussy…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Jamie was at her aunt&#039;s house, visiting her sick cousin. Nothing serious, just a bout with the flu, but her cousin was too tired and exhausted to get out of bed for anything, including to pee. So her aunt had bought her dear cousin Marie teenager–sized diapers, to make things easier on her. Her aunt needed to run some errands, so Jamie stayed to keep Marie company.
&quot;So, um, I&#039;m really sorry you&#039;re sick.&quot;
&quot;Yeah, me too, but it&#039;s not so bad being waited on hand and foot, and having your diaper changed like a baby.&quot;
&quot;Geez, I don&#039;t know about you, but I could never go back to diapers, having someone know when I&#039;ve peed or pooped, and having them change me.&quot;
&quot;Oh, but I enjoy it. Not to mention, between you and…</p>

        <p class="card-text">When we last left off with our lovers, they were on their way to the mall. But Annie had no idea what Jane had in store for them. Hell, even Jane had no idea what was soon to come. Sitting in Jane&#039;s car, Annie could barely contain her excitement. Jane was always the wild one, doing crazy things for attention. One time she set her lawn on fire, just to get her parents&#039; attention, so she could show them what she had learned in dance class that day. But Annie admired Jane, for she did what Annie could only hope to do, and Jane usually did it for her as well. As they pulled into the mall parking lot, Annie&#039;s stomach starting jumping and fluttering inside of her. Annie had never been to this part of town, although…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Madison was my best friend in my junior year of high school. We became close almost instantly, and we were almost never apart. We told each other everything, so it was only natural that she told me about how peeing made her come. I told her that I was the exact same way, and within a few months of meeting, we became lovers. We would always go to each other&#039;s houses, or drive somewhere secluded, and act out our most wild fantasies. One day, on the way to a most often deserted field, our most memorable experience occurred. We had started the day by drinking lots of coffee like we always did. Then we got into the car, she was driving, and turned on the radio. Usually, we managed to hold our pee without leaking…</p>

        <p class="card-text">As she watched her mom pull out of the driveway, Becca could hardly contain her excitement. She had waited all morning for this. She had started the day by drinking lots and lots of coffee, telling her mom that she needed to wake herself up to study for her finals. As she sat down at the computer now, she started to look at sites with pictures– pictures of girls wetting their panties, pictures of girls masturbating, and even pictures of girls humping each other. How she longed to do the same. Her clit began to tingle.
Her mom had told her to do the laundry. Now she had a wonderful idea. She made her way into the laundry room, and decided to do a load of jeans. She picked up the first pair, and put them on.…</p>

She had waited all week for this day, when her parents would be out for the day, about 8 hours. That gave her plenty of time to do what she wanted, and clean it all up too. She would lay in bed at night, softly stroking her young pussy, and think about the day that would come, when she could live out her most wild fantasies. Her friend Jane was on her way...
Jane was into peeing too. Both she and Annie were only 18, but they had known each other since they were 5. They went through the everyday accidents of accidentally peeing in their pants when they were little. If one wet her pants, the…</p>

She had also never slept at my house either. So when my parents said they would be out of town that weekend, but weren&#039;t planning on taking me with them, I was excited– it sounded like the perfect opportunity to have the sleepover with Sam that I had been waiting to have. Sam&#039;s parents were going to visit her older sister, who had just had a new baby, so they would be gone as well, which left us either house available for our sleepover. Sam decided that she wanted me to stay with her at her house instead of coming to mine– and for some reason she…</p>

All she could think about as she walked down the aisles was the huge amount of fun she would have with all of her girlfriends. Unfortunately, she had gotten so caught up in everything she was doing at home that she had forgotten to go to the grocery store until the very last minute.
&quot;I hope I can manage to get there before it closes&quot; –she thought to herself.
It was still open, but it was only 20 minutes from closing time. As she hurriedly made her way down the aisles, she was distracted by something going on in the back room. It sounded like an employee was getting fired, or at least yelled at a whole lot. So she hid behind a display…</p>
