        <p class="card-text">The fog was lifting from the skyline, the fir trees outlined against the hazy early–morning sky. The far window in the room was open, the fresh smell of pine needles and the pure mountain air wafting through the small room. The dormitory was eerily silent at this hour, the sun was just coming up and most of the dorm&#039;s inhabitants were still cozily in bed, sleeping. Elizabeth got up out of her bed, quietly stretched her limber arms to the ceiling, trying not to wake her roommate. She yawned and looking at the clock on her makeshift desk, pulled off her pink underwear and lavender nightshirt and stumbled sleepily into the shower. Her roommate lay in bed, still asleep while Elizabeth started her day. Towel…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Hi all,
It all started with me reading a lot of erotic stories about hypnosis on http://www.literotica.com.
I was intrigued by the idea of it, and turned on as well. I knew that it did not work like that, no–one does anything he or she normally would not do under hypnosis, but I decided to try to learn hypnosis never the less. I went to the library of a university and lent some of the books. I read trough them and learned nothing new. No luck there, so I wanted to get a few more. This time I did not go the general university library, but to the one of the physiology department. I looked around and found a very old book about hypnosis. It was so old, and written in such old language that no one hat lent it…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Susy and Carly had left the nightclub and were taking a short cut home through the new Retail Park. Blonde haired Susy hadn&#039;t been too keen to go this way. She considered it kind of creepy, deserted, and as it was midnight, she also thought it might be a pretty good place to get mugged, beaten up, or worse.
Red haired Carly, older (though not necessarily wiser) by five years, pooh–poohed the younger girl&#039;s fears, pointing out that the area was well lit; in fact probably better lit than the route they&#039;d have had to take through town.
So they ended up walking past the various collections of shops and stores. Carly was stopping at virtually every shop to look in the windows at what was on sale. Susy though, was…</p>

Twenty–five years ago, we lived in the same town and we were lovers and roommates at the time but it just wasn&#039;t right for a long–term relationship. We broke up and I never heard from her again. She was really wonderful; it was I who was the jerk.

Upon arriving at the party, we were both thirsty so we drank three bottles of beer apiece, along with five cups of lemonade. Michelle finally arrived and she drank another four bottles of beer. We were there for a total of two hours before we left to embark upon our camping trip. Everyone needed to use the restroom but it was so messy that we decided not to use it. Then we left.
Julie, our driver, told us it would take an hour to get to the camping spot as long as there wasn&#039;t a traffic problem. That sounded fine, we…</p>

Normally we finish at three o&#039;clock but that day we had to stay until four thirty in the afternoon.
It started off like any other day with our teacher, Ms. Jorgenson drinking her two cups of coffee. That day we had her the entire day as our teacher. After finishing her coffee, she started to teach, and then went outside for more coffee. She filled a thermos with three more cups of coffee and brought it back to class to drink while teaching.
At lunchtime, we were forced to eat inside due to rain, though some of us left in cars to go home or to…</p>

I finally worked up the courage to have a public wetting &quot;accident&quot;. I decided on a mall as the location.

        <p class="card-text">&quot;How would you like to make some easy money?&quot; Jo asked Jaynee as she got back from the ladies&#039; room at The Oak one night. They would do this about once a month. Leave their troubles behind and sing karaoke. It was good for the soul although neither could afford it as often as necessary. Jo had just brought back another round of drinks from the bar and was waiting for her friend to return.
&quot;Do tell!&quot; An excited response; this was good for Jo, because the question she was about to ask was a touchy one. It had taken 3 hard lemonades to get up the nerve to get even this far.
Jaynee and Jo had been friends all through their school days and shared their innermost secrets with each other. So when Stan, Jo&#039;s husband…</p>

        <p class="card-text">This story is one of my fantasies (based on some fact) but is not meant to be in any way disrespectful to the very real problem of bullying in schools.
Making my way to the ladies&#039; room I saw them, three girls standing in the hall, their uniforms the same as mine, but that&#039;s where the similarity ended. My name is Mary. I attended my local school, but even at 18 I was still being bullied– by Heather and her two cronies.
I had refused to give them any money or CDs and they wanted to push me. Heather called me over and I went timidly pulling my blazer over my dark blue pleated skirt (ballerina length) and white blouse.
Suddenly I had a thought. Anything is better than the insults and pain so I increased my leg…</p>

        <p class="card-text">When I went to high school, students respected their teachers a little more, and as a general rule did as they were told when the teachers were looking. Further more, we didn&#039;t have all of these long breaks between classes. We had exactly five minutes between classes to do our personal business whether that was getting to the next class, meeting with our friends briefly, going to our locker to change books, or using the bathroom. Well, I remember that our school was a large one, and my PE class was on one side of the school while my Science class was on the other side and upstairs! To make matters worse, sometimes teachers had the right to hold an entire class after the bell for two minutes if that class was…</p>

        <p class="card-text">I last left you with the story of my threesome with my neighbor Casey and her gorgeous friend Kendra. Casey and I had made a plan with the intention of making Kendra have an accident along with us. Our plan was almost successful, except that Kendra found a trashcan at the last second and used it as a toilet. I didn&#039;t even get to watch her unleash her flow, as she ran into another room. Nevertheless, Casey and I both had our intentional accidents and enjoyed a night long of sex with Kendra. It was amazing. (If you have no idea what I am talking about please read my previous story)
About three weeks passed when I got a call from Kendra. I totally didn&#039;t even expect to hear from her again, unless I ran into her…</p>
