        <p class="card-text">A few years ago when my wife and I were still living in the UK, we used to go to casinos fairly regularly. At one particular casino, which we used to go to quite often, there was a female croupier who was always very jovial and chatty, very different from the sour–faced type that many of them seem to be. Even though she (usually) still managed to take our money, it was always more fun when she was dealing, and all the regular customers knew her quite well, my wife and I included.
I&#039;ll call this croupier Sally for the purpose of telling you about the incident, she was about 20 years old, she did tell us her age once, but I can&#039;t remember. She was nicely slim and had long, slightly curly, blonde hair, and a…</p>

        <p class="card-text">A few years ago when I was living in London I traveled on the underground regularly (that&#039;s usually called &#039;the Tube&#039; in London, or the Subway or Metro for people outside the UK), and would often see girls who were obviously desperate for a pee.
Because there are no toilets on the Underground trains, and none on most of the stations, on many occasions I was lucky enough to witness girls getting so desperate that it resulted in a &#039;wetting&#039;, or a &#039;public peeing&#039; where the girl would just finally give up and squat down for a pee. However, this is the only &#039;Business Suit&#039; wetting that I can remember.
On this particular day I was traveling during the middle of the day and the trains were not very crowded, so…</p>

The story that I am about to tell you is from twelve years ago (give or take one) when I was working as a driver for a mini–cab company (private taxi) in North West London, near Kilburn.
Our customers were a wide range of people, many of them were regulars, and being Kilburn there were quite a lot of pubs and bars in the area, so a lot of our work in the evenings was taking customers to and from these various watering holes.
This particular evening started out just like many others, and about 7:30 I got a job over the radio to go to an address in Willesden Green which I knew very well because it was the home of one of our regular customers, an extremely attractive girl in her early twenties with long…</p>
