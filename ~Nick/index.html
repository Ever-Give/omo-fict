A third true story taken from tape recordings with my girlfriend Nathalie:
By the time I was 20 I was working as an estate agent with my Dad, that meant that he was doing most of the paperwork to start with while I showed people around houses. On my third day at work I had been out all morning with a family of four and we had visited half a dozen houses by 1.30pm, which was well into my lunchtime. They were staying in a hotel in the town and I dropped them off there before driving back to the office on the other side of town. I remember the trip well as by then I was really looking forward to having a pee. I hadn&#039;t been since before breakfast and had been given coffee by four of the vendors as…</p>

        <p class="card-text">If ever my boss asked me if I wanted to do a little overtime it usually meant working late in the workshop of the garage getting a car ready for delivery the next day. A rush job. This was fine but on one such occasion the job turned out to be much more enjoyable.
&#039;How would you like to run up to Heathrow this evening?&#039; he asked.
From Bristol this wasn&#039;t any big deal and I had nothing else planned so I said &#039;Yeah, sure&#039;.
He carried on, &#039;It&#039;s just that Fiona&#039;s flying in from Paris and I just have to be at a meeting until late, so she would have to get a train or coach or something and you know what she&#039;s like in those situations, she&#039;s likely to have a disaster of some sort.&#039;
I knew what she was like…</p>

More from Nathalie, as told to Nick:
Before I left school, and aged 18, I took a Saturday morning job at a small filling station in Bristol. Normally there was a staff of three; the boss, who was a small, balding man nearing retirement who was always looking up my skirt, and his wife and son. Between them they served petrol and did some small repair jobs in the adjoining workshop but on Saturdays mornings only the boss turned up as the son took his mother shopping. This was OK for the first few weeks although if it was busy I sometimes found it difficult to find time to go to the loo, which was at the back of the workshop, and anyway I tried to avoid using it because it was filthy and the door…</p>

        <p class="card-text">A true story (only slightly embellished) told by Nathalie, my girlfriend, using a tape recorder. She has found out how much I enjoy this sort of thing! She is now 27, 5ft 9ins and slim with golden red hair that she keeps very long. Nathalie tells:
I have always seemed to need to wee when it&#039;s not possible to find a loo, and anyway, I&#039;m too shy to say so if I&#039;m with someone. When I was in my teens, I used to be sent on holiday with my Aunt and Uncle and my cousin, Peter, a year older than me. We always went caravanning, usually to Cornwall, but once we went to the Lake District and Scotland. From Bristol this was a long way and meant hours in the car. Uncle Jim didn&#039;t like to have to stop except at lunchtime…</p>

        <p class="card-text">When I was 16, I had to get on a minibus to get to and from school, as I lived way out in the countryside in Cornwall. One of the girls in my year, Lisa also used the bus as she lived about a mile further on from me. One afternoon, when the last lesson was Physics, I had been watching Lisa from my place at the table behind hers; she was a very attactive girl with long auburn hair and looked very sexy in her uniform of white blouse and short grey skirt. What caught my attention first was that, to get a better view of a demonstation of something – I can&#039;t remember what – Lisa was kneeling on her chair and leaning forwards with her elbows on the table. This gave me a nice view of her purple knickers, which was…</p>
