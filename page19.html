        <p class="card-text">Alyssa, Elizabeth and Michelle were three sisters from the oldest to the youngest, who had been chatting and drinking at a bar. The beers went by and the conversation was so interesting that they hadn&#039;t remembered to go to the bathroom, but finally they realised that their bladders were dangerously full. The first to notice it was the middle one.
Elizabeth: &quot;Girls, I&#039;ll be back in a minute, I need to use the toilet.&quot;
Michelle: &quot;Wait, I&#039;ll go with you, I need it too.&quot;
Alyssa: &quot;Hey, don&#039;t leave me here alone, you aren&#039;t the only ones that have several beers inside!&quot;
Elizabeth: &quot;Ok, but I called it first, so one of you&#039;ll have to wait here to watch our stuff while the other one comes with me.&quot;

        <p class="card-text">Sarah sat on the toilet. She had finished her rather modest pee, but she was in no hurry. Like most evenings, she had nowhere to go. And she was busy thinking about something – something that had been preoccupying her more and more over the last few months.
Why couldn&#039;t she get a boyfriend? Lots of men asked her out, some asked a second time, but then they seemed to get bored. Nobody wanted a serious relationship with her. She was twenty–five and beginning to get anxious.
It wasn&#039;t her looks that were at fault. She was five foot nine high, with black hair, a good figure and very nice legs. She dressed smartly and took a lot of care with her clothes. And it wasn&#039;t the sex. When a relationship went that far,…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Lee lies still, awake enough to know she needs to pee, but not enough to actually do anything about it. She watches as her friend Donna stirs in her sleep, moans, and goes quiet again. She and Donna are new friends; they have not yet learned the intimacies of the other&#039;s mannerisms and habits. Donna&#039;s covers are kicked back and Lee can see Donna&#039;s hand resting between her legs, where dark curls peek from under the crotch of her white panties. Donna&#039;s hand moves, ever so slightly, and she arches her back, just a bit.
Another moan. Lee wonders if the hand has anything to do with the moan. It doesn&#039;t surprise the 23–year–old blond to realize she, and apparently her nipples, like the idea that it does. She had…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Kristan enjoyed skiing. She and Brad were on their way to the ski resort and she couldn&#039;t be happier. She wore her skin–tight jeans because she knew that they drove Brad crazy. This was their first date, so Kristan was incredibly nervous. And when she gets nervous, she has accidents. Nevertheless, when Brad offered her some coffee to warm up on the way to the slopes, she accepted. When they got to the resort, Kristan began to feel the urge to pee. Brad was eager to hit the slopes though after the long 2–hour drive, so she agreed to take a few runs before going to the lodge.
She put on her skis and teetered her way to the lift. Brad held her hand as they slowly slid their way onto the bench. The seat came in…</p>

I usually leave all my pee for when I get home.
But I wasn&#039;t always like that... back when I was in college my bladder wasn&#039;t all that strong and didn&#039;t have that much capacity. I guess I was just &#039;normal&#039; :) Anyway, one day I arrived late for a test, didn&#039;t pee first, got desperate, you get the picture (I&#039;ll tell it in some other story), and ended up failing the course because I had to leave the test early to pee so I didn&#039;t answer all the questions.

        <p class="card-text">Hi, my name is Anni van Beek, and I found this site quite by accident. I live in Seattle, but I am of Dutch origin, and I have moved here with my parents when I was 9. (That is why neither my Dutch nor my English is close to perfect...)
I would like to tell you how I got into what others would call &quot;strange habits,&quot; and actually, I can tell stories that would fill a book.
It all started when I met Carlene. We work in the same insurance company, two cubicles apart. We often had lunch break together (we still have) and became fairly open to each other.
Back to Carlene– she looks like what the boys would call cute, seeming a bit naive sometimes.
She had told me once that her parents had always been very…</p>

In fact, aside from the fact that we continued to sleep in the same bed, our relationship went back to what it had been in the past. I had arrived on Saturday evening and all the big revelations had taken place before midnight Sunday.
While it was uneventful in terms of any wetting together or other sex play, we did get around a bit. We went swimming in Lake Coeur d&#039;Alene, borrowed a friend&#039;s sailboat for a day, spent one whole day shopping and Carol tried to teach me how to play golf – sorry, but that&#039;s just not going to happen!

I dumped Melissa and boy did she ever get revenge. I was out at a bar with my new girlfriend Kristan one night drinking. As usual, Kristan was decked out in her skin–tight stretch jeans with black boots and tank top. Her ass was unbelievable in her light, skin–tight jeans. There we were drinking and having a good time when I spotted Melissa across the bar. Melissa was about ten years older than me and we had dated about a year. It used to be a real turn on for me that she was around 40 and I was 30. I used to love the way she would dress – everything skin–tight. Tonight was no different. She looked hot wearing a pair of…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Bright sun shone over the fields that mellow spring Saturday morning. Anne felt a quiet sense of satisfaction as she drove homewards. She&#039;d busily spent the morning helping her best friend Wendy host a coffee morning and had poured countless cups of coffee. The purpose of the coffee morning had been to raise funds for new loos for the community hall in Wendy&#039;s village. It had to be said that the old ones had become rather grotty and badly needed replacement. The sooner funds could be raised; the sooner work could begin on replacing them. Anne only ever remembered using them once – during the interval of a concert – and on that occasion she&#039;d needed to do more than pee. Had she only needed to pee she&#039;d have…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Hello, I&#039;m 38 and I&#039;m an Italian–American living on the west coast...but this story is not about myself. It&#039;s a story about a girlfriend that I had once... her name was Lindsay (that&#039;s not her real name of course) and we were both 19 back then. I won&#039;t waste time trying to describe her, but I tell you she was very pretty. Picture her as you will ;) We had been dating for almost two years so we were pretty comfortable talking about just about everything. One thing that I noticed was that she had a small bladder, like, she always had to go to the bathroom very often.
She was the kind of girl who would come out of a movie almost peeing her pants or would have to stand up and go pee in the middle of the movie. So…</p>

John Gallagher gave her a reproving glance as she rejoined him. &quot;Keep under cover before somebody sees you,&quot; he warned in a harsh whisper.
&quot;I can&#039;t help it,&quot; Allison snapped. &quot;I&#039;m dying for the loo.&quot;
&quot;Look,&quot; Gallagher said, &quot;If someone looks out of the back windows of that warehouse and sees you strutting up and down out here, the whole operation will be blown.&quot;
&quot;Alright, alright,&quot; Allison conceded. &quot;I just hope something happens soon, because I can&#039;t wait much longer.&quot;

        <p class="card-text">Holly sat on the low wall and tried to breathe slowly to calm down as she reviewed her situation. Three hours ago she&#039;d been shopping in town, in her short, tight red top that she still wore, and her cut off denim shorts, which had been stolen whilst she was being accused of shoplifting in a store, along with her handbag. Now she was just wearing a tight yellow bikini bottom to cover her most private parts. The large coke that she&#039;d drank over two hours ago was now stretching her bladder, and she was trying to walk home, not having money for a bus and not being allowed into a store to use the facilities in her bare feet and legs. It wasn&#039;t a bad outfit to walk round in during the summer – she liked to tease…</p>
