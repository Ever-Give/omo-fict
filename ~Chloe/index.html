Robin rocketed out of bed just as her alarm clock exploded with sound. Robin swore, checked the time and swore louder. She was late for soccer practice AGAIN and Coach Martin would not be so understanding this time. The game was to start in just 10 minutes and Robin knew that she&#039;d be very late. Tossing on a sports bra, Robin hurried to the bathroom to comb her hair and brush her teeth. She had to pee but figured she could do that in the locker room. Besides, she just didn&#039;t have the time.
Pulling her strawberry–blonde hair back in a quick ponytail, Robin glanced at the clock again. It was 5 minutes to 10, meaning she had just 5 minutes to get to the…</p>
