        <p class="card-text">Loretta and I had just attended a piano concert and we were waiting in the attended parking garage for an attendant to bring my car forward. Neither of us had been able to go to the bathroom for several hours and both of us had imbibed a few beers just before the concert. Now we were standing on the platform waiting for my car while there were many other patrons doing the same. While I was somewhat uncomfortable with the stress on my bladder, I couldn&#039;t help but notice that Loretta was getting desperate for a pee.
She shifted her weight from one foot to the other and occasionally walked around in a small circle. She was wearing an off–white suit with a straight skirt and powder blue blouse. She didn&#039;t mention…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Vickie was beginning to feel a bit uncomfortable as she placed the deviled eggs onto the picnic table at her family reunion. Her bladder was rapidly filling but she had already decided that she would ignore it. She was the teenager designated to help the grown–ups organize the tables and offerings and she was determined to complete her tasks. She was, as all the other young ladies before her at these reunions, honored to take part in setting the table. And, she was determined that nothing would interfere with her enjoyment of these proceedings.
But now, she was instructed to place a dab of soft cheese on a thousand or so, she thought, small crackers and arrange them in a fashionable manner on the table. While…</p>

        <p class="card-text">The favorite teen hangout that summer (1957) was a 10–acre pond that had been enhanced with a sandy beach and a platform with an Olympic style diving board. There were rowboats for rent and there was a concession stand. Even though the lake was far away from her home Pat spent many of her spare hours there in the summer of her eighteenth year (1957).
Pat was by now an accomplished musician having mastered the guitar and she carried her guitar everywhere she went. She didn&#039;t swim that much so her main reason for visiting the lake was to be with her friends and entertain them with her guitar playing. She usually didn&#039;t wear a swimsuit to the lake, as she didn&#039;t plan to swim. Trips to the lake for Pat required…</p>

        <p class="card-text">It was in the fall of 1967 when Nancy found herself in the clutches of the State Police. She was demonstrating on the campus of her college when the demonstration turned violent. She wasn&#039;t aware of this fact and she continued to demonstrate just as she had been prepared to do by the leaders of the demonstration. She was still shouting what a great sham the college administration and the government of the United States was when the state police hustled her and several of her friends into a line where she and her friends would appear in front of a pair of officers who would determine whether Nancy and her friends would be detained or not.
Gathered into this queue, Nancy began to feel a bit uncomfortable. She…</p>

They had gobbled up six or seven beers by early afternoon and a couple of bowls of chips and popcorn. After the first six beers they had both relieved themselves and were quite aware of further requirements for relieving themselves. 
Before the next requirement came to their attention, Bruce suggested that they retire to his garden apartment to grill some steaks on the balcony. Nancy thought it was a great idea and stood up to prepare to leave. Both Bruce and Nancy had a slightly full bladder but both thought that they were in control. As…</p>

Bruce enjoyed a few beers at his favorite bar. As a matter of fact he enjoyed too many beers. When he left to pick Nancy up he had already violated the rule of six. The rule of six means that when you have had six beers you will probably need to pee. And, when you answer that need all subsequent needs become very urgent needs. In short, while the first pee when beer drinking can be put off for a long time the next and all subsequent calls to pee are urgent. Once one has acknowledged the…</p>

However, such incidents have necessarily had to be incidents of pure accident in order to arouse me. I have never thought I would be aroused by purposeful wetting accidents on the part of females. But then, I never considered it possible that a female would wet herself on purpose.
Male wettings whether accidental or not has never entered my mind as a means of sexual arousal, only as a matter of curiosity.

In 1962 I was in a position as a peon who manned the coffee bar at my squadron operations facility. In this role I was privy to many pilots&#039; conversations.
There was one conversation that was particularly interesting, as you will see. My squadron was one of fighter interceptor aircraft in the New York/Washington D. C. air defense sectors. These fighter interceptors were two–seater, two engine aircraft capable of mach one speeds with a cruising range of 1500 miles. However, for the purposes of this story they normally cruised at less than mach one for less than 1500 miles.…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Nancy was well aware of the beer drinker&#039;s rule of thumb; during the first six beers you will most likely forgo taking a trip to the rest room. But, when you finally do succumb to an aching bladder after the first six you will find that you have to answer the call immediately and that the call will occur often. More accidents occur after the first six beers in a beer drinking session than at any other time. Nancy had numerous experiences with beer drinking sessions but she had never had an accident until... Nancy was in a neighborhood tavern drinking with her new boyfriend and she noticed that she had just finished her sixth beer. She excused herself and went to the restroom to relieve herself in a normal…</p>

        <p class="card-text">From the time Nancy was nine years old she had accompanied her father on fishing trips.
In fact the whole family occasionally went along and they picnicked. Nancy&#039;s father was an avid fly fisherman and since Nancy was like all young daughters she wanted to engage in her fathers favorite pastime. When she was thirteen she was an accomplished fly fisherman. By the time she reached fourteen, her parents had divorced. Nancy was sent to live with her mother. She was devastated; she loved being with her Dad. After that, she was only able to see him sporadically, due to school and his work schedule. 
One Friday evening after Nancy had reached the age of eighteen her father called and asked if she wanted to go trout…</p>

        <p class="card-text">The visiting team had won and now they were boarding the bus for the two–hour trip home. Also the cheer leading team and other fans that had gotten permission to ride the school bus to the game were boarding for the return trip home. The fact that their team had won sort of threw the schedule and pre–boarding activities out of kilter. Nancy danced and pranced around the boarding area congratulating each of the team members as they boarded their special bus. She ignored the fact that her dancing and prancing concealed a need to void her bladder.
