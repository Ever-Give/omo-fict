        <p class="card-text">By the time I&#039;d turned 20, I had experimented a little with being desperate to pee but hadn&#039;t really experienced any significant incidents because I was too shy to test it out.
I was single at the time and hadn&#039;t seen much action for a while and was feeling the frustration a little. I decided I would go out with the girls for a night at a few bars and see what happened, at this point not even thinking about my desperation fascination. We went for a few drinks at a friend?s house before getting the tube into London, and I made sure I peed before we left, more out of small bladder habit than any strong urge to go.
Alcohol for some reason works quicker on my bladder than the rest of me so by the time we got off…</p>

        <p class="card-text">I have been reading this site for a while now, and to be completely honest, it both reassures me and turns me on that other people get into these situations too! I&#039;ve been having these sorts of problems (and accidents) for as long as I can remember, and my friends and family just don&#039;t seem to get it. I guess I have a small bladder (much smaller than anyone else), and so need to pee a lot.
As I&#039;ve been reading and reading these stories, thought it was about time to give something back. I&#039;m no writer though, so instead of writing long, in–depth stories, I&#039;ve put together a few of my different memories. Trust me, there&#039;s too many to count!
