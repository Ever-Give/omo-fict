        <p class="card-text">It was 4:10. Jessica knew that she couldn&#039;t be late coming home today. She was already grounded for sneaking her boyfriend into her room the night before, and if she was late today her mother would surely add more time to her punishment. She hustled to make the 4:15 bus even though she was a 10–minute walk from the bus stop. She walked taking very quick steps, hoping that she would make it just as the bus pulled up. Time seemed to pass faster, and she didn&#039;t seem to be reaching her destination quickly enough. She started to run for the bus stop through the cold air. The first day of fall and it was 55 degrees. Far too cold for the thin jacket and stretch jeans she had chosen to wear. As she made it to the bus…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Kameron woke up at 7:45 am on the dot. &quot;Oh shit!!!&quot; She screamed as she jumped out of bed. This was the day that Kameron was supposed to catch the 9:30 flight to Orlando, Florida. The previous night, she partied hard with some friends, so she hadn&#039;t even packed yet.&quot;Calm down, Kameron!&quot; she mumbled to herself as she searched for her, &quot;Travel Checklist.&quot; It was a default checklist that she always made out whenever she was traveling. It had all of the basic things that she would need to bring along on the trip. Kameron spotted the checklist hanging up on her refrigerator. She opened the fridge and took out her 32–ounce bottle of Aquafina, as she eyed the checklist quickly. She drank a huge gulp and then began to…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Jennifer sat in her room, flicking through the channels on her 50–inch television. This was a very warm spring day, so she was reclined in her lazy–boy, quickly sipping lemonade from the large mug in front of her. Her air conditioner was broken, so naturally the lemonade was her means of cooling off. After about an hour, Jennifer had drank the entire pitcher of lemonade. She was finally cool, but she still couldn&#039;t find anything to watch on TV.
The breeze was beginning to pick up, so Jennifer decided not to make another pitcher of lemonade. In fact, she had decided that she would use her new charge card at the mall. She put the pitcher back into the kitchen, and was about to go to her room to change into…</p>
