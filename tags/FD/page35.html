        <p class="card-text">Where Robert lives they have an agricultural show each year. There are pens of animals, rabbits in cages, plates of vegetables and flowers, tables of jam, a beer tent, lots of little girls and their ponies– all set around a marquee where they award the prizes. We only went for a quick look round after our midday snack hoping to be back for an afternoon in the garden.
The field where the cars are parked being some distance from the show site we had to join a crowd picking its way through the heaps of dung left by the cattle. I spent ages along the row of cages with pets. Again there was a lot of dung. Moving on to the ponies I had my third encounter with this dung, which the country people seem quite happy…</p>

She&#039;s been driving for hours, and she&#039;s bouncing up and down in the seat, she has to pee so bad. She&#039;s wearing a light summery blouse (with a bra, alas, but that may change) and cut–offs that are very short, her thighs are bare all the way to the tops, the skin warm where the sun hits her lap. The cut–offs are tight against her crotch, which is a good thing, but also a little tight across her bladder, which is a problem. Maybe she&#039;s undone just that button at the very top, but she doesn&#039;t dare unzip.
The last place she could have stopped…</p>

Naomi was running late. She was due to appear on the Tonight Show in half an hour and she was about halfway through her second grande cup of Starbuck&#039;s coffee. She loved Starbuck&#039;s coffee and today in particular, she needed her two large cups after a long and tiring day. But the fact that it was piping hot made it difficult for her to gulp it down. It was definitely worth the effort so she went ahead and drank.
The studio was at the other end of town and she had to leave in five minutes. She was a conscientious driver and didn&#039;t like to drive with a cup in her hand. So she finished her coffee as fast as she could and left the caf&#039;. It had been raining with the result that the temperature had…</p>

Her London friends had been right; Lemonade was definitely Manchester&#039;s hottest lesbian nightclub. Quality tunes pulsed from the decks and quality girls filled every corner. Serious female talent stretched from the strobing dance floor to the secluded alcoves where several sets of faces were already pressed together.
A girl, that was what Stella needed now. There was definitely enough to choose from. Some possibilities had already caught her gaze– maybe the strawberry blonde at the bar, or the little Chinese girl. Yes, the little Chinese girl in the even smaller tight white dress had definitely…</p>

        <p class="card-text">She could make me do anything.
I first saw her at an early–morning swim. We were the first to arrive, before the hall filled up. She was swimming with slow, easy strokes, doing flip–turns and sliding under water, long hair streaming. She was wearing a red, high–cut swimsuit, emphasizing her slender, well–trained body. I went in, doing the best I could, but found her passing me again and again. I had to admire the elegant way she moved in the water.
Suddenly she was gone. I decided it was time to return to the dressing room.
We were still alone. She stood under the shower, back to me, washing her hair. She looked to be in her early forties, but very fit for her age, with slim waist, tight buttocks and just a…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Gina Marstin sat at her computer with her hand between her legs trying to prolong the inevitable... a trip to the bathroom to relieve her torturously full and visibly swollen bladder. It wasn&#039;t that this would provide any help in keeping her silky white nylon panties dry; they had hosted her deliciously wet pussy for quite some time before her desperation (and her fingers) had entered the picture. As she contemplated her trip to the bathroom she thought how she, always so prim and proper, had arrived at this point.
She and her husband were opposites in everything they did. She was an early riser and he liked to sleep in. Since their bedroom time was so different, they discovered early in their 12–year…</p>

She had not accounted for the extra pressure on her bladder from the huge soft drink her employee had ordered for each of them at lunch. It had fallen in well with her plan so she had said nothing. Now she was beginning to wonder about her timing, to say nothing of her bladder capacity. Reminding herself of her goal, she gave herself a quick caress between her legs, then another because it felt sooo good the first time. Art would not know what hit him!

I was a desperately horny 18– year– old virgin guy, a Private in the Military, posted at an out of the way air base. The ratio of men to women on the base was about 15 to 1. There was a small town nearby, but to attract a girl there one had to surpass both competition from the military men and all the local competition. Us &#039;Pigeons&#039; as the local town boys called us– were highly resented for hitting on the local girls. I&#039;m not saying it was impossible to date a woman, but although I wasn&#039;t ugly, I did have an acne problem at that age. This certainly didn&#039;t help when the competition was so fierce, and I was also shy knowing that I wasn&#039;t as attractive as some of the…</p>

I am on an express bus sitting in a rear seat, going out to the suburbs to visit a relative for the weekend. The bus stops at one of the last downtown pickup points and then becomes an express bus with no more stops.
A beautiful, petite, slim, very sexy young woman climbs aboard. Her spectacular green eyes, set in a finely chiseled, sharp but not harshly contoured aquiline face, contrast marvelously with her stunning red hair. She is wearing a not quite see through green blouse that sets off her eyes and hints at a sexy, lacy bra cradling petite but perky eagerly up–thrusting breasts. A tight red miniskirt shows off perfectly sculpted lean legs, tapering nicely into matching…</p>

She rushed out of bed at around 7:45am, got washed and changed into a navy blue business top and knee–length skirt with a white blouse and black shoes. She felt a slight twinge in her bladder, but ignored it because she felt she would use the toilet when she got to work.
However, when she got to her local station, she had to wait twenty minutes for the train. By this time, she felt the need to go even more and started slight fidgeting on the spot. She looked for a toilet at the station and found one, but when she walked to the toilet door, she couldn&#039;t open it– the sign on the front said &quot;Out of Order&quot;.

        <p class="card-text">I guess that most of us with small bladders try to keep that fact hidden, or at least not advertise it more than we have to. Of course, I know that it is part of my nature, nothing to be ashamed of any more than mousy hair, small boobs or uneven teeth, but there isn&#039;t, as far as I know, a urinary equivalent of hair coloring, silicone implants, or cosmetic dentistry. (A bladder extension? Yes please! Would my health insurance cover that?) Maybe I am ultra–sensitive to this because I work in the marketing division of a competitive, male dominated, company, where I have to be better just to hold my own, so anything that might distract from perfection, such as popping to the loo too often, has to be avoided.…</p>

        <p class="card-text">I continue my theme of female desperation with a middle aged, well to do, well–dressed woman caught short in at least a semi public situation. I continually tire of stories about younger women that are provocatively dressed.
What a nightmare. Joan was sitting in her car and the traffic was backed up for miles; there seemed to be no way off the rural road she was stuck on, a combination of rain and sleet was pouring down, but worst off all... she had to go to the bathroom! Badly!!!
She had been to a dinner party with other people from her office where she had imbibed lots of wine and coffee. While she dutifully used the ladies&#039; room before she left, most of the liquid she had consumed hadn&#039;t reached her…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Gina, Carol and Fiona were 24 year old triplets, and pretty much identical. The only really obvious difference between them was their hair. Gina wore her natural blonde locks flowing down to the middle of her back. Carol had dyed her hair black and wore it to the shoulders with a severe fringe halfway up her forehead. Fiona had kept her hair blonde but had it cropped close to the scalp.
The girls were sitting in the garden of a man whose money they loved. Uncle Joe, as he liked to be known to them, was celebrating his 65th birthday and he&#039;d invited only three guests – the triplets. He&#039;d known the girls most of their lives as he&#039;d been their fathers business partner. When the girls were 17 their parents were…</p>

        <p class="card-text">I&#039;m 26, 5foot 5, 9stone nearly (120 pounds) and my boy friend is twice my age nearly. Both of us like watersports and we play almost every weekend. It was a Saturday in August 2000; we were on Robert&#039;s boat under the shade of an avenue of trees. The afternoon sun shone on a notice board saying &#039;Beware– Army shooting range&#039; so we stayed on board idly watching the ducks. My summer dress is the shortest a tubby girl can wear without looking silly. It&#039;s a pale blue with a belted waist and very full in the skirt covering my faded pink knickers by about three inches if I stand up straight.
When it&#039;s hot I prefer to do without a bra but I stick out a bit so I only pluck up the courage when we&#039;re far from…</p>
