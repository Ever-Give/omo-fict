        <p class="card-text">Jenny, as the only women driver who worked for the coach company, always liked to arrive early, both to avoid any criticism in a male dominated job, and to give herself time to get ready before taking her coach out. Hence she wasn&#039;t happy when the yard manager was waiting as she arrived.
&quot;Change of plan, I&#039;m afraid, Jenny,&quot; he greeted her. &quot;Bill has gone sick, so you&#039;ll have to do his job, it&#039;s urgent, there&#039;s nobody else here yet. The coach is outside ready, fuelled and everything, instructions on the wheel. Better get moving– you haven&#039;t got much time.&quot;
He pointed to a coach parked opposite and turned away with a parting &quot;Good girl, you&#039;ve saved my life!&quot; before Jenny had a chance to say anything. She…</p>

        <p class="card-text">When I finally completed my divorce and moved to Michigan, I was so happy to be away from ex in Florida and near my sister. After a month of being a single parent of three relocated teenagers, my sister and her husband invited me for a much–needed day on their powerboat.
It was a hot day so I drank a lot of water on the way. Because of the stress I had been under, they had lots of drinks prepared– a cooler full of beer, margaritas and bloody marys ready to go. I am not an alcoholic by any means, but I do love my happy hour.
The first hour was great, going up and down Lake Michigan. It got much cooler out on the lake but the more I drank the less it bothered me. It was really fun, until... It started as…</p>

She had a 45–minute drive ahead of her and she had no idea if she would ever reach the place in time. She hoped that she would. At the same time, she was very apprehensive. This was her first major show, and she was one of the girls who was selected, groomed and trained for the big show. She was part of a 30–member model team who were supposed to make their presence felt.
Stacy had just turned 18 a month ago. She felt like a woman when she thought about her age, but at the same time, her body betrayed her falsely. Stacy was a brunette, stood…</p>

        <p class="card-text">After what had seemed like an interminable Friday of classes at the NYU Downtown Campus, Katie McDonald, a 21–year–old graduate student in political economics, neatly arranged her books and materials in her tote pack and strode confidently out toward Washington Square. During the walk, she exchanged pleasantries with her classmates Rita Kudner and Boyd Hamilton, though declined an invitation to a student sleepover at someone&#039;s parents&#039; house on the Upper East Side. Katie had other things in mind.
Nearing the park, Katie managed to disengage from Rita and Boyd, who were heading for the subway. She strode over to a bench on the west side of the park, straightened her medium–length navy blue skirt and India…</p>

        <p class="card-text">The most daring I have ever been was in July of this year. It was a Sunday afternoon, chilly but crisp and clear. I was sitting on the balcony of my apartment, drinking beer with my new flat mate, Anna. We were chatting away comfortably when she mentioned the time she had wet herself after a university pub–crawl. I was instantly aroused, and tipsy enough to press her for more details. Anna was very obliging, in no way guessing that she had inadvertently stepped right into the territory of my secret passion. Then she turned it round, and asked me when I last had an accident. I couldn&#039;t tiptoe round the issue, for the beer had made me alarmingly honest. I felt myself go bright red, and Anna, realizing straight…</p>

        <p class="card-text">This is another little vignette that takes place in ca 1930 at the vast, pastoral estate in England known as Bish Manor.
We begin with Derrick, a tall, thin, respectable no–nonsense type. He was a handsome gentleman, and was avidly involved in the social circles, attended all the parties, and kept himself at all times blithe and charming. After all, one never knew where one&#039;s future fianc&#039;e might be lurking, and marrying well was an object most sought after by his crowd.
He thereby began his day, an outing to Bish Manor, with a bright and innocent temperament. There was nothing more on his mind but than to get nicely sloshed, play a little cricket outdoors with the fellows, have a good cigar and do a spot of…</p>

Pulling down on her short black mini–dress, she crossed her legs and put her purse in her lap. Linda glanced at her. Gillian smiled and rocked a little. –Got to go, she said.
— Me too, Linda admitted, sitting on the edge of the seat with arched back. Her low–cut jeans revealed red thong panties where her tight sweater didn&#039;t reach.
Gillian rose, hoping standing up would ease the pressure. It didn&#039;t. She rocked on her feet and rubbed her belly. –I really have to go, she said.
Linda just bit her lip and squeezed her knees together.

Probably some time in early childhood, when she discovered that putting off going to the little girls&#039; room caused a mix between pain and pleasure that made her tingle all over. Like everybody else she peed in the sea when she had to, but eventually she always was careful to avoid the toilet before going to the beach. From just letting go under water, she began releasing her urine as she waded in, feeling the warm wetness in her bathing suit seconds before the water reached her crotch. Lingering in the shower after exercises at school, she let it run down her legs when nobody could see her. Soaking in the tub at home, she spread her legs as the water drained,…</p>

I was at work, and it was a very long day. We don&#039;t get a lunch hour or tea breaks, not as you would understand them. We get two fifteen–minute breaks over the course of six hours.

        <p class="card-text">After taking some prescription medicine and then taking it easy for her recently unreliable bladder Patty decided to take a Saturday and go to the mall for some shopping. It was getting close to the holidays and she also really wanted to get out of the house. Her bladder had been fine the past week. Only once when she was out showing homes did she have to make any sort of effort to hold a full bladder.
She was dressed nice but casually by her standards. A plain white sweater and tan corduroys. The mall of course was very crowded and it took much longer to get her shopping done than she expected. She purchased a lot of gifts and by the time she was on line for her last purchase she really needed to pee. It had…</p>

        <p class="card-text">CHAPTER VIII: PISS AND VINEGAR
The remainder of that evening was, all at once, the quickest evening the Bird Women had yet spent in the Maxiversity and the slowest. After five months of misery with no hope for rescue, they finally had their first real chance; it&#039;s strange how much time seems to slow down as one comes to anticipate a wonderful event. As the Bird Women went through the nightly routine – being blindfolded in the locker room so that they couldn&#039;t see their fellow prisoners, having the blindfolds removed as they were herded into the bathroom stalls so that they could see the Swineherds watching them relieve themselves, having the blindfolds restored as they were sent to an edible but bland dinner…</p>

        <p class="card-text">My neighbor Darlene has always been one of the best neighbors one could hope for. I had known Darlene for years as a secretary in the Honors Program at the University, and had been quite surprised to discover when she moved in next door to me.
Back then Darlene had been the proud possessor of a body to die for. She had been blessed by nature with perhaps the most beautiful and bountiful breasts I had ever seen on a small (about 5&#039;3&quot;) slender woman. It was always a pleasure to observe her large nipples stand up and salute through whatever blouse she was wearing during our conversations over the low wall separating our houses.
Sadly, this sweet and supportive young woman made many mistakes in her choice of men…</p>

        <p class="card-text">I have an algebra test today, but I didn&#039;t study. This morning I woke up by the ringing of the alarm clock, but just knew I wasn&#039;t going to school. I am a senior, and failing this test could be the end of my academic career. I thought of a way out; I would pretend to be sick. I didn&#039;t do this often because I was a good girl... overall. I rarely needed to make excuses, but today was the exception.
The alarm rang for about three minutes before mom came in. She shook me, and asked me if I was awake. I was, of course, but I pretended not to be. After a few seconds, I rose suddenly, and sat up. I told mom of my upset stomach, and my throbbing head. She had no reason to doubt me since I almost never missed school.…</p>
