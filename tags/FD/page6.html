        <p class="card-text">Suzy stared out the airplane window, fascinated by the slow transformation of rural landscape into sprawling suburbia. Soon, she would be home from her business trip to the opposite side of the country. Slowly, as her attention shifted back to the inside of the plane, she became aware that she had been jiggling her leg, subconsciously fighting back the urge to go to the bathroom.
To her left was her co–worker Jenna, who had also come along on the trip. Currently, she was asleep, her ample breasts rising and falling slowly in time with her breath. Her sleeping face, hidden slightly beneath her blond hair, was a soft mask of innocence, with a softer, rounder structure than Suzy&#039;s own sharper–edged but still…</p>

She was a girl with long, brown hair, blue eyes, peach skin, and a beautiful, curvy body. As well as a little fetish that she shared with her men.
Lying and squirming on a sturdy mattress, the girl trembled as the spasms of pee pushed her bladder to near bursting point. Keeping her long legs wide open for her partner, she bit down on her lip as the fight to contain her pee became more and more difficult. She had her hands tied down, but she was not planning to use them of her own accord either way. Her legs were not tied, but she chose to spread them for her lover.
Her lover was a muscular man with a rugged face, short,…</p>

        <p class="card-text">My partner and I have written about a few things that we have done. He writes as JanaVal and he also helps me with my English, which allows me to say exactly what I mean when I write.
Although I would consider myself adventurous, wetting myself was not really something that interested me particularly before I met Jana. However, our first episode, which is listed in the stories as &#039;Splash Back&#039;, made me aware of how much Jana enjoyed this.
It is quite good fun I guess, in a rebellious way; and doing it always makes Jana more interested in me. I don&#039;t have a problem playing his games and it is just another, different kind of intimacy we share. I have done it when I have been on my own too, so that I get caught…</p>

        <p class="card-text">This is an absolutely true account of my experiences.
Where to start? I guess the best place to start would be second grade. That was the first time that I realized there was something I loved about seeing a girl desperate for a pee, or wetting herself. I was sitting in class one day, and a girl sitting a couple seats down from me asked permission to go to the bathroom. The teacher said okay, and the girl headed out the door. She came back after only a minute or so and sat down. Not five minutes later, we all heard a splashing sound. The girl was peeing herself! When the teacher asked her why, she said that she had been unable to undo her overalls by herself. I had the most amazing thrill, not only from…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Things have taken an unlikely turn at my workplace. I feel very fortunate to have met Tanja, but sometimes wish that it had happened outside the workplace. I doubt I would have been as fortunate with her at a bar or a club. It was something that was destined to happen exactly the way it did. Tanja and I hadn&#039;t even gone out together outside of work or even talked on the phone. I didn&#039;t know anything about her life outside of what I had seen at work. I didn&#039;t know if she had a boyfriend or even girlfriends other than Selena. I wanted to know more about Tanja and considered asking her about her life, but was afraid to come across as interrogating. Tanja was a free–spirited woman, willing to take life by the…</p>

Marge and George were decorating their bedroom. The old wallpaper had been stripped off, the paintwork rubbed down, and they had been to purchase the new paint and paper. When they returned, and pulled onto the driveway, Marge went to unlock the front door while George got the goods out of the car. As he stood up he was surprised to see a young lady in obvious great discomfort approaching him. She only took small steps and yet was hurrying, clutching her abdomen.

I&#039;m Katy, I live in Cornwall, I&#039;m about five and a half feet tall with shoulder length dark hair, and people often say I look a bit like Posh Spice.
I turned 19 a couple of weeks ago and as an extra special treat for my birthday my mum took me to New York on a shopping spree (I&#039;m so spoilt!!)
On the morning of the trip I had a couple of coffees and a bowl of cornflakes with lots of milk –yum!

My new job has kept me very busy to say the least. I begin work at 9:00 am each morning and quit at 5:00 pm. There is usually a few hours of work left over that I complete at home for clients coming in the next morning. Despite the big workload, I am enjoying my job. A big reason for this is the money. It is nice to be able to eat real meals after living on Kraft Dinner for the past six years. I am even considering moving out of my rented apartment and buying a place within the next year, a big step for someone just a few months out of university.
Without a doubt, the best part of my job is Tanja. I fell in love…</p>

Late one evening he was looking out of his window and he saw a couple of young ladies coming out of the park.

Driving towards home she remembers that she needs to stop by Walmart to pick up a few things, all the while sipping on a large 2–liter bottle of water.

        <p class="card-text">&quot;Sposa bagnata, sposa fortunata&quot; is a proverb from my native Italy. It means a wet wedding is lucky. Italy enjoys a fairly dry Mediterranean climate and rain is seen as a sign of fertility. I was happy to make my friend&#039;s wedding lucky.
Earlier this year a very good friend of mine, Anya, asked me to be a bridesmaid at her wedding. I was delighted to say yes and very pleased with the dresses she chose. I think this is quite difficult for an English wedding but she has exquisite taste having been in the fashion industry herself. The dress she wanted for me was a faded pink satin, beautifully made and very unfussy. It was very well cut and full enough to benefit from a hooped petticoat underneath.
The dress…</p>

        <p class="card-text">I&#039;m a 31–year–old slim blonde math teacher at this local high school. I remember a really memorable experience I had a while back. When the classes were done for the entire year, the students had to take a math exam this one particular day, and after 3 hours every student had finished the test and left the school. By that point, I had to pee kinda badly. 
During the test, I think I had drunk at least a litre and a half of water, and I didn&#039;t get a chance to use the washroom that morning either because I overslept. Plus, I had drunk around 2 large cups of coffee that morning as well. But I decided to hold it in because I had a lot of exams to grade and such. Even though I could&#039;ve taken the exams with me and…</p>

        <p class="card-text">So there I was, my jeans drenched and tears flooding down my face – it was like being submerged under water. It was a well–lit street, and though nobody actually stared, people could easily see that I was standing in a puddle of my own urine. I had never felt so humiliated and so totally isolated in my whole life. Then Paul put his arm round me and said: &quot;Come on, Peach love, let&#039;s get you home.&quot; It was so wonderful to feel that he wasn&#039;t disgusted with me that I just cried all the more. Paul wisely recognised that there was nothing he could say that would make things any better, just shepherded me silently back to his flat.
When we got there, he led me straight into the bathroom. I pulled off all my clothes…</p>

Not all of you will also know that the complete ring around London, over 120 miles (200 Km.) has only 2 service areas, so, as you might imagine, I do not travel on that road unless there is no alternative. 
Unfortunately there often is &#039;no alternative&#039; if you want to get to somewhere the other side of London, as I sometimes do when visiting my &#039;best friend&#039; from my schooldays, Mary, who has married and moved to the other side of London.

She was sweet looking on the outside with her curly light brown hair and her cute little smile. She also was a bit sexy looking, her chest a little bit above average and with a nice bottom.
