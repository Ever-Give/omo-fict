        <p class="card-text">My name is Patience and my twin sister is called Prudence. They&#039;re rather old–fashioned names; they came from a 1950s singing duo that my grandmother was very fond of. Usually we abbreviate them to &quot;Prue&quot; and &quot;Paish&quot;. But in one very important aspect of our lives – our toilet habits – they turned out to be prophetic.
Prudence and I look very similar – tall, dark hair, nice figures and legs, and we tend to have similar attitudes and interests. We even go for the same type of boyfriends. But on the all–important question of emptying our bladders, we are very different.
We live with our Mum in North London. And since she gets a bit of criticism in this story, let me just say she has been a wonderful Mum. Dad…</p>

        <p class="card-text">The day after I&#039;d witnessed Katherine wet herself after waiting for hours to get to a loo, I wasn&#039;t at all sure how she would react. She had been humiliated by being forced to pee in her clothes in front of me, an accident I was responsible for, albeit indirectly. Now that she&#039;d had time to think things over, I felt sure she would decide to tender her resignation and move on, rather than having to face the awkwardness of working alongside me.
It had been good while it lasted, I told myself. She had asked for a shot at the job, despite the difficulties created by the lack of female facilities, but things had gone hopelessly wrong on her very first day. I didn&#039;t see how she could deal with the embarrassment.…</p>

        <p class="card-text">This story is fictional.
Carlee really enjoys her new job as a meter reader for the public works department. She had always been an outdoors type, but not like the earthy women one usually associates with this stereotype. Carlee was 23–years–old, fresh out of university and working towards a career in municipal government. She thought that starting out with a first job as a meter reader would enable her to get real–world experience in local government as well as helping her keep fit. At the same time, she also thought that this job would allow her to indulge in her fetish of desperation and panty wetting, without anyone knowing.
Carlee is about 5&#039;6&quot; tall, with medium–length auburn hair and a great smile. Her…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Just before I was served a nice southern breakfast in a southeast Virginia town I saw something of interest that captured my interest for the next several minutes. It was about an hour and a half after sunup and a bus from the nearest town had just dropped off a passenger that was one of the most beautiful African–American girls I had ever seen. She was standing in the large driveway that served the restaurant where I had the occasion to dine that morning so I got a close up view of her.
And, from her intense watching of the road that crossed the main thoroughfare I assumed that she was waiting for a ride, probably to her home. She had probably worked the midnight shift at one of the mills in town and had…</p>

That mysterious age when we were suddenly considered to be &#039;big girls&#039; and that somehow we had been gifted with bladder control and capacity that many adults (including me!) could only envy. When I was taken to the Doctor with my &#039;bladder problem,&#039; I had been told it would &#039;get better as I grew up&#039; so I always looked forward to the time when I was &#039;grown up&#039; and by some mysterious way would no longer suffer from sudden, frequent, and urgent needs for a loo.

I fell in love with this girl a couple years ago when we were seniors in high school. We had flirted around for a couple of months when a mutual friend finally hooked us up. I couldn&#039;t believe my luck that this slender, athletic blonde country girl wanted to hook up with me.

        <p class="card-text">It was a Friday– the 23rd of June, to be precise. It was a date that Jennifer would never forget. It was on that date, when aged only 19, that one of those life–changing events occurred that you never forget.
It had started out like any other ordinary day. She was sat in a classroom in college and the afternoon was dragging. It wasn&#039;t the lesson, that was interesting enough, but she had plans for that night and was eager to get home. It was strange how time always seemed to slow down on those occasions when you actually want it to speed up! Jennifer was, by anyone&#039;s view, a &#039;stunner&#039;; shoulder length brunette hair that never looked wrong however she wore it, cute pert 34b breasts and legs that went all the…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Let me first explain why I&#039;m writing these stories. I&#039;ve got kind of a dilemma. I really enjoy desperation stories, but whenever I encounter such situations in real life, I&#039;m far too much of a nice guy to try and prolong a girl&#039;s need. In fact, on the most notable occasions, I&#039;ve felt extremely bad for them, and even worse at the simple idea that I&#039;d enjoy such a situation.
So I&#039;ve concocted Parker. Parker isn&#039;t really me; most of the stories I&#039;m telling here are entirely fictional. But Parker&#039;s got my approach: when a girl needs to pee around him, he tries to help her as much as he can. He doesn&#039;t get off on it until later (and I don&#039;t do that, not if the girl in question is a friend of mine; it would be way…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Michelle is feeling that familiar sensation in her bladder, telling her that she had been holding too long and it&#039;s time to go to the toilet. It&#039;s past noon and she hasn&#039;t moved from her desk since she arrived that morning. And worse, all the coffee she drunk all morning has since descended to her bladder.
In another situation she wouldn&#039;t have gave it a second thought and would have walked the thirty steps that separated her office from the toilets (two of them, shared with the rest of the offices on the floor), but that time she couldn&#039;t do it because her sister (the only one that worked with her in the family business) had gone out to do some errands. To being able to go to the toilet, she would&#039;ve had to…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Barbara had managed to get herself into a situation that she had promised to never do again. She had wound up in the third period class in a desperate need to go to the bathroom.
At her school any request to leave the classroom was to be refused so Barbara was left to squirm and fidget throughout the class in the hope she could hold her water until the end of the class. Squirm and fidget she did telegraphing to all her nearby classmates the cause of her distress. Barbara had to pee very badly and her friends knew it.
Barbara was wearing a light blue, denim knee–length straight skirt. I mention all this because Barbara was completely unable to hold herself due to the tightness of her skirt. When Barbara got…</p>
