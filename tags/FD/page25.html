        <p class="card-text">Madison was my best friend in my junior year of high school. We became close almost instantly, and we were almost never apart. We told each other everything, so it was only natural that she told me about how peeing made her come. I told her that I was the exact same way, and within a few months of meeting, we became lovers. We would always go to each other&#039;s houses, or drive somewhere secluded, and act out our most wild fantasies. One day, on the way to a most often deserted field, our most memorable experience occurred. We had started the day by drinking lots of coffee like we always did. Then we got into the car, she was driving, and turned on the radio. Usually, we managed to hold our pee without leaking…</p>

I thought I had sent it just a couple days after part two, but I think I suffered a bit of an organizational breakdown. At any rate it never got sent, but here it is now, better late than never. I hope you all are enjoying reading this– it has gotten longer than I thought it would. At first I thought two parts would take care of it, but it is really a lot of fun to write about, so I&#039;m including all the detail I can remember. I&#039;ve decided to put my e–mail address on this one just so I can hear how you all like my story. You can write me using the link at the bottom of this page.

Hi, I&#039;m Renee, a 28–year–old chemist with Everett Pharmaceuticals. I first saw Gabriele at the company ladies&#039; softball game. She was medium tall, like me, mid twenties with short red hair, and she was clearly unsure of herself as she stood there while sides were being chosen. But I noticed something else besides her shyness. Her thighs and biceps looked strong...this woman worked out. No one else seemed to notice though, and she was chosen last by the other team.
She did not play until the last two innings. At bat with one out and a runner on first, she swings well and hits the ball hard. But it is right at our second baseman who catches it and then catches the runner off first..…</p>

It was a day just like every other day after Inuyasha got over his little &quot;transformation.&quot; Unlike other times, they did not have to fight for their lives. It seemed as though the demons of the surrounding territories had taken a break from hunting them.

        <p class="card-text">We were young and innocent. She was nineteen and I was twenty–three when we moved into the small cheap flat after going steady for three years. No need to bore you with the story of second–hand furniture and the roaming of garage sales, we were soon ready to live happily ever after. Karin was of average height, with brown curls to her breasts, green eyes and a nice girly shape. She preferred jeans and a sweater, but wore the occasional dress to feel womanlier. I&#039;m an ordinary guy. The most out–of–the–ordinary about me she didn&#039;t know about. We had a good sex life when we first started, enjoying each other regularly.

She looked at herself, a brown–haired girl with a white sweater and a denim skirt, with smallish breasts, narrow waist and round hips; a quite ordinary–looking girl of nineteen. Then she lifted her skirt and revealed her panties, and under them, the bulkiness of diapers. Sarah had been looking after her friend Anne&#039;s two–year–old daughter for some time while Anne worked odd shifts at the hospital. Once, as Anne had showed her where the diapers were kept, Sarah had noticed another package.

She had waited all week for this day, when her parents would be out for the day, about 8 hours. That gave her plenty of time to do what she wanted, and clean it all up too. She would lay in bed at night, softly stroking her young pussy, and think about the day that would come, when she could live out her most wild fantasies. Her friend Jane was on her way...
Jane was into peeing too. Both she and Annie were only 18, but they had known each other since they were 5. They went through the everyday accidents of accidentally peeing in their pants when they were little. If one wet her pants, the…</p>

I can&#039;t say the idea of golden showers or shitting holds any appeal for me, but I&#039;ve always been turned on by someone genuinely busting for a pee, preferably with plenty of dramatics, and also enjoy the odd bit of showing off of my own.

He needed to work in the attic and knew it would be best done early, before the Southern California sun turned the attic into an oven.

Ignoring the twinge in his bladder, Zane climbed the ladder and entered the attic. He was glad to see the generous vents at each end of his attic, which would help keep air moving.

This is about desperation I had witnessed. It was funny/cute, classic and innocent...so I thought the desperation fans here would appreciate this story.
This occurred today in my office. I will preface this right now with I KNOW this woman wasn&#039;t testing me for a reaction. She was just comfortable and not the type to be embarrassed in a situation like this... just me and no one else around. Of course I&#039;m not using real names. To set it up... there&#039;s a young, cute, woman (Linda) who works down the hall from me in another department. She also has a sister who works for the same company at…</p>

        <p class="card-text">The instructions in the letter from the hospital were quite clear. &quot;Drink at least 2 pints of water before you attend for Ultrasound scanning, and do not relieve yourself until after the scan. It is important for good results that your bladder is full at the time of the scan.&quot;
Kate was a normally healthy, slender 18–year–old, but she had been having trouble with pains in her abdomen, and the doctor had referred her to the hospital for a scan to see if anything would show up. Now she looked at the letter again. The appointment was for 10:30 a.m., so she didn&#039;t need to leave the house until at least 10, the hospital was only about 15 minutes&#039; walk away.
On the morning of the appointment, the alarm clock rang…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Lucy hobbled hurriedly up to the ladies loo with her hand clasped firmly between her legs. &quot;Please Miss Susan,&quot; she pleaded. &quot;I really need to go to the little girls&#039; room.&quot; Susan was in the middle of smoothing a &quot;Toilet Closed&quot; sign onto the toilet door. She had made this, her third desperation party, a fancy dress school disco themed party and it was so good to see everyone really getting into the spirit of it. Lucy was wearing a short blue pleated skirt, which was now bunched firmly between her legs, and her blonde pigtails and pained expression really completed the effect.
&quot;Is it urgent?&quot; asked Susan.
&quot;Yes miss, ooh it&#039;s an emergency!&quot;

        <p class="card-text">I am at work. I am married to the most beautiful woman in the world, and she never leaves my thoughts. As another boring day goes on I compose this story:
Michelle wakes up and stretches her light brown body, then curls up again knowing it is still early, letting her hands rub her round belly and a little further down as well. A little later she rises, naked, and enters the bathroom where she meets herself in the full–length mirror. She likes to be seen. At thirty–five she has a perfect butt– probably as a product of her Caribbean ancestry, and a narrow waist above full hips. Her breasts are quite small, but very pretty; her black hair reaches her nipples when she straightens it. She turns on the taps.

        <p class="card-text">The two girls were just hanging around outside the town&#039;s center, the burger stand. They were almost identically dressed, in tight designer jeans and white tops showing their bellies, one slightly rounder, and the other slightly shorter. Both had brown hair to their shoulders and were looking around to see where the action was. Being a local lad and an experienced hanger–around I immediately drifted over to see if I could be of service.
— Hi there, the tallest said. –Anything happen around here?
— This is it, I said. –First time here, right?
The shorter girl nodded. –We&#039;re staying at the hostel with our class, but got sort of tired of card games and giggling boys.
Her friend poked her side and got a tickle…</p>
