        <p class="card-text">Night of the Living Wet (Part 3)
Episode 3 – &#039;Till Wet do us Part
Laurie&#039;s jeep stopped with screaming tires at her sorority dorm. The door on the passenger side swung open immediately, and Kitty jumped out; her jeans were thoroughly soaked, she had already peed in her pants on two separate occasions but her bladder still wasn&#039;t empty – and her need remained. She took a few steps towards the dorm, but then looked back to see what was keeping the others. Laurie was helping Cathy, who was still crying and sobbing –as she had been all through the drive over here–, out of the car. She was trembling, clothed in nothing but a soiled T–shirt and her soaking wet panties. &quot;Will you hurry up!&quot; Kitty screamed, &quot;I still…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Ashley wasn&#039;t the most popular girl, or the best looking. However, Kevin didn&#039;t care. He liked her for her personality. 
On the day school was out, Ashley was very busy, She would go to school, do everything there, then she would come home and immediately go to the orthodontist. Then it was off to physical therapy, because she broke her arm a while back. Then she was going to Kevin&#039;s for dinner, and then off to the movies. 
At the end of the school day, her bladder was already feeling it. Through the orthodontist appt., she was squirming the whole time. By the time it was dinner, she couldn&#039;t imagine making it till about 10:30, the end of the movie.

        <p class="card-text">Elizabeth Jones closed the door behind her and put the briefcase on the desk. Interesting stuff, this seminar, but enough was enough. Time to get out of business clothes and ponder the possibilities. She removed her dark blue jacket and skirt, unbuttoned her blouse, and enjoyed moving about wearing tights, panties and bra. For some reason hotel rooms made her feel erotic. Could be the undressing in strange quarters, knowing there were people behind the walls; maybe the dominating, inviting double bed; maybe the chance to meet someone in the bar or restaurant. She touched the nylon roundness of her belly, conscious of a need to relieve herself. She smiled, recalling stories of peeing in hotel beds. She had done…</p>

        <p class="card-text">I started studying with Miss Anderson at fourteen. I had played for as long as I can remember, and was ready to go on to more difficult pieces – thence the private lessons. Miss Anderson was around thirty and usually dressed in proper skirt and blouse, with her auburn hair tied into a bun. Still, she was the object of my fantasies, being a woman who took me seriously, as opposed to the girls of my own age, who were either plain and giggly or pretty and condescending. She was petite, about my height at that time, and the decent clothes did not hide her womanly shape. I kept my dreams a secret for four years. After returning that autumn from three months&#039; break, I found myself a couple of inches taller, with…</p>

She said hi and smiled expectantly at me. Who am I to turn someone down? –Like a drink, I said. She nodded, pigtails waving. –Beer is fine. While waiting we introduced ourselves. Her name was Carrie. I resisted suggesting carrying her home, as she seemed to have gotten the same idea. The crowd was pushing, and she swayed on her feet, pushing a breast against my arm or a hip against my thigh. I admit to feeling something rise down there. –You here alone, she asked, very close to my ear. –Not really. –Oh. Well, I don&#039;t have company. She brushed…</p>

        <p class="card-text">I&#039;ve been into peeing since I was a teenager, and I did a lot of stuff in the privacy of my bedroom when I was in high school. I had a few close calls during junior high and high school, where I leaked a little into my panties, but nothing that anyone noticed. One of my most memorable experiences happened in college. I went to a small private school that was out in the middle of nowhere. During my junior year, I took summer classes so I could graduate one semester early. One Saturday in late July, one of the student groups organized a day trip to an amusement park that was about 150 miles away. They chartered a bus, and we left at 9:00 o&#039;clock in the morning. The bus was very comfortable, with air conditioning…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Nancy was well aware of the beer drinker&#039;s rule of thumb; during the first six beers you will most likely forgo taking a trip to the rest room. But, when you finally do succumb to an aching bladder after the first six you will find that you have to answer the call immediately and that the call will occur often. More accidents occur after the first six beers in a beer drinking session than at any other time. Nancy had numerous experiences with beer drinking sessions but she had never had an accident until... Nancy was in a neighborhood tavern drinking with her new boyfriend and she noticed that she had just finished her sixth beer.

In fact the whole family occasionally went along and they picnicked. Nancy&#039;s father was an avid fly fisherman and since Nancy was like all young daughters she wanted to engage in her fathers favorite pastime. When she was thirteen she was an accomplished fly fisherman. By the time she reached fourteen, her parents had divorced. Nancy was sent to live with her mother. She was devastated; she loved being with her Dad. After that, she was only able to see him sporadically, due to school and his work schedule. 
One Friday evening after Nancy had reached the age of eighteen her father called and asked if she wanted to go trout…</p>

She had gone to a few concerts before, and it was my first time, so I looked to her to know what to do and what to wear. She told me to wear a knee–length skirt and thick panties underneath. On top I should wear something lose, not tucked into my skirt. I looked trough my wardrobe and found the outfit she described. When the big day finally arrived we went to the concert area early so we would have a real good spot. My sister told me to go to the bathroom now; for we wouldn&#039;t be able to go until the show was over if we wanted the spot.

        <p class="card-text">A few weeks after I had peed my jeans in the rain with my sister I was in the park with a good friend of mine, Jo–Anne. We were goofing around and having fun in the nice weather when Jo–Anne suddenly told me we had to find a toilet. She had had to pee for a while, as did I, and a bit escaped. We went to where the toilets were in the park, or rather, usually were. The city had apparently had had enough of the vandalism, and the toilets had been removed. Jo–Anne doubled over in pain and told me she&#039;d never make it home. She barely got here and she was about to pee her jeans. I felt sorry for her and told her she would be able to make it if she just tried. With a tear falling down her cheek she told me she couldn…</p>

        <p class="card-text">This story was told to me by a friend who attends a small college of about 1200 students: I lived in the biggest dorm of all of them. It was an all female dorm and there were 50 of us living there. It was the oldest dorm on campus and originally the only one. Since it had been built for far fewer students many rooms had been converted into living quarters, leaving only one toilet for all 50 of us.
Weekday mornings were the worst. I would wake up with that full feeling in my bladder just bursting to go, never knowing how long the line at the toilet would be. It was unfortunately in the same room as the shower, which made waiting times even longer since girls would go in there and shower and pee and brush every…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Wow what a weekend I just had, let me tell you all about it! Last weekend it was the Queen&#039;s Golden Jubilee celebration down in London. My wealthy but divorced cousin Fran was very lucky and got two tickets in her grown up daughters&#039; names for the pop concert on the Monday night in the Garden at Buckingham Palace. Claire, 24 and Holly, 20, the two very good looking daughters, top shelf in fact, were to be the lucky recipients of the tickets. Both girls live in Chelsea. Fran asked me if I would like to go down to London for the weekend. Our families are very close as we all grew up together in the same town. Fran is 10 years older than I, and seems to be missing male company since her messy divorce. She felt…</p>

        <p class="card-text">I work at a medium–sized IT–development firm where we develop large–scale applications for other firms. Doing an intake for a new assignment starts with a visit to the customer by a technician and an account manager. 
When I was still a novice I was told to join Mrs. Carpenter in such an intake trip. Mrs. Carpenter was one of the top sales executives, but most of the men thought about her as the woman who knew how to dress. She always wore suits with skirts that never ended at or below the knee. She always walked on spike–heeled pumps. In the company&#039;s cafeteria, I used to admire her muscular, yet very feminine legs with bulging, rock–hard calves, which she always crossed in an equally feminine manner. Not…</p>
