Mandy had an unusual relationship with her boss and lover, Doug. Outside of work, he was everything she could ask for in a man; he was kind, passionate, and extremely fun to be with. However, the situation was a little different at work. He had requested that their relationship should be kept a secret for now, because it looked unprofessional and he was fearful of getting of being perceived as someone who took advantage of women who worked for him. He asked her to continue to address him as Mr. Welsh at work and not to show any public displays of affection at the office. He promised her that he would tell…</p>

        <p class="card-text">One morning I had tons of laundry to do, having put it off for a week or more. My roommate Jess and I are in college, and we live on the second floor of our apartment complex. The laundry room is in the basement, shared by all the tenants in that section of the complex. The laundry room is also the storage room, with each apartment&#039;s storage cubbies around the edge of the basement.
I made sure to get up early so I could be the first one to get my laundry in. Usually Saturdays were the busiest time for laundry so I avoided that day. This was a Friday morning and hopefully there would be no one getting their laundry in before me since I had so much to do.
I had about three baskets worth to carry down with…</p>

Could there be anything worse on a coach outing? Joan wondered.
She was dying to go to the loo and did not know when she was going to be able to? It was one of those nightmare situations that she dreaded and always pretended would never happen to her. As she looked out of the coach window at the passing London suburbs, Joan tried to recognise where they were and wondered anxiously how much longer it would be before they stopped for a loo break.
In fact, although she did not want think about it, the real question was; how much longer she could wait until she absolutely had to get to a loo? She seemed to have been sitting for ever with her legs crossed,…</p>

        <p class="card-text">My job was assistant personal secretary to a senior manager. Actually I was a glorified messenger for much of the time. The manager liked to have an attractive girl to take his messages to clients or other departments in our bank. He insisted I was always smartly dressed, and I was happy to oblige him in this.
My chief attraction is my neat figure. Otherwise I am average in almost all areas. I have shoulder length brown to mousy hair. I am about average height, and would never win a beauty contest. I have always played a lot of tennis, squash and badminton, so I am slim and have what I think is a sexy little bottom. I also have a tiny bladder, which is more of an embarrassment than an asset, but I have…</p>

In spite of the fact that she was almost twenty years older than me we became good friends and shared a lot of interests. She cared a lot about her appearance, always dressed in stylish clothes, suits with trousers or skirts and looked much younger.
On this particular Friday evening she came from work and quickly prepared for a company dinner. As might be expected for such occasion, she was in a suit with the…</p>

I had been expecting something challenging and unexpected to leap out at any point that first semester, but it never did. I relaxed a lot about my schoolwork then. I still did well, but allowed myself to have a social life as well.
I still wasn&#039;t a big house–party person. Those things are just annoying to me. A bunch of my friends were having a dorm party though, with one of those giant jugs of vodka and a couple of gallons of Tampico. I was pumped.
We all started drinking and playing Strip Monopoly, the rules of which still confuse me. I was wearing my college freshman…</p>

Carla looked into the mirror and smiled – her new date for tonight would be more than satisfied by her appearance tonight. Of course, they all were. Carla was that type of girl who made guys turn round their heads whenever she passed by – she had long black hair, a cute face, tanned, and wonderful figure (28 inch waist) and sexy ass. She never had any shortage of boyfriends, and this was something she reminded all of her girl mates, which was probably why she had very few girl friends.

Within his limits Dad was a good father. He made me work hard at school, he encouraged me to read widely, and he was always very patient answering my questions. But it was all in the world of the mind. The fact that his darling daughter had a bladder, bowels and a womb was something he could not really get his head round.
So the bodily aspects of my upbringing were all left to Mum. Sex was dealt with quite simply; it could be summed up in one sentence: &quot;Wait till you&#039;re married.&quot; Sometimes I seemed to pick up the implication…</p>

Felicia, a new servant girl of the castle, finished gulping down the contents of a tankard of ale. She shifted uncomfortably on the mahogany bench. Already the effects of the two previous tankards began to hit her bladder, and she knew that she&#039;d have to pee soon. Looking around the hall, she noticed a number of other servant girls also looking rather uncomfortable. For reasons she didn&#039;t know, the castle&#039;s lord always made sure his female servants drank a lot during feasts. Perhaps it was some odd kink he had, she didn&#039;t know.

Mandy looked at her reflection in the mirror for the umpteenth time that morning. She had to make sure that she looked perfect. It was an important day for her– she had to make sure she looked as attractive as possible. She was dressed in a tight white t–shirt with no bra, showing off her perfectly round breasts and erect nipples. She wore a tight denim skirt, short enough to reveal her light pink cotton panties when she bent over. She wished she was brave enough to wear her favourite pair of skinny jeans, but couldn&#039;t bring herself to risk the consequences of that just yet.

I work for a large manufacturing company in the UK, and management had decided that we were to have a three–day team training exercise. We were to spend the three team training days at a large hotel in the country, all expenses paid, and most of us were quite excited at the idea. After all, the company was paying and it was a break from the normal daily routine.
Well, the day came and we all boarded the luxurious coaches that had been laid on and after a journey of about an hour and a half, we arrived at the hotel.…</p>

        <p class="card-text">It was finally that day, a cloudy Saturday morning that my worst nightmare came about. Well, I had to visit my relatives in another city and I hate throwing my precious time off the cliff doing some pointless stuff. However I had no idea, they would probably say that I had forgotten them or I had abandoned our very good relationship if I were to deny this invitation, not to mention that it was holiday. Honestly, I&#039;d rather slack at home for some sexy omorashi videos.
Before long, I reached the airport earlier than expected; I was anticipating a rain that might cause a traffic jam to occur at first, though the cloudy sky remained calm. I bought a Fillet O&#039; Fish from McDonald&#039;s and began eating mindlessly.…</p>

        <p class="card-text">The Seattle city center traffic was so bad that it was often joked that it caused people to become junkies and then kill themselves. It made sense as the city was famously known for being the center of the early 90’s grunge scene, a short–lived but significant era in rock music, with bands such as Nirvana, Alice in Chains, Pearl Jam, and Soundgarden. Two of the more influential grunge bands, Nirvana and Alice in Chains abruptly ended following the suicides of their lead singers in the mid 90’s.
Mandy, currently stuck in the same afternoon Seattle traffic, sighed deeply as her frustration mounted behind the wheel of her 2004 Volkswagen Golf. She was on her way home from work, a commute that was no more than 20…</p>

        <p class="card-text">It was a cold, wintry day, when Sarah woke up. It was still dark outside and the wind was blowing hard against the window. She immediately noticed her very bad need to pee. She was almost bursting. The need was so bad that she was actually frightened to move. She felt that any tiny movement might make her loose bladder control immediately.
She was laying there, in her nice, warm bed, with her comfy terrycloth pyjamas on, her heart hammering against her chest. &quot;I need to get up,&quot; she thought. &quot;I need to go to the bathroom, quickly!&quot; &quot;I can&#039;t move. I just can&#039;t, or I will pee the bed&quot; was the immediate afterthought.
Trembling, she was lying there, trying to make up the courage to try it. To make herself hold…</p>
