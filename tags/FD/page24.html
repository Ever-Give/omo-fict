Kristine had two fingers pressing on the track&#039;s hard surface, her other arm cocked at her left side. Her Nike track shoes were pressed against the starting blocks, white socks barely showing above the edge of the shoe line, her calve muscles taut, her perfectly shaped, sleek yet athletic thighs tensed as she awaited the starting gunshot. A slight sheen of perspiration shone on her legs and arms. A single drop of perspiration fell from her nose, falling to the tracks surface, a small dark circle where it fell. Crouched in starting stance, her face stared down the straightaway of the track, her butt sticking up in the air, her short green nylon…</p>

        <p class="card-text">I went shopping today. I don&#039;t do that real often, at least not the cruise–the–mall, visit–every–store kind of shopping. But today I needed to buy some clothes so I found myself in a mall. There was a sale going on and I wanted to get a couple of blouses and a skirt that had been advertised, so I first went to get them, but when I got to the car with my purchases I decided there was no reason to head for home and I might as well take a wander around.
I must have spent an hour or so wandering up and down the mall, checking out different stores and finally stopping to get a cup of coffee. For a while I just sat and watched the people go by, wondering about their stories and making up stories to go with their…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Kari was a beautiful young girl just out of high school. She had always been incredibly shy, but her smile more than made up for it. After moving away to college she desperately needed a job to pay her bills, but in a college town, jobs can be hard to come by. She wore a tight fitting red blouse, tight khaki pants, and white cotton panties.
After a long day of tedious interviews, Kari was walking back to her dorm when she realized she had far too much to drink on her lunch break. Being new in town she did not know of anywhere she could just stop in to use the rest room, plus she figured, &quot;I&#039;m a grown adult, I&#039;ll be fine.&quot;
Her pace became quicker on the way back to her dorm as she realized she REALLY had to…</p>

        <p class="card-text">I had the most exciting experience with a big bladdered woman some years ago. I found a new love with a fascinating woman for a longer time.
This two–part story really happened some years ago and I have NOT elaborated or changed any of the described facts!
I won&#039;t tell you her name, but she was a slim and sporty woman of 32 years at the time and had very long, dark, brown hair. She was very beautiful, and had a fascinating smile– and she had the best–trained, incredibly massive, persistent bladder that I have ever found. She was very tough and had really strong nerves– a fascinating woman also possessing many other good qualities but that&#039;s not the theme of this water sports community.

My 2nd cousin Julia, myself, and other family and friends met up at the cemetery for the funeral of an aged great Aunt. It was not a sad event; she was over 90, but a chance to remember her life. It was a cool but nice bright January day, I saw Julia standing near the Chapel entrance, so I went over to say hello. She is 29, tall, slim, hazel eyes with mousy hair tied up. We exchanged a few words and she asked if I had been there before.
I said I had, so she asked if I knew if there was a toilet near by, as she badly needed to take a leak. I said I had used a men&#039;s room last time, which was in the basement down steps outside around the back, so I guessed that there would be a ladies&#039;…</p>

Madeline was a sweet 19–year–old girl (In her mid 20&#039;s now) that used to live down the road from where I used to live. In fact, sometimes I dreamed about her. She was the nicest, not to mention the most beautiful girl in the neighborhood. She stood about 5&#039; 11&quot;, weighed about 120 pounds, long red curly hair, green eyes, bright red lips, and a dark complexion. She was pretty popular in those days, but she never went out much after she left high school. For some reason (which I do not know to this day) she didn&#039;t carry on any relationships past high school.
One hot summer evening, at an ice cream stand, we finally stood toe to toe for the first time since the 7th grade. She had claimed…</p>

I&#039;d been going out with Sarah for quite some time, and we had a fairy normal boyfriend/girlfriend relationship in all respects. I had never mentioned my interest in watersports and I&#039;d never had the slightest indication that she was interested either. Then one day we decided to go to the seaside. We wanted somewhere fairly secluded, so the trip turned into a long weekend in Cornwall. I don&#039;t remember exactly where we ended up – we stayed at a B&amp;B in Truro, but we drove for quite a while before we found what we were looking for. The beach was perfect – a…</p>

About five or six years ago, soon after Sarah and I first met, she came to me with an idea for a short break. She had seen some information about a riding center in the Scottish Highlands, where you could ride out around Loch Ness, and being a keen horsewoman she thought it might be fun to combine that with a few days&#039; holiday. I was OK with the idea, as I love the Scottish mountains, so the idea became a plan. She also asked if a friend of hers, Abigail, could come along too. We booked rooms at a B&amp;B in the village of Drumnadrochit, which is right on the edge of Loch Ness and very close to the riding center,…</p>

I enjoy wetting myself. If you&#039;ve been reading my stories from last summer that should be pretty obvious.

        <p class="card-text">Note: This &quot;story&quot; contains Female Desperation.
In 1990, I was in hospital for some months– I was very ill and had to build up for a difficult surgical operation. There I liked to visit the nurses who had to do the night shift. I could do that, because I was near to the inventory of the station and knew the girls a little better after a while. A fixed night nurse regularly did the night shift for one week as well as another of the nurses from the station, and they worked on a rotating system, so when the fixed night nurse had her week off, each of them did the shift in her place.

One of these nurses, Silke, used to drink 3 liters of red tea. It was some kind of fruit tea, which seemed to have a bit of a…</p>

        <p class="card-text">It was several weeks since Kate&#039;s incident with the scan. On several occasions, she&#039;d experimented at home with pee–holding games, drinking several strong cups of coffee and then waiting until she was bursting before allowing herself the luxury of going to the toilet. She found that the feeling of desperation aroused her sexually. On a couple of occasions she&#039;d had minor &quot;accidents,&quot; caused by her younger siblings occupying the bathroom at inconvenient moments, just as she&#039;d decided she couldn&#039;t wait any longer. There was a thrill in the unexpected need to hold on for an additional few minutes, and once she&#039;d started leaking as she had that day of the scan– with spurts of pee had began coming out every few…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Joe was a good guy, an older friend always willing to take some risks on our behalf. He said he&#039;d be glad to pick up a case of beer for us. We were all under 21 and too young to buy beer in the state where we lived in the Northeastern United States.
At the senior prom dance that June evening in the mid–1950s, I danced only with Maddy, a girl I&#039;d been going with for about a year. We were kindred spirits, similar interests, but where I was shy and retiring, she was bubbly and outgoing. I was very comfortable with her. She drew me out and helped me overcome my shyness. However, we never had sex.
Charlie and Lisa, Phil and Marge, and Maddy and I left the prom about 11 p.m. and piled into Charlie&#039;s 1954 Mercury…</p>

        <p class="card-text">This is the first story I&#039;ve written and it happened to me a couple of days ago. I&#039;m 25 years old, and have been married for three years. My wife Ashley and I started going out when we were 16 and have been together ever since. She&#039;s hot, blond with a killer figure. Ashley is the kind of girl everyone likes, she&#039;s sweet, kind and very sexy, and I&#039;m very protective of her. I have seen her desperate to pee about three times in our relationship, and one of them was at school. She knows that it&#039;s my fantasy to see her like this, but she very never does it, so I was surprised the other day.
I woke up at ten on Saturday and looked at my sexy wife. She is shopping obsessed, and has a dozen things to sleep in, but…</p>
