        <p class="card-text">You know how there are people out to get you, even when you haven&#039;t done anything to them? That was what it was like for Clara Birks. It was her first year in the sorority, and she wanted to make a good impression on the girls. Clara was about 5&#039;5, 105 lbs, with brown hair and brown eyes. She was merely average. So why did Amanda Poole hate her so much? Some think it was because when attending the initiation, Amanda wet herself in fear, and mistook Clara&#039;s laughter at her friends for laughter at Amanda&#039;s embarrassing accident. Who knows, but after that night, Amanda had regained her dignity by cliquing up in her rich circle of friends. Amanda soon became the ringleader of the popular crowd of 5. There was Kali…</p>

21–year–old woke up one morning and tossed off her sheets, which were slightly damp. She reached down and felt the bottom of her light blue cotton thong, which was fairly dry, but still a little damp. She cursed her small bladder and got out of bed, her long blonde hair flowing down to just above her tight little ass. She shook out of her panties, letting them drop the floor, and ripped the sheets off the bed, moving to the kitchen and putting them in the washer. She noticed the time was 8:50 and wanted to leave at 9 for her shopping, so she ran back into her room and threw open her drawer, grabbing a pair of pink cotton bikini panties, pulling them over her long legs and covering her delicate bush.…</p>

She was browsing for some new sports clothes, window–shopping mainly, and her only purchase so far had been a large coke from McDonalds. Holly was an outgoing girl, and was enjoying being 18 and home from college for the summer. She was wearing an old pair of ripped jeans that she had cut off into shorts, and a red vest with &quot;Party Girl&quot; emblazoned across her firm round breasts. The vest was tight and short, showing her nipples since she wasn&#039;t wearing a bra, while leaving her tummy bare and exposed. She felt the cool air over her bare skin as the afternoon cooled gradually. She took slow, rolling strides from her hips as she walked, and smiled…</p>

        <p class="card-text">My girlfriend, Michelle, and I went on a trip out of town a few weeks ago. We drove to a town that about 8 hours away to see a really big concert– the biggest event of the year. We had been looking forward to it for a long time (all weekend alone together... away from home). So we packed up our bags, loaded into my SUV, and headed off. We made it there in good time. Checked into a hotel. All that. So for two days we strolled around the concert grounds enjoying all the live performances by all the bands. And each night, we&#039;d wind up having even more fun in our hotel room– and in the hotel hot tubs (but that&#039;s another story).
Anyway... The bathrooms at the concert weren&#039;t wonderful, but they weren&#039;t the…</p>

If I had superhuman abilities, I would like to get invisible and to have mind–control over strong bladdered women. It should be possible to find them by their thoughts while they are holding it. Afterwards I would read and manipulate their minds while looking inside of them while they are doing their best to hold it.
Then the following situation would be possible. Possibly it could also happen without any manipulation, just because these two women are very ambitious and really tough.
Note from Ger: This story is of course complete fiction. Don&#039;t even try to hold your pee as long as written below. Not even in a kind of sadistic game. Holding your pee too long –…</p>

We were driving all the way from home (NE, US) to southern Indiana, where we planned to ride our bikes (along with 250 other bike nuts) hundreds of miles through the hill country. We decided to split the drive into 2 days and play along the way. Early on the morning of day 2 we stopped in Wal–Mart to pick up another camp chair so there would be someplace to sit at the end of the day...just in case. After we found the perfect chair, and restocked the cooler with water and soft drinks, I started for the checkout line.
But OSO headed me off, herding me instead to the pharmacy section. He&#039;d never been in this town before in his life, but he…</p>

After we got off the bikes we decided to stay the night in town, getting up early the next morning to start the drive home, though we were still gonna split the drive into 2 days. We were in no rush to return to the real world. We were much more interested in playing. We&#039;re good at that.
So the next morning we hit the road. First stop – breakfast.
We&#039;d ridden our bikes over hundreds of miles of hills and eaten our way across an entire state and back again... but we were hungry. We pull into a Cracker Barrel (shoving aside several cars in an effort to find a parking place) and I headed for the door.

After our experiences on the beach, I couldn&#039;t wait to find out what Sarah had in mind for a holding on contest. I had to wait until we got home, because she said what she had planned would be far too messy to contemplate in the B&amp;B we had been staying at in Cornwall.

        <p class="card-text">I eventually got into the habit of mostly holding on all day at school and not going to the toilet. I think this probably started from spending so much time with the boys. While girls often tend to go to the toilet together, boys are much more haphazard. For example, if we were in the middle of a game of cricket or something during lunch time we&#039;d keep playing as long as we possibly could after the bell rang, and only when it was too late to go would I realize I really could have done with a visit to the toilet. The only acceptable option then would be to just hold on for the rest of the afternoon, which I always managed to, refusing to ask to be excused during class.

My lovely &quot;Bladder Queen&quot; was a tourist guide who rode in double–decker sight seeing busses. We were in love and a couple for a few years. She often waited way too long and then (deliberately) would be shivering with her legs, to hold it a little easier. But she just did this when we both were at home. Outside she never showed any (visible) sign of her often really urgent need to pee. When she got really desperate in public, she just whispered into my ear that she could not hold it any longer. But my friend never wet her panties, not even when desperately…</p>

        <p class="card-text">This is a true story of a sighting I had of a girl my age (18) when I was in my senior year of high school.
We had weekly assemblies, all standing in the open assembly area, just before lunchtime. My mates and I usually tried to stand behind a row of girls so we could check them out. I particularly enjoyed studying the shape of their bottoms under their uniforms and imagining I could see right through to their pants. One day in an assembly I found myself particularly transfixed by an extremely attractive girl in front and just across to the left. She was fairly new to the school and just perfect – not too skinny but not fat; solid, athletic looking legs that went &quot;all the way up&quot; before disappearing under the…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Unlike my previous submissions, this one is at least based in fact. Sarah is still a figment of my imagination, as are the other characters in this tale, but most of these events did happen...
31st December 1999, and the prospect of the biggest party either of us had ever seen had Sarah and myself traveling south to London to join in the fun. We decided that the best policy would probably be to leave the car well outside the city center and take a train to Waterloo; so early in the evening we left the car at Feltham and continued our journey by rail. We arrived at Waterloo at about 7:00pm and set about deciding on a good spot to watch the fireworks from. Close to the London Eye seemed a good prospect but the…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Jamie was at her aunt&#039;s house, visiting her sick cousin. Nothing serious, just a bout with the flu, but her cousin was too tired and exhausted to get out of bed for anything, including to pee. So her aunt had bought her dear cousin Marie teenager–sized diapers, to make things easier on her. Her aunt needed to run some errands, so Jamie stayed to keep Marie company.
&quot;So, um, I&#039;m really sorry you&#039;re sick.&quot;
&quot;Yeah, me too, but it&#039;s not so bad being waited on hand and foot, and having your diaper changed like a baby.&quot;
&quot;Geez, I don&#039;t know about you, but I could never go back to diapers, having someone know when I&#039;ve peed or pooped, and having them change me.&quot;
&quot;Oh, but I enjoy it. Not to mention, between you and…</p>
