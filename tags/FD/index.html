        <p class="card-text">This story contains Female Desperation, Humiliation, Female Wetting, Female Peeing, and Golden Showers. When I got home, no one was around, so I quietly went to my room, changed clothes and went straight to bed. There was so much to dream about: wet panties, soaked pussies, and overwhelming ladies! Two weeks passed and nothing had happened. The weather was rather rainy and I had chosen to ride my bike or hitch a ride whenever some neighbor&#039;s kid had the same hours as I did. But summer came back and so did my desire to pick up my clothes. Doubtless, Mom would ask for them now that the weather allowed wearing them again. And maybe there was something else that attracted me to that house with a birch tree in…</p>

This is a memoir of real events, which took place in the early 1980&#039;s, in the Spring, long after Mardi Gras, probably in May. My partner was &quot;Michelle&quot; (not her real name, of course), my girlfriend of the time, who became a long term friend and lover, over more than 10 years. This trip did a lot to make our relationship closer and more intimate. It happened early in our time together, probably about two years after we originally met. At that time, she was a petite, slender lady, with dark hair, green eyes, very smooth skin, and naturally very sparse pubic hair. She was so &quot;pee shy&quot;, when I met her, that she ran tap water to cover her…</p>

My parents didn&#039;t think I should be given a car, so usually I preferred riding my bike to school. But since that memorable day, I chose to walk home more often, benefitting from the fact that I could get a lift in the morning by a neighbor working close to my school. I knew my parents didn&#039;t expect me home at a specific time &#039; after all I was old enough to care for myself &#039; and I kept wandering along quiet roads, immersed in memories of &quot;Lady Birch&quot;: In my dreams I had needed a name for her, so I christened her after the tree standing in her front yard.At the same time, Lady Birch had started to feel qualms…</p>

This morning, she had had quite some milk in her cereal, drank two glasses of fresh garden fruit smoothie &#039; there were just so many fruit in her garden &#039; and later she had slowly sipped through the contents of two bottles of mineral water whilst going about the normal house work.

It was by no means the tallest tower in New York City, but definitely one of the city&#039;s finest. It had been constructed over the past two years, 1988 and 1989.The rumour on the street whispered that it had cost Stephen Burns Jr. over twenty million dollars.Glancing at the directory sign, Karen confirmed that she was going to the top floor and hit the elevator button. She took a sip of her large coffee as the elevator arrived. It had been a restless night, with a big day looming.

Note: This story contains Female Desperation &amp; Wetting, and Masturbation. I first discovered the pleasurable aspects of wetting my knickers while at university. It all began when I became friendly with a group of girls in the folk music club and began to frequent the various pubs in the area. For some reason cider was our preferred drink, being cheap and strong – despite its well known diuretic properties.When I first joined the group I was amused by the frequent references to ending up with &quot;cider legs&quot; if one of us drank too much. I assumed this to mean drunk, but was to find out otherwise, though our frequent visits to the ladies loo and the fact that I knew that…</p>

This had led to some incredibly risky lovemaking outside their homes– at the movies, in the quiet corners of the public library, even the bathroom stalls at school. The risk of getting discovered turned them on immensely and they had barely escaped some close calls. Jamie received a phone call from Misty the day after the wetting incident at the bar. Being the experimental type and a closet wetter for many years, Misty was dying for more fun with Jamie and Kiran. However, getting to Mistys apartment during her free hours was a difficult task for the two schoolgirls living under the close…</p>

A recent forum post asked about early experiences so perhaps I should tell about mine. I never had any problems when I was younger; as far as I can remember I never wet my knickers or my bed until my late teens, although I can recall several incidents involving friends. In most cases they wet themselves laughing, probably the main cause of accidents for teenage girls. In my case I was a poised and confident student of 19 when I first experienced the thrill and embarassment of weeing myself, though as two of my friends also soaked their pants at the same time we had a good laugh about it. The three of us had gone to an open air…</p>

Note: This story contains Female Desperation &amp; Wetting, Bed Wetting, and &amp; Masturbation. Work has been hell recently. I have really been under pressure to complete a major project to get some complex documentation complete and the whole thing has been dogged by problems. As a result I have had sleepless nights and have felt really stressed out, the eventual result of which proved rather embarassing. At the end of a particularly bad week my friends persuaded me to go out for a drink on Friday night. I arrived home more relaxed and rather drunk, though not excessively so, took a quick shower and tumbled into bed. Around 6.30, half asleep and confused, I realized something was…</p>

        <p class="card-text">I had worked with Claire for about three years when these events happened. She was a bubbly, outgoing character, very flirtatious and always willing to share a dirty joke or two.We were never more than work colleagues, friends I suppose, but certainly never romantically involved.It was the middle of a typical British summer and the night of the office barbecue.Surprisingly, it wasn&#039;t raining, but the promise of storms to come on the weather forecast didn&#039;t bode well.The barbecue was always held in the large garden of a pub near to the offices, and we basically took the place over for the evening.Plenty of food and plenty of drink was had by all, but eventually it was time to head for home.I had a fairly long…</p>

Day 2
The next morning Carie woke Linda up. &quot;I need to wash your leggings, or they will stain and smell.&quot; Linda dressed and gave her mother her leggings. After they walked down the stairs and into the kitchen Carie told Linda to sit down, they needed to talk. &quot;Dear, I can&#039;t thank you enough for showing me the wonders of peeing in your pants and I realise you want to do it often. Since I share that feeling I won&#039;t forbid you to wet yourself, but I do need to make a few rules for this. First, never do it on the wooden floors, they would bite out and the floor would be ruined. If you want you can go in the kitchen, but you need…</p>

        <p class="card-text">In theory it ought to be almost impossible to wet your knickers while travelling with a caravan, after all, you are towing a toilet with you! Of course, on a motorway journey there are few problems as there are plenty of service stations to stop at, though traffic jams can be almost as difficult as when traveling solo. It&#039;s the smaller cross–country roads that cause the problems. Although there are pull–ins on A–roads these are often full of commercial vehicles, with no room for a car and caravan, while on many B–roads places to stop can be very few and far between. Not useful for someone with a rather weak and irritable bladder.On long trips there have been many times when I have been absolutely desperate…</p>
