        <p class="card-text">When Ian and Lucy had gone, Joan, who at the time was managing the shop, summoned one of the assistants to look after the shop, and then made her way to her office. She was about to sit down, when she remembered that the panties she had on were wet, and would mark her skirt. She was about to remove them when suddenly the memory of what she had witnessed looking through the spy hole in the changing cubical, came back with vivid lucidity. In her mind&#039;s eye she again saw Lucy with her legs wrapped round Ian&#039;s waist, his prick squashed up the leg of the panties thrust in her pleasure hole pumping in and out of Lucy&#039;s cunt, and how the stimulated girl had been unable to refrain from pissing when she came, soaking…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Since the beginning of high school, they always met each other at the bus stop, near their houses. Every morning Jenni would show up in her school uniform; a plaid skirt or blue slacks, a white polo shirt or a white button down shirt, and or course the white socks. She usually wore the plaid skirt to show off her long legs. Both Stacy and Jenni had blonde hair, and brown eyes, and a golden tan.As usual, Stacy got to the bus stop before Jenni arrived, so she started to study for a test. About ten minutes had gone by and Stacy was beginning to worry that Jenni wasn&#039;t going to school today. But a minute before the bus got there, Stacy saw Jenni running towards the bus stop. She felt relieved but Jenni was not…</p>

One day I went to a birthday party for a friend. We had plenty of beer and soft drinks and everyone was having a good time. Nothing unusual happened until the drinks started to catch up with me and I went to the bathroom to recycle some beer.The bathroom was upstairs and there didn&#039;t seem to be anyone else around so I went in but didn&#039;t bother to lock the door. I realized that I had to poop too so I sat down and started to pee. Suddenly the door opened and a girl came in. She wasn&#039;t my girl friend but we were good friends. She had her dress pulled way up and I could see her white cotton panties. Her hand was between her legs and she was rubbing her pussy.…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Kate shifted her weight, balancing evenly on both feet, and moved her legs about 18 inches apart. It was going to happen any second now, so she tensed her muscles and really started to concentrate. The tension was slowly killing her, she could feel her muscles starting to quiver and she knew that once it was all over she could finally take a deep breathe and relax. It was coming, and there was nothing she could do to stop it.
She saw movement, her brain tracked it, and she flung herself to the right, stretching her leg as far as it would go. The hockey ball struck the outside of her pad, clipping a metal buckle, and deflected past the outside of the goalpost. &quot;Save&quot;, she thought, as the umpire blew the…</p>

        <p class="card-text">This story is based on something that happened in a ballet class I used to take. It was the first time I had witnessed a major accident by another girl who wasn&#039;t a child and I found the experience incredibly interesting.
Emily rushed into the house, running late after spending too much time with her friends that morning. It was nearing noon, but there was no time for lunch as she had to rush off to ballet class in a few minutes. Thirsty more than hungry, Emily hurriedly downed a bottle of water and ate an apple, while Mom reminded her that she was running late for class. Emily had just been promoted to a trainee with the ballet company, and the rules were strict. If you missed just one class or were late…</p>

        <p class="card-text">&quot;Can we go to the mall tonight?&quot; Kelli asked. &quot;Sure, I guess.&quot; Meg replied, figuring anything was better than sitting around the house. Being a companion/tutor (babysitter?) was boring, but Meg needed the money. Grad School was expensive, and Kelli&#039;s parents paid better than anyone else she had worked for. Meg couldn&#039;t figure out why she really needed a companion. Kelli was a senior, she thought, and should have plenty of friends for companionship; although her small size fooled many into thinking she was younger. But hell, Meg thought, Kelli was a serious hottie. Good thing her parents didn&#039;t know of Meg&#039;s sexual preferences, she thought. And tonight Kelli looked pretty good, dressed in a pair of very tight…</p>

Not pee in the conventional average normal definition of the word. No, her urinations could easily take on superhuman characteristics in the early morning hours of dawn. The incessant endless splattering of her urine acted as an alarm clock for her two sisters and her mother still in their beds. Her characteristic interval pee–pause, pee and pause would drone on and on, until at last the very unrelenting unceasing nature of it would finally rouse the other three who would file into the bathroom shaking their heads.

We stopped and picked up some beer and a bottle of wine and arrived late in the afternoon.
When we arrived, I needed to pee but not very bad; I just had to squeeze my pee hole muscles a little tighter to keep from dribbling in my panties. Bill&#039;s sister lived alone in a 1–bedroom bungalow on the outskirts of town. She was…</p>

Jane had arrived suffering from a bladder complaint that left her with feeble control of her bladder and inclined toward having accidents. Her embarrassing state would be made worse if any sexual stimulation were indulged in; as it inevitably delayed the time it would take for the complaint to get better. Unfortunately, the medication that Jane was taking had a side effect that caused such vaginal irritation it drove Jane to near nymphomania.

It had all started innocently enough, Debbie and three of her postgrad classmates from Princeton had decided to go into the city that evening and hit the clubs. Debbie, Jennifer, Suzi and Shanique had ridden the train in earlier that evening, had a great dinner…</p>

        <p class="card-text">The MD80 touched down at LaGuardia airport, fifteen minutes late. Rebekah was, as usual, stuck in the back half of the plane in 20A, waiting with her body half in the aisle, half in the seats for the passengers in front of her to get off the arriving plane. The flight hadn&#039;t been too bad, a couple of hours in the air, no major problems. Rebekah wasn&#039;t terribly fond of flying, but nothing that a few drinks at the bar wouldn&#039;t help. After a few minutes of waiting, she got off the plane and walked up the airway to the gate area. She&#039;d been to NY before, but usually had driven; flying in was something new. She was surprised by how small the airport was compared to the one back home. It was good to be away, she…</p>

As Florence Galworth walked across the fields to Strechley Manor to attend Mrs. Millicent Blakley&#039;s &#039;at home&#039; morning, she wondered what was planned for this morning. Millicent Blakley was renowned locally for being slight unconventional, such as having &#039;at homes&#039; in the morning as well as the afternoon, but Florence considered that overall she was lucky to such an entertaining family as neighbors. Mrs. Blakley&#039;s two daughters, both comely blondes, were a renowned attraction for aspiring bachelors in the county, and Florence, who was slim and dark, and also a number of years older than the two sisters, was content to offer a more seriously minded…</p>

It had been a really lovely day. We&#039;d been camping for almost a week and Des and I were so close it was perfect! We shared everything, told each other everything – a magical relationship, in fact.
We&#039;d been together for about two years, and once – and only once – I&#039;d told him how I felt about getting desperate to pee. He&#039;d taken it well; excited even – but I&#039;ll tell that story another time!
There had been a couple of times on this camping trip when one or the other of us had been pretty desperate but we&#039;d always managed to reach a bathroom before disaster struck and on this particular night I was hot and ready for something to…</p>
