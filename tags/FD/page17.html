        <p class="card-text">It was graduation day and Ashley and her friends were all bouncing from one class to another saying one last good–bye to all their favorite teachers before they headed off into their unsure futures. Ashley was still unsure as to what she was going to do for her future, she was hoping on a scholarship to college because it was her only way in. Her family wasn&#039;t poor but with four other sisters her parents could not afford to send anyone to college, so she tried to do everything she could to get a scholarship, not really because she cared about her education but because she didn&#039;t want to miss out on the college life. She also looked forward to finally being able to get away from her sisters who were all more…</p>

Anyway, since I was a kid I&#039;ve always had the habit of only peeing at home when possible, so I developed pretty good bladder control. One day I was coming back from a trip with Jessica and Dave, two friends of mine. It was a five hour car trip so as we were coming close to a gas station Dave asked if we should stop to pee. That was after 4 hours of travelling. Jessica was in pretty bad need and Dave was also complaining but I said that I didn&#039;t feel the need.

        <p class="card-text">She Always Like to Wait Until the End
Helen had devoted her Saturday to watching all three parts of Peter Jackson&#039;s &quot;Lord of the Rings.&quot; I watched most of it with her, especially the third part of the trilogy. The fun began about an hour before the end of the film. Even though we were watching it at home and could pause the DVD at any time, Helen didn&#039;t like to take breaks during movies since, in her view, it killed the atmosphere.
She had been leaning her head on my shoulder for about half an hour when I noticed her rubbing her hand against her stomach. &quot;Eaten too much?&quot; I asked.
&quot;Ssshhh,&quot; she said suppressively, so I didn&#039;t think any more of it for a while. After another ten minutes or so, however, I…</p>

Part Two
The polished hardwood floor of the ballroom glistened; the lights from the chandeliers overhead were reflected in the varnish of the wood. Spacious, the room stretched from one end of the old mansion to the other, high ceilings adorned with artwork, sculptures embedded in the royal columns that supported the old roof. A long bar, covered in black velvet formed the right border of the room, in the back, a double doorway led to the hallway of the old mansion. Before the doorway, still in the ballroom, a small antique table with an old lamp on it and a set of ledgers…</p>

It was 6:30. &quot;Half an hour&#039;s walk to Mandy&#039;s,&quot; he thought, &quot;Just time for a shave, shower, and spruce up&quot; so he stripped off, shaved and showered, dried off and dressed. He glanced at his watch again. 7pm. Perfect. He put on his coat and set off for Mandy&#039;s house.
He arrived at Mandy&#039;s dead on 7:30 but he was surprised to see no cars in the driveway. He re–checked the invite. Yeah, it was definitely the right day and time, so he rang the doorbell. After a few moments Mandy appeared at the door but she sure wasn&#039;t dressed for a party. She had on an old white tee shirt and a pair of pink…</p>

The rain beat down remorselessly on the fly sheet of the tent while Helen tossed and turned in a vain attempt to get to sleep; but try as she might she could not get comfortable. Eventually, remembering something she had once read about the sleep–inducing qualities of the female orgasm, she gently lifted the hem of the long pink cotton T–shirt which had served her as a her night dress during her camping holiday with Andy, and slipped her hand down inside the front of her knickers.
They were the same dark blue knickers she had worn that day at Byron&#039;s Pool when Andy had caressed her, and fondled her, and…</p>

Alexandra was wearing her &quot;court clothes,&quot; a stylish dark gray business suit, skirt, jacket, and white blouse. She topped it off with a pair of pantyhose and very high heels. That morning, Alexandra felt the need to wear something to hold in her stomach. Over her pantyhose was a long leg, high–waist panty girdle. As the day wore on, her girdle seemed to get a lot tighter. She really wanted to go into the ladies room, and tear it off. At the same time, she really liked the way it made her look.

Sarah had found little to interest her, and wished now that she had done something different with her Saturday. True, she had found a few small items of lingerie in J. C. Penny, but not much else. She had consoled herself with lunch at an eatery on the top floor of the mall calling itself the Cottage Garden. It was pretentious and overpriced, but she did enjoy the lasagne and Caesar salad, accompanied by what the proprietors claimed was tea made the proper English way, Earl Grey in a large white tea pot, all to herself.
The highlight of the lunch had been when a handsome guy had asked to share her table. They had chatted, and Sarah had crossed…</p>

&quot;Mmmmmmhhheeewwwwwwwww. MMMMmmmmhheewwwwww. Mmmmmmhhh.&quot;
She moaned loudly, sounding like a wounded cat as she did so. Another bead of sweat rolled down her forehead, her bare legs clenched together, tightly, tensed, her pulse quickening, breathing rapid, eyes dilated, face twisted. Her left hand waved through dark brunette hair, tied up in a single ponytail that flopped against her back and then rapidly grasped her thigh, finger–nails biting clutching her skin. Her body twitched, she shivered. Goose bumps rose on her bare legs, the cool air chilling her. She struggled again, breath held tight, eyes widening as the pressure came again. Stinging. Pulsing. She twitched violently, the shrieking pain…</p>

        <p class="card-text">It&#039;s another down day at work, so I thought I&#039;d tell you another story about myself. I also thought it be fun if I told you how desperate I was while I&#039;m writing this. Now because I&#039;m at work I can&#039;t just write this whole thing out at once. Someone could come by and interrupt me, or something might come up. Usually when I write a story at work it takes most of the day. Right now it&#039;s 10am. I got here at 7am. Like all slow days it&#039;s tough to stay awake, and since I&#039;m new here I don&#039;t think it would be good for me to be found sleeping at my desk. So like everyone else to stay at least a little awake I&#039;ve been having lots of coffee. Well you might not consider 2 cups a lot, but it is for me. Add to this the 24oz…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Laura, an ambitious young woman, had decided to expand her skills by taking night classes at her local college to obtain a diploma in business studies, a qualification which would enable her to go after a more demanding and better–paid job than the tedious office assistant style stuff she was doing at present. Night classes took their toll, however. Starting at six p.m., she had very little time to get across town from work and rarely arrived in the classroom on time. She hated being late, and besides, her repeated late arrivals were beginning to irritate her tutor, Dr. Edwin White.
Laura was late again this evening because her idiot boss had insisted on having her finish redesigning the filing system, not…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Nancy was nothing much to look at. She was short and dumpy with freckles and glasses, and cascades of curly auburn hair tumbling down to her shoulders. She always wore her skirt about four inches above the knee, even though she plainly didn&#039;t have the legs for it; and her frumpy blouses and over–tailored jackets did absolutely nothing for her figure. But what she lacked in looks, she more than made up for in personality. She was bubbly, vivacious and fun– and about three or four years older than me.
Now, don&#039;t get me wrong: I have nothing against older women, and if the age gap had been the only thing that stood in the way of my successfully wooing her then I&#039;d have been after her like a shot. After all,…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Some people discover early on their proclivities towards watersports, but I came to mine when I was in college. I was on vacation in a resort town somewhere in the Pacific. I had just received my diving certification and was eager to get to it. Before I arrived I had booked several dives with a local company, and on the day of my &#039;discovery&#039; we were to make two dives, both along the reef wall. Of course I wouldn&#039;t be alone; five others had been booked in my group. By chance I knew three of them – Amy, Joan, and Mark – they were staying at my resort and we had talked and gotten to know each other two nights earlier in the lounge.
I sat alone on the deck of the dive boat, enjoying the 45–minute trip to the…</p>
