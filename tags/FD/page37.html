        <p class="card-text">Have you ever heard someone say they wouldn&#039;t wash the place where you kissed for a week? It&#039;s usually a jest. I&#039;ll never hear it again without a shiver. We met up with a couple from Swindon soon after returning to the boat one Friday evening. We asked them round for a drink after our custom when tied up next to another boat for the night.
The weather turned cool so we remained inside chatting and the conversation got round to wet matters because they asked about the line of damp clothing hanging by the fire. Our regular hold–it had degenerated into a mass spraying just as we settled down to the evening meal. You already know about May and me, how we have been in the watersports way for a few years together.…</p>

        <p class="card-text">My virtual experience of Jill was one of scented rainbows, fluid motion, an animal sensuality that transmitted forcefully even across the airwaves. She called herself Gypsy Goddess, and I her Gypsy King. The effervescent mind of this young Up–Easter would not be confined to the humdrum drudgery of rural central Florida, try as she might.
Nonetheless, I was largely unprepared for the flood of flaming femininity that accosted me, and I say accosted because I was almost immediately swept off–balance, when I first met her face to face.
The experience can only be described as slightly hallucinatory. Her youthful beauty stood much more profoundly in evidence than I had imagined from her conversation and pictures,…</p>

        <p class="card-text">If I had known Debbie longer–If we&#039;d really become lovers, or had any chance to start a real relationship–I would certainly have shared with her my one very personal sexual quirk. Most of the women I&#039;ve loved have learned, sooner or later, how desperately aroused I can become by a woman squirming with an urgent need to pee. Most of them have played with it at one time or another, holding a full bladder to see what effect it would have on me, and the best of my lovers have taken a positive delight in having such a simple way to reduce me to helpless, quivering desire. But Debbie did not know, and yet with her there was one summer&#039;s evening that will stay with me for the rest of my life.

A gorgeous brunette, her exotic tanned features contorted by a longing desperation that served only to enhance her natural beauty. Robbo felt his penis harden inside his jeans. There was nothing she could do now. A slight sigh and a faint look of shocked realization started to form on her face. Then the first trickle as her long held urine started to seep down the inside of her stocking clad legs from under her pristine white dress. There was no avoiding it now. She was wetting herself!

It was her first night in her aunt Jenny&#039;s incredibly big house, where she was going to spend the summer while working in the local bookshop before going back to school. She stared at the high ceiling, feeling the pressure in her bladder. Where was the bathroom, again? Tina decided to try to go back to sleep and wait until the morning.
When she awoke again she had dreamed of walking in the woods, finding a secluded place, lifting her skirt, and... She realized that she had nearly wet the bed. Clamping her hand to her crotch she tried to remember where to go to find a toilet. It…</p>

The last time I got together with my friend Carol, it was a chance meeting that had us both on my motorcycle in the mountains and finished with the best sex ever. Carol was determined that we would meet again, only on her turf next time...
Well, It so happened that I had to go on a trip to visit a relative and it put me just a few hours from where Carol was now living. I called her to let her know and she was really excited. She started to tell me all the things she was going to plan and I had to shut her up. I wanted to be surprised instead.
This time, I followed the directions to where Carol was going to be and…</p>

Sarah, John, Suzy, and I went to the tube station where we intended on catching the Piccadilly line to Covent Garden. Delays were typical and it seemed that the next train was at least 15 minutes away. While the others moaned, I was secretly thrilled. Sarah&#039;s beers would be settling in her bladder and we were not going near toilets for some time. After twenty long minutes we were finally on the train when my hunch started to come true. Out of nowhere she shouted, &quot;God I have to pee&quot; and then crossed her legs and laughed nervously. Usually when trains stop dead in tunnels I feel uncomfortable but this time I was totally aroused. What followed…</p>

Clare&#039;s alarm clock had failed to wake her in time to allow her normal exam routine of taking a shower, grabbing some breakfast, and reading through her revision notes. As a result her Mum had woken her at 8:30, with the exam due to start at 9 a.m. To make matters worse, it usually took twenty minutes on a good day for the car journey to school and students taking exams had been instructed to get to the exam hall 5 minutes before all exams.

        <p class="card-text">Each wet weekend May and I have three sessions. Friday there is the need to hydrate and that means establishing a level playing field. What with drinking tea and coffee as well as alcohol we often start off in a dehydrated condition so we play &#039;hold it&#039; to start with. If we meet in a public place its off to the pub and take in a pint or two of shandy followed by fresh orange. The task is then to reach the boat without losing any.
After eating, the next round is usually messy involving May finding interesting and unexpected ways to force me to put my clothing in the washing basket. Anticipating when she will do this has become one of my major tasks since she is cunning. Once she held until after the meal then…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Here&#039;s another letter from Robert and I but we&#039;ve tried to stick to what happened around the time of the &#039;floods&#039; at the end of 2000.
Robert&#039;s boat has been out of action for a while so we had our wet weekend at his house and you&#039;d be surprised how close it is to yours.
As usual I arrived at the station full to overflowing. Now I&#039;m not very good at geography and when Robert said to take the train to Dewsbury I thought it must be the station nearest to his house so it was a bit of a surprise when he said we had to go another half an hour by car.
He had borrowed a neighbor&#039;s car and so we had to keep it dry. I&#039;m all right in a train but the jiggling of a car plays havoc with my lower parts. I shuffled about…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Glory tossed and turned in the bed of her college dorm room. Trying to remain asleep was difficult when the noon sun shone harshly through her window, creating a beam formed by the dust in the air that glared directly into her eyes. It also didn&#039;t help that she had to pee so bad, but at the moment she was still too lazy to get up. It didn&#039;t take long before she couldn&#039;t stand it anymore, and she slowly, reluctantly, threw herself out of her sheets and clumsily stood on the soft rug. Orientating herself, she grew more aware of her urge.
&quot;Man, I gotta pee...&quot; she mumbled to herself as she stepped into a pair of pink fuzzy slippers.
She had to squeeze her legs together as she pulled her long red hair back into…</p>
