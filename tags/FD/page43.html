        <p class="card-text">A couple of weeks ago I headed out to a concert with some friends, of which once again included my sexy neighbor Casey. After Casey&#039;s wet incident on her birthday the two of us had gotten closer and even a bit sexual together one night while watching a movie. So the night of this concert rolls around and Casey and I were picked up by three of our friends, Ben, D.J., and Hillary. We all rode to the show in Ben&#039;s Tahoe truck. We got there plenty early because we always like to tailgate and have some drinks before heading in. 
The concert was being held at a nearby arena and traffic was already getting backed up when we got there. By the time we found a parking spot it was pretty far off from the arena.

        <p class="card-text">A few years ago I worked part–time as a bartender in a strip club. It was easy work, the money was good and the scenery was great. One Wednesday afternoon around 6:00 or so I was quietly tending bar when the owners of a little mom and pop company that supplied the machines for the bathrooms came in. Not only did they supply the condom and tampon machines; they also took care of the electric air fresheners in each bathroom. It was a good time for them to be there as the after work crowd had thinned and the evening crowd had not arrived yet. The bathrooms were right across from the bar and they had been in the women&#039;s bathroom for a few minutes when one of the employees came out and told me that they would be in…</p>

Laurie was a college student, a respectable girl with shoulder–length blonde hair and a perfect attendance record. Her friend Kitty was something else: she was a bit of a rebel who would rather be attending a party than a lecture. The girls were close friends since childhood, however, and were now roommates in their sorority. The night after the last of their final exams there was a big party at a friendly sorority house, and both girls were going. Under the light of a full moon Laurie drove her jeep through the fields on campus; the sorority houses were quite far from each other, so it was quite a drive. Kitty was fidgeting in the passenger&#039;s seat, and Laurie knew from experience…</p>

Episode 2 – Return of the Living Wet
Each time there was a party on campus, one of the sorority members had the duty to stay in the dorm to ensure security and to open the door for fellow members who came home. This night, the victim was Cathy, not exactly one of the more popular girls although she was quite attractive, but her general attitude and interest in sports (she was on the hockey team) made the other girls have doubts about her sexual preferences. Cathy woke up in the middle of the night. She was certain she had heard something: a loud sound, like someone banging on the plumbing. None of the other girls had come home yet, and although she always had a butch exterior…</p>

Back in the early 1980&#039;s I became involved with a sexy blonde girl named Mindy who was a former stripper. At the time we were both in our mid 20&#039;s. She was a big girl, not fat by any means but what most would call statuesque. About 150 lbs, 5&#039; 11&quot;, large pendulous tits, a nice round ass, and legs a mile long which she loved to show off with short mini–skirts. She turned heads wherever we went, both male and female.
The sex was hot from the start, and within a few months we were living together. She was quite open–minded sexually and we experimented with just about everything including pee fun. While this did not turn her…</p>

When Joni felt her bladder starting to fill as she sat at her desk working the report due to her boss before the end of the day, she considered taking a bathroom break, but was on a roll– and she wasn&#039;t really needing to go badly enough to warrant getting up and leaving her work.
Lunch had really dried out her mouth and made her rather thirsty so she downed the rest of her half full bottle of water and rolled a meter on her chair to refill it from the cooler in the hall outside her cubical. She drank a few sips from the refilled bottle and continued working.
About an hour&#039;s work later Joni&#039;s bladder was very full and she decided to finish off her paragraph…</p>

While my mom had really tried to get me dry, and eventually forbade me to use diapers, I had hardly moved to my first own apartment when I ran out to purchase large amounts of diapers and everything that was needed besides them. Since the day had been exhausting, I had gone to bed early and happily in diapers.

        <p class="card-text">We were watching two 3–year–old girls. It was a hot summer day so we (my friend and I) had each had three 22 OZ. cokes. About half an hour later I began to feel the urge to pee. I ignored it and figured we would be leaving soon. About 45 minutes later my urge was getting to a state of emergency so I figured we had better get going. I told the two girls it was time to go and they started crying and begging to stay. Marcy, my friend, said, &quot;Oh come on just let them play a bit more!&quot; I figured I&#039;d wait.
Another 20 minutes went by. I was in urgent need now of a place to pee. I knew that even if we left then with the walking speed of those kids we wouldn&#039;t be home for at least 30 minutes. It was a last resort, but…</p>

        <p class="card-text">A Few Good Stories While I Wait
So, I&#039;m sitting here on my day off doing absolutely nothing. Well, not nothing...I&#039;m listening to music and looking at dirty pictures on the Internet. A pastime I don&#039;t tell anyone about. I also have a very full bladder...another hobby I don&#039;t tell anyone about.
I am so wet right now that my pants are damp, although I haven&#039;t actually lost control yet. Really, I&#039;ve never gotten that far. Whether it&#039;s from fear, boredom, or intolerance to pain, I don&#039;t know, but I&#039;ve tried countless times. I always end up giving in and getting on the toilet. Maybe this time...
While I was living with John I discovered this odd (?) fetish of mine. He was telling me a story. It goes something…</p>

        <p class="card-text">It was Wednesday afternoon at St. Peter&#039;s Hospital. Operating theatre sister Fiona Jones was arranging schedules in her office when Mr. Redman, the senior Neuro–surgeon, who said he wanted to talk about a delicate matter, interrupted her. &quot;Next Monday,&quot; he began, &quot;I am to try out a new type of transplant operation which will bring a great deal of money to the hospital if it is successful. It will go on for a long time, although I cannot be sure how long but it will certainly be much longer than anything we are doing at the moment. We are getting into a completely unknown area and I have been thinking about ways to guard against anything going wrong. One of the precautions I want to take against nurses needing…</p>

        <p class="card-text">A few weeks ago, my class went to a factory for germs and such things in Vienna. We went there by bus, and the ride took about 3 hours. In the bus, I was sitting next to Anna, and with about 30 minutes left in the ride, I was beginning to catch first signs of growing desperation. First she was just sitting cross–legged, but soon she started to move them against each other and banging her knees. After a while, she started to look very distressed and I asked her if she was OK. She said: &quot;Yeah, I just have to go to the toilet real bad. I hope we get there soon.&quot; This really got my attention. She continued to wiggle her legs around, and it seemed that her need was growing, as when we where nearly there, she…</p>
