        <p class="card-text">Kiran shivered with excitement as she carried Jamie&#039;s soaked bed covers downstairs to the laundry room. She could feel the wet warmness on her arms and took care not to let the bundle dampen her t–shirt. Jamie was in the washroom getting cleaned up after peeing her bed and as her first act as Kiran&#039;s master, she had instructed her to put the wet laundry into the washing machine.Kiran inhaled deeply to enjoy the scent of her girlfriend&#039;s pee one last time before tossing the bundle in. She wondered what Jamie would have in store for her– she would certainly feel compelled to get payback after what had just happened. Her vagina tingled at the thought of being subjected to all of Jamie&#039;s sexual demands. She hoped…</p>

Day 1 Finally it was the first evening of the festival. Ann and Linda had enjoyed themselves all day at the main event and now it was time to go for the walking. They had eaten at Linda her house (the four girls only, like each year, the husbands were at the terrain helping out as volunteers like each year) and now they had changed into the walking clothes and were ready to go out. They were all wearing the black glistering leggings, a lose t–shirt over it and sneakers with sneaker socks. The mothers had agreed it was a comfortable walking outfit and had happily paid for the whole package. Like each year they had backpacks with…</p>

        <p class="card-text">I am nearly 40 now but over the years I have had many little, and sometimes not so little accidents in my knickers. Most women do in my experience, though few are keen to admit it! We all find, both as teenagers, and as we get older that laughing or coughing with a full bladder causes little leaks and damp knickers, as can waiting to long for the loo when desperate, especially if you have had children. In fact I think it must be more common to leak when bursting than it is to lose control completely. If I have to hang on for long time I often find my pants are damp and sometimes quite wet when I finally get to the loo, though rarely do I notice the leaks as they happen! Which reminds me of the time that I wet…</p>

        <p class="card-text">It all happened last summer as my former boyfriend and I were making a late night car journey, taking us home from the wedding of an old college friend. Dave had drawn the short straw over who should drink with the result that he had been restricted to soft drinks, something he had been most unhappy about. Not having that problem I had drunk freely all through the reception.
The result was that I fell fast asleep, more than slightly drunk almost as soon as we set off for home some 140 miles away– a slow journey at the best of times with many quite minor roads and few places to stop. Unbeknown to me Dave stopped to fill up with petrol and use the toilet after about an hour but didn&#039;t bother to wake me up to…</p>

I&#039;ve always been into being desperate, but have always had quite a strong bladder and the idea of actually wetting myself in public has always been a bit daunting. I don&#039;t know why, but recently, my bladder seems to have started to get weaker and I have been in a few uncomfortable situations.
The other day, I was leaving the office – I drink a lot of water at work, perhaps 3 pints, and coffee, perhaps 2 cups so I go to the toilet about 6 times in the working day – anyway, I didn?t think I needed a toilet stop before I left, so I casually walked down the stairs. It was about 6pm and I hadn&#039;t been to the toilet for a good few hours and I&#039;d drunk about a pint or so of water…</p>

Sharon dressed herself in tight jeans which showed off her perfectly shaped athletic ass and a tight pink t–shirt under a heavy winter coat.

        <p class="card-text">Our day at the sea had started with some drama, as the planned &#039;comfort stop&#039; on the journey to the coast had been arbitrarily cancelled, despite some teachers being in need of such a stop. While we had been able to hold out until our final destination, a closed pubic loo had only made our plight worse, and, I am ashamed to have to admit to this, I, and my companion teacher, Kathy, had both been forced to squat in public, or near public, and pee. I can only speak for myself, and say that it was a real emergency situation and it had been a case of &#039;anywhere is better than wetting my knickers? and from Kathy&#039;s behaviour, she had been in a similar state.

        <p class="card-text">By the time I&#039;d turned 20, I had experimented a little with being desperate to pee but hadn&#039;t really experienced any significant incidents because I was too shy to test it out.
I was single at the time and hadn&#039;t seen much action for a while and was feeling the frustration a little. I decided I would go out with the girls for a night at a few bars and see what happened, at this point not even thinking about my desperation fascination. We went for a few drinks at a friend?s house before getting the tube into London, and I made sure I peed before we left, more out of small bladder habit than any strong urge to go.
Alcohol for some reason works quicker on my bladder than the rest of me so by the time we got off…</p>

        <p class="card-text">A change of management policy in our office bought in the supposedly popular idea of casual dress permitted on Fridays, so whereas girls had been expected to wear skirts and look smart, we were now allowed to wear &#039;casual clothes&#039; i.e. jeans on a Friday. This, of course, became a sort of fashion competition among the girls, all trying to show off the most expensive and tightest jeans.
Since my boss disapproved of jeans, I had an excuse to avoid this, but, being a bit of a show–off, I tried to join in by buying a pair of black trousers, quite smart looking, in a thin and slightly stretch fabric. They fitted me &#039;perfectly,&#039; so much so that one rather catty comment was: &quot;Never mind the &#039;panty line&#039; showing,…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Turtle Island, October 1644
With only the feeble starlight, walking on the docks through the mist made Temperance nervous. Her pace kept accelerating, and soon it became even brisker than she thought possible. Cold was sending shivers down her spine but she knew she could not go faster without jeopardizing the poor balance alcohol induced. She passed by a man throwing up every ounce of liquid he had had in the night and her heart missed a beat when she twisted her ankle because of a slippery paving stone. Her squeaking out of surprise and pain was muffled by the mist but not enough. Four blokes she had not spotted at first were coming towards her with small shining blades in their hands, and dark brown rum in…</p>
