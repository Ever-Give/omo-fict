        <p class="card-text">This story is fiction, although it is based on a real event that was mentioned to me a few years ago by a friend of the main character– whose name has been changed. The final outcome actually happened, but the rest of the story I have made up to fit credibly around it, based on what seems likely from what details I was told, and from various experiences of my own.
&quot;Okay, well I&#039;ll see you on Friday night,&quot; Kylie said to Dale, her new boyfriend. They gave each other a quick kiss then left the small inner–city park where they&#039;d met for lunch. Dale had to go back to work, but the rest of the afternoon was Kylie&#039;s to spend as she wished, as she had only casual work, and there would be no more for her for the rest…</p>

        <p class="card-text">This story is about a true experience from the past.
Many years ago I had a girlfriend, she was starting her first job at the age of 18, she was petite and pretty with a great figure, a bit like the singer &#039;Paula Abdul&#039; who was well known at this time.
Mandy (not her real name) was to begin work at a large office in the west end of the city, she started at 9:00 am and was introduced to her desk, she was to man the switchboard, after an hour of tutoring she was familiar with the desk and confident to work on her own. It was a warm August day and she was glad she chose her loose white blouse and pleated above the knee skirt, bare legs with white mid heel sandals.
Before she knew it, it was 12:30 and her…</p>

        <p class="card-text">I have a friend, Jessica, who has quite a weak bladder and often cannot even wait 5 or 6 hours without a pee. My super pee marathon encouraged her to try a normal pee marathon and go 26.2 hours without a pee. I was out of town at the time, but Jessica recounted the entire experience for me:
Well I knew I usually had to pee worst in the morning, so I decided on a three–day weekend I would get up at 7:55 AM on Sunday and go for my morning pee. Using the assumption that I&#039;d be done by 8, (with getting out of bed taking two or three minutes) I figured I&#039;d go the day and be able to have my next morning pee at 10:12 AM the next day, exactly 26.2 hours later. I told my neighbor that I needed to wash some clothes and…</p>

        <p class="card-text">When I first met Gill, it was a mutual attraction. She was an attractive blond, quite tall and at the time innocent, or so I thought. We were soon beyond just kissing and cuddling and starting to become more adventurous. But even in those early days there was a hint of things to come, but I was slow to recognize it.
She had a lovely body (still has) and I enjoyed looking at it and playing with it, as she did mine. I should have taken more notice of something that happened every time we indulged in mutual masturbation.
Either she went to the bathroom first, or wanted to when she was near to climax, but put it off till after we had cum and then sprinted for the toilet. At that time our activities where…</p>

Flying the versatile F/A–18D Hornet, they could strike any target from tanks to ships to aircraft. The Squadron Leader was Andrea, a Navy Commander. Newly formed, they got their first assignment at sea, to a Nimitz–class carrier.
All but one of the ten squadron members flew out to the carrier on schedule. One of the aircraft had serious mechanical problems, and the pilot, Denise, had to stay behind while it was repaired, since there were no spare aircraft available. By the time it was finally fixed the carrier was halfway to its patrol station. Denise had to fly out to meet it, traveling several hours over the ocean. The…</p>

Windows into the classrooms had curtains on them so the class had the option of closing them for privacy. 304 had the curtains open, the room was still mostly empty, only a few students had gathered to sit down.

Her car was in the repair shop, so she had to take the bus for an hour trip, plus a long walk from there to reach her friends.
She got up in the morning, took a shower, and did all the other things a normal person would do. She got dressed in a light blue top with a black mini skirt. She used the restroom, and then consumed some coffee before leaving. It was a 10–minute walk to the nearest…</p>

I met this girl named Kate about a year ago. We were both 25 at the time and we have been dating since. Things were going well for us. But recently Kate began having this problem...
&quot;Kate, Why is the bed wet?&quot; I asked as I woke her up from a sleep.
&quot;WHAT?&quot; Kate yelled as she sat right up in bed. &quot;Oh my god! I ... I wet the bed!&quot; Kate was sitting in a large puddle in the bed. The sheets were wet enough that you could see liquid being squeezed out of the fabric as she moved. I woke because I felt the wetness seep over to my side of the bed and found my pajamas wet as well. Kate had a sheer panic look on her face and tears were forming in her eyes.
&quot;Shhh ... Kate it&#039;s ok, accidents…</p>

        <p class="card-text">22–year–old Amy walked out of history class with her 19–year–old friend Jordan. They both knew they turned heads as the guys looked at Amy&#039;s fine figure in her tight blue jeans and crop top with her brunette hair tied up in a bun and Jordan in her short miniskirt and tank top, her shiny red hair reaching down to her shoulder blades.
&quot;Ha, those guys always trip over their shoelaces every time we walk out of a room,&quot; Jordan said. &quot;How the hell are we single?&quot;
&quot;Oh, speaking of guys,&quot; Amy said, &quot;I&#039;m having a little get together tonight in my dorm room.&quot;
&quot;But it&#039;s Friday! We should, like, be going barhopping and getting drunk and shit!&quot;
&quot;You can go ahead and do that if you want, hell, I&#039;ll take two guys to…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Kandra put both of her hands onto the rails of the lifeguard chair and lifted her body up into a standing position, her bare feet curled onto the rungs of the chair below. She arched her back to stretch and she tilted her head back, her long straight blond hair flowing straight down, shimmering in the remaining rays of late afternoon sunlight that shone through the large plate glass windows of the indoor pool. She looked like the letter &quot;C,&quot; her athletic body arched as she paused in the position, working the kinks out of her back after sitting for so long. Her red official lifeguard one piece bathing suit fit tightly against her slightly tanned body, her toned abs taut underneath the red fabric, her legs…</p>

        <p class="card-text">&quot;Hanna Evans, come on down!&quot; exclaimed the familiar voice. After more than two years of trying to get tickets, design a costume and the ordeal of auditions, the cute young housewife in the pigtails and the schoolgirl plaid skirt had often thought this moment would never come. Her white blouse and short, very short, skirt really accented her youthful figure. Hanna leapt to her feet and made her way to the stage, her plaid skirt flying, revealing glimpses of white cotton panty as she took steps two at a time. The camera operator, used to all manner of spectacle at the show, was distracted in spite of his experience and drew in close as Hanna&#039;s panties again made an appearance. &quot;Sweet, sweet, sweet!&quot; he spoke…</p>

        <p class="card-text">In my school days, when I was young I can remember an amazing desperation accident by one of my schoolteachers. I will not mention the school and I will call her Ms. Shirley C_ to keep her name secret. Ms. C_ was in her mid twenties when this event happened and looking back at old class photos now, she was extremely attractive.
Ms. C_ always wore nice flowing knee high hemmed skirts and when we were all sitting on the classroom mat she would squat down in front of us to talk.
This would always get the attention of all the boys, myself included, because Ms. C_ would sometimes forget to tuck her skirt behind her knees and we would get a free peepshow of her underwear. After that we were left talking about what…</p>
