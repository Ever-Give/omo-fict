        <p class="card-text">Margaret shifted her weight, a carefully neutral expression on her face. She tugged at my sleeve and I leaned towards her, feeling the heat of her breath on my ear as she hissed quietly, &quot;Let&#039;s get out of here. I&#039;m not gonna make it if this queue keeps stalling like this.&quot;
I nodded. The queue to the loos was truly impressive; people in various stages of discomfort were watching their places like hawks to ensure a few minutes of privacy in the smelly bluish interior of a porta–potty. Marge and I lined up ten minutes ago and we still were too far from the plastic grails, and when I say &quot;we,&quot; I mean my wife, because I for one hadn&#039;t been drinking ale.

        <p class="card-text">My First (and best ever) Experience
My name is Julia. Though I&#039;m still in high school, since I&#039;m now 18, I feel liberated, in that now I can share my experiences with others. This story is about my first experience, when I first learned that peeing and watching others pee was such a turn–on for me.
Though I like boys, I like peeing with other girls more than anything else in the world, and in that aspect, I guess I&#039;m somewhat of a bisexual. This story is told in the third person. I chose to write it this way so that I could include every event that took place, since I wasn&#039;t in the same room as some of the other girls when they peed.
Chloe, Claire, Julia, Ashley and Dani were all going over to Eliza&#039;s house…</p>

I have been living in Portland, Oregon for some time now and I like to go out and have a drink at a bar called Thatcher&#039;s. I have never known where the restroom is and as I particularly don&#039;t like to use the toilet anyway I have never asked.
Well one day I left home and caught a bus. I stood out at that bus stop for what seemed forever when I began to realize I needed to go pee. I was meeting someone at Thatcher&#039;s and didn&#039;t want to be late so I decided to wait until I got to the bar and hopefully would find a quiet corner to pee in. As the bus came down the hill I was dancing back and forth trying…</p>

One day, 19–year–old Allie was sitting home alone in the summer time, just hanging out in her short denim skirt and pink camisole (and if you were looking up her skirt you would see her dark blue cotton bikini panties.) She sat there on the couch bored, watching TV and sipping at her Coke. She was quite a naughty and promiscuous girl, and got anyone she wanted when she wanted them...it wasn&#039;t too hard for her; all she had to do was throw her long, brunette hair over her shoulder and smile her shiny lips at somebody, show off her perfect white teeth with the glitter in her brown eyes and she had them.

What is true is that I am twenty and The Diet really has taken off at my office causing some pretty interesting events – well it&#039;s of interest to me anyway. While I am heterosexual something about seeing someone (regardless of gender) desperate to pee makes me crazy.
Anyway, at the office there is this girl Hannah who is very pretty but not exactly a rocket scientist and is kind of full of herself. The truth is that I doubt we&#039;d talk if we didn&#039;t go to the same gym. She came over to me the other week and casually asked me if I thought The Diet made me better at holding it.

It was a hot day, hot even for the south of Spain, and the three girls were all feeling the heat. The three girls in question are Courtney – a brunette of around 5&#039;8&quot;, Hannah – a blonde with an inch of height on Courtney, and Tiffany – another darker brunette of around 5&#039;6&quot;. All three girls were slim and fairly lightly built. The three girls had gone to secondary school together, and having just finished sixth form, were enjoying their summer before they went away to university. They started with a trip to Spain – they were to spend several weeks in the country, joining various tour groups and being shown the sights.
On this particularly hot day, the girls were being shown around a museum.…</p>

That time, while she was peeing her clothes sitting on the toilet, she would&#039;ve sworn that Alyssa was touching herself. But as the days passed by, she began to discard that idea, thinking that it was only her imagination, until something happened that reminded her of those suspicions.
Yesterday they were alone at their mother&#039;s house playing cards, drinking tea and eating crackers. Once during the game Elizabeth felt the need to pee, but she ignored it because the game was getting interesting, and later the urge passed. When the game was over, they took the…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Once upon a time there was a princess named Ella who had just turned 18. She was allowed to move out at age 18 so she found a nice castle thousands of miles away from the King and Queen and decided to move there. After getting settled into the castle, Ella realized that she would need some servants. She had also always wanted some personal companions who would keep her company and who would be her friends if she so wanted them to. So she looked through the phone book to find what she was looking for. She came upon a rather odd listing. There was a picture of four women in their 20&#039;s who were offering to come live with someone and attend to their every need, including just being a companion or best friend if so…</p>

Laura wondered how she was going to support her apparently heavy backpack for hours, the straps directly rubbing on her skin. The jeans were apparently old, since the zipper didn&#039;t close all the way, making the jeans bulge out a bit below the beltline.

        <p class="card-text">Oh no, I woke up too late!
Glanced at the clock, quarter past eight
I hurried into my pink panties and short skirt
Covered up my C cup titties with a tight shirt
Grabbed a quick bite and drink
Already need to pee, but no time to I think
I rush quickly out the door
Already getting desperate for sure
I made it to the bus stop just in time
Got another soda, this one lemon &amp; lime
I let my blonde hair fall down
So beautiful all the other girls cried and frowned
I felt my bladder start to fill up
Hoping I could make it to my bus stop
So thirsty I had to drink another one
Crossing my legs now, this should be fun
Wriggling my legs while sitting on the bus
Hoping to not wet myself and make a fuss
I…</p>

        <p class="card-text">It was my first day as a receptionist. I looked at myself in the mirror. I wore a nice purple wool skirt, nice and tight to just above my knees then flared out a bit to just below my knee, a tight purple sweater that flattered my figure, underneath, a white satin lace–trimmed slip, sheer control top pantyhose, and matching lace–trimmed purple satin panties and bra. Everything was nice and tight, just like I liked it. I especially enjoyed the feel of my tight panties, pressing in my clitoral hood and the feel of the satin against my labia was delicious.
I drank another glass of water before leaving....

        <p class="card-text">Victoria Gray smoothed down the skirt of her Armani dress, anxious that it should not wrinkle. She wanted to look every bit the $500 it had cost. It looked marvellous on her tall, willowy form, and she knew it. The choice made specifically for her performance evaluation that afternoon, looked smart, professional, and elegant, a garment to suit board members from the highly conservative to the outright lascivious.
Victoria knew she was a hot contender for promotion to Assistant Regional Director of Highline Apparel, probably the fastest growing quality fashion chain on the east coast. She needed to look the part if she was going to go places within the company.

        <p class="card-text">I was driving home from the office. I was alone in the car, and suddenly the traffic slowed and came to an abrupt halt. For the next half hour we started, crawled, and stopped, covering about half a mile. Up ahead there was a bus stop and about twenty folk waiting. I glanced in the mirrors and could see no bus behind me. I felt sorry for them because I guessed they&#039;d got a fair wait ahead of them. As I looked at them I noticed one, a dark haired lady in her twenties jogging up and down. Suddenly her hand went between her legs and she bent forwards at the waist, bending her knees. Slowly she straightened up and seemed to regain control, but then she went into a pee dance, hopping rapidly from one foot to the…</p>

        <p class="card-text">The other day I was at the public park when I saw two girls in their twenties showing clear signals of being desperate to pee. That&#039;s not unusual here. During these beautiful warm days women go out to enjoy the sun, and since it&#039;s hot outside they drink a lot of water that ends up in their bladders. Since there are just a few public toilets around, it&#039;s usual to see girls in different stages of desperation, or squatting behind a tree or a bush, or even once in a while peeing themselves, just a little or completely, while waiting in line for the toilet.
What&#039;s odd about these two is to see them so desperate this early, when it&#039;s not even noon. Usually the best sightings are in the afternoon, after lunch,…</p>
