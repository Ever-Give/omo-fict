One day I had to go to a business meeting in another town. For this meeting one of my female co–workers had to go with me. This co–worker was a close friend of mine; I&#039;ll call her Amy. Amy and I were kidding around a lot of the time, and my boss tried to let us work together as little as possible, for we wouldn&#039;t do much at all if we were together all the time. We were however, the best people in the business and we had to close this deal. At work we had the joy of working with a lot of people, so they were sad to see us go. We were going to go away for at least a month.
One day we were going to a meeting and she said she had…</p>

Laura was sitting in the folding chair, filming Gillian as she was holding Marianne and felt her body quiver with lust and expectation, but also with the urgent need to pee. They had been hiking almost two hours now, and the nice pee break behind the picturesque chapel had been before they started. Laura felt the three litres of water she had drunk in the meantime filling her bladder to full capacity. She was on the verge of letting go; she wanted to pee right in the chair she sat in. Thinking about this she realized Marianne could look right up her crotch since she wasn&#039;t…</p>

I had made an unplanned visit to Aunt May, in the Midlands, but she was away for the weekend and Jilly and Jenny from across the street were house sitting. After discovering they were playing &#039;how long can we hold it&#039; we had a very enjoyable evening, and I agreed to stay the night and start the day off with them on equal footings.
We got up the next morning, peed and showered together. We had great fun with squeals of delight as we soaped and lathered each other. I paid particular attention to making sure that both Jilly&#039;s and Jenny&#039;s firm breasts were spotlessly clean and also that every millimetre of their pussies was…</p>

Michelle: &quot;Wait a minute girls, I have to pee, can&#039;t hold it anymore.&quot;
Elizabeth guesses that her sister is going to go behind the bushes, or even pull down her jeans and panties to squat right there, but gets surprised seeing Michelle just standing still and closing her eyes. From where she stands she can&#039;t see anything unusual, but now she&#039;s looking at her from behind and sees two lines of wetness starting to form down her sister&#039;s legs as a wet stain grows in her ass.

She had met Bernard–Henri on holiday the previous summer, and they had fallen madly in love. But he lived in Paris, and she lived in London. They both had demanding jobs, and neither was prepared to give up their career in order to be together. So it had been a long–distance relationship. Passionate phone–calls, highly explicit e–mails and whenever they could afford it, a day, a weekend or a short holiday together. Now that the Eurostar took only a little over two hours…</p>

        <p class="card-text">I met Emily at a trade–union meeting connected to the company we both worked for. I really liked her and I asked her out to dinner. We went to a very nice restaurant I knew in central London, not too expensive but excellent food. We got on really well; we were clearly on the same wavelength. I had great hopes this might go further.
As we were preparing to pay the bill, Emily looked at me and said: &quot;Shall I go to the Ladies&#039; here, or hang on till I get home?&quot; I was rather taken aback; I wasn&#039;t used to young women asking such intimate questions. Rather facetiously I mumbled something about not having the necessary information to give an answer.

And in exactly 42 hours, Parker was leaving himself, off to a rather distant school.

Carrie and Brad were a happy couple in their late twenties, their strong marriage made stronger by a great sex life.
Carrie was slim and fit; she&#039;d been a swimmer in school. She was small–breasted with a tight butt and gorgeous natural blonde hair. Brad was taller and more substantial, oftentimes looming over her, but she was the more forceful personality; Brad was a gentle soul, but with a mischievous streak.
Carrie was not terribly pee–shy; she&#039;d grown up with three brothers, and when they&#039;d been small they&#039;d routinely peed in front of each other. So Carrie was never overly concerned about anyone seeing her…</p>

Being into desperation gives me the advantage of not genuinely being caught short too often. But today I overlooked the effect of &quot;breaking the seal&quot;. I previously thought that this only happened with beer but learned the…</p>

Unfortunately for her she was stuck in a massive traffic jam with her boyfriend and wasn&#039;t going anywhere for a while. She thought back to what she had drunk that day and wondered how she had held out so long. It had started with a cup of coffee at 6am as she dragged herself out of bed. Another two cups as she went about her morning tasks, a pint of water to hydrate before her morning run and another one as she got back. Just before setting out she had gone to the loo but hadn&#039;t peed much. Now, two hours out of the house and caught in the worse traffic jam she had ever seen she gritted her…</p>

        <p class="card-text">True story
I arrived home from work on Friday, relaxed, ate dinner, and pondered what the evening would bring. Little did I know I would arrive home later that evening with hot chills and thinking whether or not my actions were good or bad. Perhaps even feeling a bit guilty...
Shortly after dinner my uncle, who lives down the road arrived down with a confused and pissed off look on his face. I knew he wanted something – why else would he be here, I thought. He explained the light fitting in his bathroom went, and the wires were melted. I wasn&#039;t really thinking anything at this stage, just annoyed that my peaceful evening was cut short. His fianc&#039;e was there, a petite woman in her early 30&#039;s. She was pretty.…</p>

        <p class="card-text">When her master unexpectedly visited Mei Ling, the Mandarin Tsu Ma, she was concerned to see her master so troubled.
&quot;Forgive my intrusion,&quot; she asked, &quot;but what has occurred that has cause you so much distress?&quot; For a concubine to ask such a question was to act far above her status, but she adored Tsu Ma, who had always been so kind and generous to her. Tsu Ma hesitated, then deciding that he could indeed trust Mei Ling, said, &quot;A round–eyed devil and his yellow haired consort have come to the court, asking; no demanding– that the Emperor allow them to begin trading with the Kingdom, and that they be allowed to convert our people to their barbarous ways. He is arrogant and demanding, and the Emperor hardly…</p>

When the band director asked his musicians if they knew anyone who could use a video camera well to film their practices and performances, Parker&#039;s name came up, and as such he was roped into being the band&#039;s AV guy. He didn&#039;t mind; it meant he could spend time with his band buddies, and while he wasn&#039;t getting paid, the band director always had free food for him, and that was pretty awesome. Plus, Parker was thinking about being a movie cameraman, or somehow work in films, so it was great experience. Last but not least, it meant he soon got the job of filming the…</p>

        <p class="card-text">It had been ages since I had visited my aunt in the Midlands and since I was in the area on a business trip I decided to drop in. Aunt May was always happy to put up anyone who dropped in, whether they were expected or not, so I decided to surprise her and turn up unannounced. I arrived about 7pm on Friday evening, knocked the door, walked in and shouted &quot;Hi!&quot;
I was a little surprised when a young female voice shouted back, &quot;Who&#039;s that?&quot; I walked into the lounge and saw that Jenny and Jilly were sitting on the sofa with no sign of Aunt May. Jenny and Jilly were identical twins that lived across the road from Aunt May. They were about 23 years old and were absolutely gorgeous. &quot;Oh, Hi Gord,&quot; said Jilly, &quot;Your…</p>
