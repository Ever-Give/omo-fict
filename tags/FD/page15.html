When I was eighteen, I spent four weeks in hospital after falling off a roof and breaking both arms, dislocating one and giving my back a nasty jolt. I spent quite a lot of this time with my arms encased in itchy plaster and suspended by wires to prevent me from moving them. I was lucky that my father had the kind of job that offered good medical cover, and I had a private room. To be honest, I would rather have been in one of the wards with other kids my age so that I would have had people to talk to, but since the insurance company was paying, my dad wanted me to have the best.
The hospital boasted some very…</p>

        <p class="card-text">This was the day of one of the biggest meetings in the history of the Bell–Thomas accounting firm. All of the big shots in the company were there to discuss a possible merger with Orion Corporate Investments. Of course, this also meant that meticulous minutes of all the meetings would have to be taken. Carrie Stevens was the best secretary in the firm and she was the first one called up for this most important of meetings. She had charged up for the meeting with a tall iced mocha and she also had some Coke to give her the occasional boost during the meeting.
An hour and a half had gone by and the discussion was really starting to intensify. However, Carrie&#039;s need to relieve her bladder was starting to become…</p>

        <p class="card-text">I had a really bad day at work and wanted a little evening fun; so I decided to play hold it.
I had 40 ounces of water 1.5 hours ago and a couple of vodka tonics since. I am now a girl who has got to go! I am going to hold it as long as I can and then measure my capacity. My record is 1.1L. I will try to beat it without wetting on my nice hardwood floors. If I don&#039;t make it, you will probably hear the splash, as I really let it out when I go.
Oohh my God, I am trying to hold it, but I want to pee. I refuse to loosen my belt or unbutton my jeans. Grown ups can hold it and I am a grown up, a 35 year old woman, director at a major corporation. I will not let the pulsing of my bladder control me.

        <p class="card-text">It was one of those beach parties where everyone just assumes you know everybody else, so nobody ever bothers introducing you to anybody; but in reality you&#039;ve scarcely met anyone before in your life. It was originally intended as a small old chums&#039; get–together; but then friends started getting invited, and then friends of friends, and before we knew it there were close on two hundred people having a great time, eating lots of great food, and drinking lots of great drink. Most folk had brought rather more than a bottle and there was plenty to go around; so I just went with the flow and made the most of the opportunity to chill and enjoy myself.

Her denim mini skirt was practically round her hips and Mark, sitting in the bus seat beside her with a protective arm around her shoulders, could have looked down and seen her knickers from crotch to waist had he wanted to. But he was too much of a gentleman, so he averted his eyes and tried to think of ways to help Trish hold on.
This was so not how Trish had wanted their first date to end. She had wanted to get to know Mark properly first, and then choose the right moment to tell him about her weak bladder and the problems it sometimes caused her. But now ... oh well, there was little point crying over spilt milk. She crossed her legs and clenched her thigh…</p>

Her roommates, with whom she had been good friends with since childhood, had all travelled back home for the holidays. Ramona would be left all alone in their vast apartment for three lonely weeks. On this particular day Ramona found her self parked in front of the television, reclining on the couch and enjoying her first real free time in months. Her peace was shortly interrupted by the twinge of nature calling her to empty her bladder. Ramona thought about getting up, but her favorite show was on. It could wait for now.

There was no obvious sign of a ladies&#039; room anywhere. She glanced at her watch, crossed her legs tightly, and leaned forward a little. Then she looked around the pub once again, studying the demeanour of her fellow drinkers. Two or three of them were taking a more or less obvious interest in her; and one of those, in particular, stood out. He was about six feet tall with a shock of unruly sun–bleached hair, a heavily tanned face and sparkling green eyes that seemed to smile at her encouragingly every time she looked in his direction.

Elizabeth: &quot;but Michelle, it wasn&#039;t THAT bad...&quot;
Alyssa: &quot;That&#039;s because you were wearing a skirt, so the damage was minimal, but we both ended up with soaking wet jeans.&quot;
Elizabeth: &quot;But you can&#039;t complain either, there was nobody in the street, so no…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Stephanie Winters crossed her legs and smoothed down the skirt of her red suit. Her greatest desire at that moment was not to smooth it down, however, but to pull it up and tear down her panties. Stephanie was bursting to pee.
She was prevented her from satisfying the urge to relieve herself by her responsibility to her company. As deputy CEO of Wiseman Electronics, it was incumbent upon her to show leadership and always appear in control of the situation. Having called the members of the Board together that afternoon to discuss the plans for a merger with Steinberg Chips and Circuits, or SCC, one of the fastest growing concerns on the east coast, she did not feel that she could leave the room and allow the…</p>

Doctor Annabel Hart. The pretty young redhead&#039;s green eyes sparkled as she stared in amazement at the shingle hanging outside her office. She had thought, more than once, that this day would never come. Still, she had persevered, working long hours to support her schooling and even longer hours to pass medical school. The sleepless nights and heavy schedule had granted Annabel her most intense desire, but at the price of any social life. In fact she had no friends outside the stodgy little medical school she had attended. She thought it was worth it. Social opportunities would come when she…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Nikki and Tyler had not had as much time to spend together as Nikki wanted. She had been working hard and had been tired after work and Tyler had had to work late many nights. So by the weekend Nikki was ready to close out the whole world and concentrate only on each other.
Friday night was a wash because Nikki and Tyler were so tired they just popped in a DVD and watched a movie until they fell asleep. However, Nikki woke up energetic and horny. Tyler was still sleeping when she climbed out of bed. She skipped her usual morning potty stop and held it until she stepped into the shower. She waited to turn on the water and stood there naked savoring her full bladder. She ran a finger between her vaginal lips…</p>

        <p class="card-text">We&#039;d moved from the shared house where Mrs X had danced so desperately outside the shared lavatory, (see Making her Wait – 1940&#039;s style) and therefore I never had another opportunity of making her wait to use it. Although many things were still rationed, such as meat, bread, butter and sweets, things slowly started to improve in the fifties (although not much) and we even spent the occasional day out, which meant using the generally rather primitive public conveniences at some time during the course of the day.
As a small boy, I quite often accompanied my mother into the ladies&#039; lavatories, waiting in line with her as she queued for a cubicle to become vacant. She always made sure she had an old penny in her…</p>
