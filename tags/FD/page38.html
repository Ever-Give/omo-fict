        <p class="card-text">I should first tell you a little about myself. I have always been into watching and listening in on my teachers&#039; toilet habits but I remember this one incident in particular. When I was around 18 we went in for a mock history exam. It was to last for two hours and was loosely based on World War I. So here we go into the class with the teacher, a woman in her early thirties with brown long curly hair, who always wore short skirts, tight blouses and sheer black tights. She was a big time object of desire for all the boys in school. I remember particularly sitting at the front of the class trying to get a peek up her skirt as she crossed her legs, but only once managed a quick glance. She was always trying to…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Chloe was an 18–year–old girl, who was studying for her A levels at a very strict school in England. She lived with her 3 older brothers who were very highly sexed and loved seeing girls bursting for a pee. They also lived with her parents who knew nothing of their sons&#039; peculiar pastime and were very prim and proper. They would think that the sight of an 18 year old wetting her pants was an absolute disgrace, and could not even imagine that anyone could &#039;get off&#039; on such a thing.
Well one Friday evening the brothers decided that it would be amazing to contrive a plan, working together to make Chloe absolutely desperate for a pee, and then ultimately wee in her knickers in public.

        <p class="card-text">Introduction
Some of the nurses at our local hospital recently held a coach outing to the coast, which was a journey of about two and a half hours. A good friend of mine was on the outing, and knowing my interest in the subject, she told me about the emergency stop on the way back. Even though nurses are reputed to have exceptionally big bladders, a number of them needed the loo desperately as they had been in a pub for some time before leaving. In fact her words were &quot;I have never seen so many desperate women trying to get into a small public loo, and from the time it took for us all to go, I doubt if any coach has ever held so much pee.&quot;
When I asked her for more details, she offered to do better than give…</p>

Loraine was the nursing sister who had organized the outing. In her late thirties, average height with a trim, rounded figure with short blonde hair she was the image of efficiency you would expect for a senior nurse. On the outing she had been wearing a rather short, tight–fitting fawn skirt.
&quot;Everything went really well all day until the last hour, when it was difficult to get some of the nurses out of the pub, and we were late leaving. The driver started complaining about having to work late, an attitude which annoyed me, so I rather abruptly told him that if he turned up in St Luke&#039;s A &amp; E needing treatment, he would expect us to work overtime if needed, so he could do the same for…</p>

While cruising around the canals of England I stopped for the night in rural Warwickshire and wandered back along the towpath for a mile or so to an eighteenth century pub for a pint or two. On the way back the urge to pee arrived which is never a problem either in the country or on a boat, there&#039;s hardly ever anyone around. Being a half decent sort of chap I hopped over a gate into a field of sheep and had just opened up when a voice shouted, &quot;There he is.&quot; I closed…</p>

The girls said &quot;Here comes 10&quot; because she looked like a 1 and I was short and round. She used to come by my house almost every day till we were 16 then she left school and got a job.

It all started with me reading a lot of erotic stories about hypnosis on http://www.literotica.com.
I was intrigued by the idea of it, and turned on as well. I knew that it did not work like that, no–one does anything he or she normally would not do under hypnosis, but I decided to try to learn hypnosis never the less. I went to the library of a university and lent some of the books. I read trough them and learned nothing new. No luck there, so I wanted to get a few more. This time I did not go the general university library, but to the one of the physiology department. I looked around and found a very old book about hypnosis. It was so old, and written in such old language that no one hat lent it…</p>

Red haired Carly, older (though not necessarily wiser) by five years, pooh–poohed the younger girl&#039;s fears, pointing out that the area was well lit; in fact probably better lit than the route they&#039;d have had to take through town.
So they ended up walking past the various collections of shops and stores. Carly was stopping at virtually every shop to look in the windows at what was on sale. Susy though, was…</p>

Twenty–five years ago, we lived in the same town and we were lovers and roommates at the time but it just wasn&#039;t right for a long–term relationship. We broke up and I never heard from her again. She was really wonderful; it was I who was the jerk.
Almost two years ago though, I found her on line as I was surfing some Internet site–– I couldn&#039;t believe it. We spent nearly a year getting caught up on the…</p>

        <p class="card-text">First though, we had other plans– a party to go to. Michelle called to say she had to babysit and would be an hour late. So, Julie and I went to the party, which took thirty minutes to drive to.
Upon arriving at the party, we were both thirsty so we drank three bottles of beer apiece, along with five cups of lemonade. Michelle finally arrived and she drank another four bottles of beer. We were there for a total of two hours before we left to embark upon our camping trip. Everyone needed to use the restroom but it was so messy that we decided not to use it. Then we left.
Julie, our driver, told us it would take an hour to get to the camping spot as long as there wasn&#039;t a traffic problem. That sounded fine, we…</p>

        <p class="card-text">When school started three weeks ago, something funny came up. We had a pep rally on Friday for the senior class that extended our school day an extra hour and a half. Normally we finish at three o&#039;clock but that day we had to stay until four thirty in the afternoon.
It started off like any other day with our teacher, Ms. Jorgenson drinking her two cups of coffee. That day we had her the entire day as our teacher. After finishing her coffee, she started to teach, and then went outside for more coffee. She filled a thermos with three more cups of coffee and brought it back to class to drink while teaching.
At lunchtime, we were forced to eat inside due to rain, though some of us left in cars to go home or to…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Since I&#039;m planning another trip into the Namibia and Kalahari deserts, and being mindful of the folk accompanying me, the story came flooding back (Ahem).... Here with a warning. This is looooong. It lacks serious erotic content. However, it&#039;s intended for the deeply romantic among us. For those adventurous souls who download it – I trust you enjoy it.
Some years ago, when I lived in a city called Johannesburg, I was in an outdoor shop buying some kit for a short trip into the sticks, when a small group of British tourists entered and were chatting about sunscreens, hats and the like. The group appeared to consist of two middle aged couples, a younger couple (the lass was such an attractive person with eyes…</p>
