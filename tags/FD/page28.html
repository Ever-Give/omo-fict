The Gang... everybody in school knew about the Gang, even the teachers, although there wasn&#039;t much they could do about them. Once or twice members of the Gang were hauled before the headmistress, but it didn&#039;t make any difference. The Gang was the ultimate bad girls, into everything that was forbidden, sleazy, or preferably both, and with a complete disregard for authority.
Tassja normally kept well clear, but this time she&#039;d seen them basically torturing their victim, and her conscience hadn&#039;t let her rest, though she knew it was a bad move to annoy them. For the next…</p>

        <p class="card-text">This fantasy was inspired by the recent postings on Wink 11.
It was a chilly autumn Saturday. Football season had ended two weeks ago, and the students from State U didn&#039;t have much to do. A gang of four senior girls decided to liven things up by having a beer–drinking contest.
Susan, a local, was what might be called the leader of their clique. Her companions were from different parts of the state. All were interested primarily in boys except for Sally, who secretly preferred girls. Sally and Gabriella were brunettes; Susan, a blonde and Theresa had auburn hair. They had the typical, budding physiques of young womanhood, average height and weight. Boys found them sexy in their tight jeans.
They lived in an…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Jennifer struggled against her bonds, but there was no escape. Sweating slightly from her excursions she lay there, panting and stared up from her living room floor. She was bored of doing dishes every day and had wanted more excitement in her life, so her husband suggested joining the local swingers club. She was intrigued, but she hadn&#039;t quite expected this. The meal had gone down great. She had cooked a grand feast for George her husband, and Tom and his wife Pat. There had been lots of wine on offer, which admittedly she had consumed quite heavily to calm her nerves.
Now her husband had whisked Pat up to the bedroom and Jennifer had been left handcuffed on the carpet. What&#039;s more she was beginning to wish…</p>

Her parents couldn&#039;t be prouder, and frankly, Sandy couldn&#039;t have been more pleased with herself for conquering her illness. Throughout the remainder of high school and the first two years of college, Sandy rarely missed any class on account of her bladder. There were still some days when her thirst would be too great and she would still need to leave occasionally, but those days were few and far between.

18F. The number and letter on the worn sign, high above the light in the parking lot. The cold December wind rattled the worn metal of the sign against the cold gray light pole. Lisa stared at the lines of cars, gray with soot and dirt, and then gazed at the mall off in the distance. Parking was difficult this time of year. A few weekends until Christmas, and everyone headed out for their holiday shopping, all intent on getting the latest toy or the latest fashion, cutting one another off, swearing at each other all in Christmas joy. True holiday fashion, she thought, people being mean to each other. She loved the idea of Christmas, but the nature of the holidays wore on her. Clutching her…</p>

The doorbell rang and I knew it was the UPS delivery I had been expecting. I opened the door and was greeted by a rather pleasant looking female delivery driver. She smiled at me in a slightly nervous sort of way and let out a bit of a groan as she set down the rather large box of parts I had ordered for my Alfa Romeo Spider. She straightened up and still seemed a bit fidgety, as she held out her electronic clipboard for my signature.
At this point, I took a better look at her. She was about 5&#039;7&quot;, with long dark hair and sunglasses on. Being the better part of August, it was already at least 80–degrees outside and she was wearing her &#039;standard issue&#039; brown short sleeve shirt and…</p>

Early in the evening we busied ourselves with making s&#039;mores and popcorn, watching a movie or two, and gossiping about all kinds of things that interest teenagers. After calling up a few of our friends to chat we were getting pretty tired. It was only ten o&#039; clock though, so we decided to stay up a while longer. &quot;Well, we can start pitching the tent,&quot; I told my friend.

His former patrol partner had pulled over a lady just last month for weaving in traffic. She had been about 28, pretty, and very drunk.

Vickie (a city girl) was still reluctant to bare her bottom to relieve herself even if she was to be covered by dense woodlands. As a matter of fact the denser the woods the more reluctant she was.
So, she was determined to make the entire six–hour trip without a bathroom break. She had never driven this far before so she wasn&#039;t quite sure what she was getting into. However, when she set out she was feeling good and…</p>

Sometime ago I wrote about my sightings of desperate women when I was working on a motorway service area.

The coaches were dropping their passengers at a small open space where several major roads met at the edge of the main, pedestrian, shopping area. This open space was crossed by several footpaths and underground pedestrian crossings (called subways in England), and had badly signposted public toilets. Since this open area, hardly…</p>

        <p class="card-text">The sun was setting majestically on the ocean, and the crowds on the beach had dispersed, but there were still quite a few sun–worshippers there. The beaches never emptied entirely on their island. Through her sunglasses, Rosemary looked up from her novel and admired the sunset. Another long, slow, beautiful day in paradise was coming to a close, and after nearly ten years she was finally beyond the too good to be true stage. It was true. She really lived here, and she really was a hero for the very reason she&#039;d been ostracized back home. She set the book down on her lap and pondered that thought once again.
Naturally, since she&#039;d stopped concentrating on the book, it wasn&#039;t long before Rosemary&#039;s attention…</p>

Jenny&#039;s first thought when she awoke was, I have to pee. The second was, &#039;Please don&#039;t stop fondling my pussy.&#039;
The significance of that second thought took some time to sink in. She was lying on her stomach with one leg drawn up, and a probing hand was stroking her from behind, parting her butt cheeks, sliding all the way up and down, catching her moisture, slipping inside her openings. But as she felt herself rise to orgasm she remembered. A small spurt of pee escaped her as she climaxed. She lay for a moment, just breathing. Then she felt arms embrace her and the pressure of breasts on her back. Slowly she turned and met Becky…</p>

It was a gorgeous day, simply no other way to put it. The sun was shining, the birds were singing, the air was warm and dry, with barely a cloud in the sky. It was the weekend, and the faire was the place to be! Games, rides, all sorts of fun! Everyone was there, including a girl named Amy. Amy was a darling, sweet girl. She was 5&#039;5, 110 pounds, dark just–below–shoulder–length brownish–black hair, beautiful smooth ivory skin, a face that had just the right…</p>

Sandy looked up from her cluttered desk and politely declined. &quot;Thank you Doreen, but I had better not.&quot; Truth be told, Sandy, along with the rest of the crew working on Senator Hazelwood&#039;s re–election campaign, could definitely use a caffeine jolt as the day continued past 5:00 into the young hours of the evening. With only a week remaining until the election and early polls showing a near dead–heat between the senator and his vivacious challenger, everyone at Hazelwood&#039;s camp was putting in heavy overtime. &quot;Are you sure?&quot; Doreen persisted. &quot;You look like you could really use one.&quot; Sandy sighed. &quot;Yeah, I probably could, but I don&#039;t like to drink caffeine later in the day.…</p>
