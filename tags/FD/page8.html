This story and the characters in it are fiction. Any resemblance to real people is purely coincidental.
Margaret, Maisie and Mandy were sisters. Margaret was the oldest aged 22, Maisie was 20, and Mandy was 19.
About 5 years ago, while she was in school, Maisie had taken part in a French Exchange visit, where she went to stay with a family near Lyons for two weeks, and then the daughter of the French family, Juliette, came to stay with them for two weeks. They had kept in touch, and Juliette, who was the same age as Maisie, was spending a fortnight&#039;s break with Maisie and her sisters. Of course, there…</p>

        <p class="card-text">I&#039;ve had quite a few boyfriends, but nothing very serious. With Paul I knew from the beginning it would be different. He was good–looking, intelligent, had similar interests to mine, but above all he was kind, thoughtful, considerate. I really felt this as going to be something special.
I like to take things slowly, and our first two dates ended with no more than a chaste kiss. On the third date we went to a movie, and then to the pub. Half way through our second pints he suggested, rather shyly, that I might like to come home with him. Although I tried not to show too much enthusiasm, I accepted straightaway – indeed, I should have been very disappointed if he hadn&#039;t asked. We finished our drinks, and Paul…</p>

When she wanted to go to the toilet in the bar Linda realised they were going to miss the last bus home if they didn&#039;t leave now. So they ran to the bus stop, jumped in and drove of. It was a 25–minute drive and she was getting more desperate each second. Though it felt she was going to have the urine pour out of her mouth soon she held on until the bus came to their stop. Linda also mentioned she had to pee badly but Ann knew she was worse. Linda had gone to the toilet…</p>

I had only just managed to jump on the tube before the doors shut, and I didn&#039;t need to go too badly then. Besides I thought I could use the loo here. The sign said the nearest public toilet was at Nightingale Road. I knew where that was, but, it was half a mile in the opposite direction from home. It was just getting dark and I should have been home at 5 o&#039;clock, it was now 5:15. Dammit! I would just have to hold it and walk the two miles home.
At 19 years old it seemed a bit much having to tell mum what time I would be home. But she worries, and it was only polite to tell her a time, I suppose. I had been sure…</p>

This is another real life experience from me :)
When I had finished cleaning up after my first accident, I was still pretty confused... I mean, I&#039;m not supposed to wet my pants when I&#039;m almost 20 years, how could such an odd thing be the best turn–on ever? I still haven&#039;t figured that one out, but I stopped bothering. It&#039;s the best feeling ever, I don&#039;t care if I can&#039;t explain it as long as I love it!
Anyway, I had two full days alone still, and it&#039;s not often I get the opportunity to be alone like this. Also, with school over for the week and no particular homework I needed to care about, I had nothing to do…</p>

Cindy quietly cursed each cup of coffee she had drunk on that cool, busy morning. It was almost 9 a.m. and the parade was about to begin. Her uncomfortably full bladder worried her. Could she hold on for the hour or more the parade would take before ending at a shopping center 2 miles away? 
&quot;Damn, damn, damn,&quot; she said under her breath while pressing her thighs together. &quot;And I don&#039;t even like coffee,&quot; she said ruefully.
The morning had not gone well. She had awakened at 5 a.m. with just four hours sleep after partying with friends the night before. She had a slight hangover and immediately gulped down a cup of coffee to get…</p>

Going on holiday to Cyprus was supposed to be so much fun! My friends, Alice and Barbara had talked me into the idea, but I had my doubts from the start.
&quot;Come on Janice, why don&#039;t you join us on holiday before we all go off to university! It will be great – promise you!&quot;
The first day was quite nice, exploring the coast, and lazing in the warm sun, but I found the evening hell! To be honest, I guess I was just not very good at mixing with people, and I really couldn&#039;t bear the idea of getting disgustingly drunk!
That first night we all three went into Paphos town and ended up at a big, noisy disco–bar…</p>

When I&#039;m feeling naughty though, I like to wait until the last possible minute to go to the loo. Most times I don&#039;t wet much, but I&#039;m often squirming and wriggling about trying not to pee myself, and doing the pee dance.

        <p class="card-text">Barbie was a great partner for lots of reasons, good sex being among them. In fact, she thoroughly enjoyed a variety of sexual experiences and positions.She thought nothing of parading naked in front of others and sometimes me. In fact, she was open and natural in everything except her bathroom habits, where she was a real prude.
&quot;Peeing is NOT a spectator sport,&quot; she&#039;d say emphatically as she closed the bathroom door. In several years of going together, I&#039;d never seen her on a toilet or squatting in the woods or anywhere else. Unlike other women I&#039;ve known, who thought nothing of squatting behind a bush or beside the car when nature called, Barbie always closed the bathroom door and managed to hold it…</p>

Note: This story contains Female Desperation, Accidental &amp; Deliberate Wetting, and Masturbation.
My first experience with pee fun was when I was younger. I woke up at about 7am and lay there for a while as it was Saturday and I didn&#039;t have to be anywhere. After 5 minutes I was hit with a sudden urge to pee that made me cross my legs together under the sheets; however the urge went away as quickly as it came and I fell asleep again.
I woke again half an hour later by an even bigger urge to pee as I had ignored the first one. Carefully but quickly I climbed out of bed but as I stood up some pee squirted out, enough to make a large coin sized patch on my panties. I managed to stop the flow and…</p>

        <p class="card-text">It was 7:15 in the morning and Gabrielle Baker was going to be late for class. She had forgotten to set her alarm clock the night before and awoke to the sound of her mother banging on her bedroom door. The high school senior barely had the time to grab her books, let alone do anything else before she had to be out the door. She had far too many absences this semester and was dangerously close to not graduating if she missed any more classes. In her haste she threw on a black baby doll tee that was lying on her floor with a black bikini top underneath. She quickly jumped into a pair of extra short denim shorts, while keeping on the white cotton panties she had worn to bed. Gabrielle grabbed her keys, slipped…</p>

        <p class="card-text">I had known Alice&#039;s secret for almost two weeks by now, and I still did not know what to do!
I was working in a PC repair shop as a summer holiday job. After doing any hardware repairs, we would regularly scan the PC&#039;s for viruses and other dodgy software. Of course, we found all sorts of other things on people&#039;s hard disks, but unless it was illegal, we never even mentioned it to the customer. Of course, if anything illegal had turned up, it would have gone straight to the police – but that left a lot of other interesting things!
This particular customer, called Alice, had brought her PC in because it was freezing every few minutes. Alice said her PC contained her university work, and she was quite…</p>
