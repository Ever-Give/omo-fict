        <p class="card-text">Jenny laid there listening to the alarm clock go off. She looked over at the time with her long blonde hair falling over her face...she couldn&#039;t believe it was ten after nine.
&#039;Oh well,&#039; she thought. &#039;I&#039;m already late for work anyways.&#039; She got up and felt the cool autumn breeze blow through the window against her smooth, built legs. She pulled off her sexy purple nightie and threw it on the floor. Going through her dresser, she pulled out a cute black thong with a pink smiley face that winked and said &quot;Don&#039;t You Wish&quot; across it. As she pulled it up, a blast of cold air came in through the window that made her shiver and she reached across and closed it. She then went into her closet and pulled on a denim…</p>

        <p class="card-text">It was still dark when Jenny woke a few hours later with a vague sense that something was wrong– very wrong. But she couldn&#039;t quite put her finger on what it was that was wrong. It was a sensation – a feeling – that was at once familiar and unfamiliar, but which she was sure she oughtn&#039;t to be feeling. Not here. Not now. But what was it?
She took a moment to consider her surroundings. What was the anomaly? She was in bed. Not her bed; a double bed. That was as it should be: she remembered Sam offering to let her stay for the night and showing her up to the large, inviting double bed.
There was a body asleep beside her in the bed. Jenny peeped under the bedclothes and saw the outline of two well proportioned…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Just for those of you that need a physical description to enjoy the stories here it is. I was going to just put a pic of my gf and me at the end of the story but then I changed my mind...sorry. Anyways, I&#039;m 5&#039;6, blond hair, hazel eyes, curvy with legs that just keep going forever ;) Lisa is 5&#039;3, black hair, and green/grey eyes, think mini Selma Hayek.
It&#039;s me again. I hope everyone enjoyed the last story. I had some more time to kill at work so I decided to write another one, or at least start one. Now there is another story I want to tell involving Lisa and me but I&#039;ll get to that one another time. Instead I&#039;ll go back to something that happened to me in high school.
Four friends and I went to see a movie.…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Tamara Stevens hurried through her day, running late as usual. The 5&#039; 8&quot; tall 18–year–old college freshman was having a difficult time adjusting to life away from home. When she found herself short of time, it was usually her toilet visit that was sacrificed. Her busy class schedule, dorm living and pet–sitting job combined to leave the beautiful, bright, big bodied, but bodacious busted bubble–butt brunette&#039;s bladder being badly bursting before bathroom break (whew!) each day. Her bladder capacity did grow to accommodate her schedule, however, and became less a problem. At first, Tamara would rush to the dorm after classes to relieve her tortured body of its treasure of liquid gold, but as her capacity grew…</p>

He looked at himself in the mirror and thought how ridiculous it must look for a 20 year old guy to be trick or treating, but his girlfriend, Melody, loved to do it every year, even though she&#039;s 21. And just as she was thinking about her, there she walked in, wearing her very appealing fairy outfit: shiny blue skirt with purple spandex on underneath (after all, it is cold outside!) and a white spaghetti strap top barely holding in her beautiful 34 Cs covered with a small, yet warm pink jacket in which her lovely blonde hair fell down to her breasts even though it was held back by a…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Lynn and Beth walked home from the club, through the warm July night. Lynn was a slender blonde with pale skin and straight hair, dressed in tight jeans and a white halter–top. Beth was shorter and rounder, with unruly brown hair to her shoulders. She wore tan pants and a flowery blouse. They were hot from dancing, and even Lynn&#039;s transparent features were slightly flushed as they walked. Feeling the buzz from beers and Bacardi Breezers, Lynn took Beth&#039;s hand and gave her a quick smile. Passing the mall they stopped to look in the windows. Lynn put her arm around Beth and pointed to a pair of jeans. –They would suit you.
— Think so?
— I&#039;ll bet your butt would look cute in them.
Beth smiled and wriggled her…</p>

Max is driving (it&#039;s his car) and Barbara is sitting beside him, while I&#039;m behind her and by my side is Michele. Well, &quot;travelling&quot; is really just an expression, because we left the Zoo an hour ago and we&#039;re still half way from home, stuck on the highway in the middle of a traffic jam. For Max and I it&#039;s just an inconvenience, but for the ladies it&#039;s much worse. They&#039;re both dying for a pee, and they can&#039;t do anything about it but try to hold on.
All of this started when we were at the Zoo. As it was a Monday on a holiday weekend and also…</p>

        <p class="card-text">A few weeks earlier I had played sick and stayed home to avoid an algebra test. It was now about 10:00 pm on a Wednesday, and I was in bed but couldn&#039;t sleep. I was covered in blankets and nice and warm, but not quite warm enough. I was mildly horny because of a movie I had watched before going to bed. I did not recognize the star actor, but he was hot. At one point in the movie he kissed a beautiful redhead. I must admit that during the kiss scene I was more watching the redhead than the star actor. I wished I were she. She is so hot, with such a nice body.
So there I was, lying in bed thinking of a dramatic love scene. It was just instinctive that I rub myself. I rubbed and rubbed, and got really close to…</p>

        <p class="card-text">20–year–old Shelly never could stand the sound of running water ever since she was a little girl. Even when she goes to the gas station she has to hold her crotch like a little girl because the faint sound of the gasoline running through the pump sends almost uncontrollable impulses to pee right through her. Even when she just gets done peeing, if she flushes the toilet she needs to go again; she also has to cross her beautiful legs very tightly to wash her hands.
And speaking of her beautiful legs, they look ever so sexy today. Nice and tan...you can look at them until her short baby blue fuzzy shorts don&#039;t allow you to look any more (and those shorts don&#039;t hide too much.) The shorts definitely showed off…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Lena put her bag down on the bench and looked around. It was her first time in this gym, but she would probably find her way around easily. After her divorce she had decided to start anew in a number of ways. She was thirty–two, with a very feminine, rounded body and wavy, unruly blonde hair often worn in a ragged ponytail. She looked great in tight Levi&#039;s and anything that revealed her cleavage. Pity the sad bastard of a husband didn&#039;t appreciate her shapes. She removed her pink halter–top and her black lace bra, needing the sports variety under the Lycra top to support her while exercising. She slipped out of her jeans – no, she had to wriggle – and put her black jazz pants on. With her towel around her…</p>

        <p class="card-text">A Chinese shop assistant provided me with one of the most interesting lunch hours of my life. I made a visit to Wendovers, a new clothing shop in the High Street to buy some new shirts. While I searched the racks for shirts in my size, and in my style, I overheard a conversation going on between two of the shop assistants. As I began to listen, my ears literally pricked up.
I had already noticed the Chinese girl when I came in. She was slim with long black hair, and dressed in typical working attire –– black heels, black pencil skirt and a white short–sleeved blouse. She was standing in an enclosed area where the tills were located, along with an older woman with a repellent perm and frumpy clothes.

        <p class="card-text">I wrote about our last experiment. We had great success chilling her bladder with an ice pack. Mary was intent on holding her bursting bladder much longer...she is usually so strong that way. She does it for me because it&#039;s the ultimate turn on for me. However, the ice pack on her pelvis broke her will in less that one minute.
So, I got to thinking about other ways to chill her. I wish we had a walk–in freezer, but we don&#039;t. I imagined using the freezer at the local pizza joint, but I knew the owner wouldn&#039;t appreciate the mess.
I thought about waiting until the cold weather returns, but that&#039;s months away.
All of a sudden, I knew the solution. We have a 2–quart enema bag hanging in the closet. We use it…</p>
