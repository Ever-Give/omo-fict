        <p class="card-text">I work in a real estate office and I get to meet and interact with all kinds of great folks. Having spent all my life in the retail business both working with and watching people, I&#039;ve learned how to feed my fetishes by setting up scenarios without the players knowing what&#039;s going on. I know it&#039;s devious but I can&#039;t help myself as they just sort of fall into the act. Sometimes this talent comes in handy when you have some of the fetishes we all seem to enjoy.
We often hold public open houses where we will open up a home and let the public tour it. It gives us the chance to meet new buyers and to help market a property we have listed. Sometimes those listed properties are new homes that have been built in…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Blair was grocery shopping for the big party she was having the next day. All she could think about as she walked down the aisles was the huge amount of fun she would have with all of her girlfriends. Unfortunately, she had gotten so caught up in everything she was doing at home that she had forgotten to go to the grocery store until the very last minute.
&quot;I hope I can manage to get there before it closes&quot; –she thought to herself.
It was still open, but it was only 20 minutes from closing time. As she hurriedly made her way down the aisles, she was distracted by something going on in the back room. It sounded like an employee was getting fired, or at least yelled at a whole lot. So she hid behind a display…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Forty–five years ago I had an Uncle Ron and an Auntie Pam. Except that they weren&#039;t really an aunt and uncle – Ron was a long–term work colleague of my father and they met socially outside the office. I had called them aunt and uncle since a small boy and they treated me like the nephew they didn&#039;t have, with gifts at Christmas and birthdays and chocolate eggs at Easter.
Uncle Ron and Auntie Pam seemed to be quite well off by 1950&#039;s standards and owned an Austin A35 – a very small motorcar that preceded the internationally famous &#039;mini&#039;. We lived in a flat (what might now be called an apartment) in London and several times a year my father and I would accompany them on trips to the country. My mother hated…</p>

A few years ago, I was on a bus traveling across Australia on my gap year. I was sitting right at the back in the window seat and a pretty, blonde girl was sitting on the opposite side. The desert had been rolling by for hours and I hadn&#039;t really taken much notice of her. But then I noticed she was beginning to fidget. She was trying to read a map, jiggling the whole time. After a minute she turned to me, leaned over the empty seats and said. &quot;Excuse me, do you know how much further we&#039;ve got to go?&quot;
I looked at my watch. &quot;About 2 hours.&quot;
She smiled and thanked me and sat back in her seat. But she couldn&#039;t sit still. She stared out of…</p>

        <p class="card-text">It was just my luck that the night before we where to do the shopping for our house party, there was the biggest snowfall for years. Then to make matters worse, the strong winds had caused the snow to drift. Although the snow ploughs had made the main roads passable, the remainder of the thoroughfares were blocked to cars, even off–road vehicles. Ian, my husband, had dug paths along with the neighbors, so people could walk. But the nearest town was 6 miles away.
After a lot of thought we decided on a plan of action, the nearest main road was one and a half miles across the fields. We decided to make a fun thing out of it and walk to the main road, then phone for a taxi.
Then all dressed up in sweaters, wind…</p>

        <p class="card-text">It was one of those days where I just felt randy, and it was about 4 in the afternoon. Time to get the mail. I went to the mailbox at my apartment complex, when I saw the prettiest girl walking along to the entrance door of my building. She was wearing a denim mini and a cute pink short sleeved shirt, so right away my mind began dancing with the idea of how lovely it would be to have a little of my kind of fun with her. As I thought of this, standing there at the mailbox, I let just a tiny dribble go in my pink boy cut panties, making sure none showed through my jeans.
I headed back to the apartment, and who was standing at the door to my neighbors but the pretty girl. She was kind of dancing about strangely …</p>

She is a proper lady of twenty–five, single, who keeps a friendly distance to her suitors at work.

Kristi woke up, her normal routine, on a Thursday morning. She took a shower, dressed up in a skirt (it was an unusually warm weather, reaching 90 degrees just south of San Francisco), took a drink, and took a quick pee before heading out. Working at a Sprint store, which was only half a mile walk through some redwood trees, she got there, avoiding the sun as much as she could since she was feeling hot. She headed there, did her usual work, answering phone calls and helping customers, and drank some water. Quickly feeling her bladder fill up from…</p>

But although I didn&#039;t really enjoy peeing my pants, I really liked the feeling of being desperate, so I decided to do it again.
About a month after the incident described above, I once again found myself needing the toilet during our first fifteen–minute break period, and denying myself that relief because I wanted to be desperate again.

Strangely enough, it was Carol who persuaded me to send in this next part. She read the first one after I told her it was going to be posted and wanted to read the rest of my impressions of that week.

        <p class="card-text">Tyler gazed around at the sparkling surface of the water of the crowded swimming pool. So many people seemed to have the same idea as him. It was a hot summer day, near the end of July and all of Tyler&#039;s buds had deserted him for their summer jobs. Bored and full of pent–up desires (solitary masturbation just isn&#039;t enough), Tyler donned a hot pair of swim trunks under his clothes, and headed over to the local pool. He was keen on all those dripping, scantily clothed females. Oh, how he envied the male lifeguards that worked there.
He scanned the edge of the pool, looking for a friendly face. Seeing no one he recognized, he then turned his focus to the vacant poolside lounge chairs. He finally spotted an empty…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Siobhan was a rugby fan, so when she was working in the English West–country she was a regular at the local club games. As a colored Australian girl with a flamboyant, if not provocative, style of dressing, she attracted plenty of attention, and it was not long before she had one of the players as a boyfriend. This got her free admission to the best seats in the ground and into the club bar, but her skin tight jeans or short skirts, coupled with her openly partisan support of Australia over England meant that she was not universally welcomed. The wives of some of the older and more conservative members were particularly disapproving; not that Siobhan cared one bit. She dismissed them as a bunch of fat–arsed,…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Penny turned her car off the motorway, headed for the center of town, and started looking for a hotel for the night. She was tired, hungry, and needed the bathroom. Still two hundred miles from home, she decided to rest rather than to risk an accident. She smiled to herself at the word accident; there were several kinds, not all of them unpleasant.
She parked, grabbed her bags and went to check in. Her tight jeans left little room for her full bladder, so she unbuttoned her top button to ease the pressure. Being this obvious was part of the thrill. She put her bags down at the counter and smiled at the receptionist, a young fair girl in beige pants and a white blouse.
— Do you have a room for me?
— Sure.…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Glancing at the elegant gold watch her parents had given her as a commencement gift (a newer car, she felt, would have been much more appreciated), Sandy was surprised to see that another hour had past. Looking up out the far window of the 17th floor, she was also not expecting night to have overtaken the day so quickly. Daylight savings time had been implemented only the previous weekend, and she, like most everyone else, was still adjusting. Honestly, the night did not appear much different from the just–ended day, which had been overrun with ominous clouds, destroying any chance of sunlight heating their quaint city beyond the freezing point. On a clear day, it was possible to see as far as 35 miles from…</p>
