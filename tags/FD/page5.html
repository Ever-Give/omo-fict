I&#039;m sure phone sex has been around since shortly after Alexander Graham Bell invented the telephone. Certainly the proliferation of cell phones has increased phone sex activity exponentially, making this popular past time available to billions of people almost anywhere and anytime. 
But what about phone wetting? The desperation of someone at the other end of the call, trying to hold it and bursting for a pee, can be almost as exciting as seeing your favorite woman pee her pants. In fact, phone wetting can be more exciting than phone sex. Whereas phone sex, of necessity, must be staged by the parties at both ends of the call–…</p>

Rachel threw the last of her papers and other items into her briefcase and muttered &quot;Thank fuck for that!&quot; This was swiftly followed by &quot;Ow! Shit!&quot; as, slamming the lid shut, she trapped the fleshy part of the heel of her hand between the lid and the base. She sucked the wound ruefully; although she hadn&#039;t drawn blood, she expected that there would be a blood blister there later. God, what a day it had been; what a week, in fact. It had been all about stress, pressure, with a liberal helping of frustration thrown in for good measure; she was glad it was finally over, for the weekend, at least. But who knew what…</p>

Vanessa and her partner Keiran, who lived in a remote English country village, often had a group of friends to stay for the weekend, and on Saturday night had arranged a visit to their favourite pub in a nearby village. A late–night bus connecting all the villages in the area had recently been started, and Vanessa insisted that they use this to come home, instead of driving or ordering a taxi. The pub was famous for both real ale and local cider, so they were all expecting to have plenty to drink.
Vanessa, a well–built girl in her 30&#039;s, was wearing a long, close fitting dress, which clearly showed the outline of her knickers. Kieran…</p>

Ever since my last accident, I&#039;d been thinking on how to best go about my next wetting. Every idea just seemed too bold for me. I liked what I felt to a certain extent, but most of my initial ideas would potentially put me in very socially dangerous situations. I kept arguing with myself in that regard, because it is entirely the point to feel that danger. The simple release is nothing without thought of losing it, the fear of utter humiliation.
That&#039;s when I came up with my plan. I wanted to pee in front of someone but have it not matter. I wanted to experience the urgency of a consequence to flooding my pants.…</p>

        <p class="card-text">As many of you will know from my earlier stories, a small bladder such as mine, and coach outings are not a happy combination, and since my early teaching days I have always been wary of school outings in coaches, which seem to have become an end of term tradition, despite all the changes in the education system. As a young teacher, my first school outing became a nightmare of absolute desperation, ending with wet knickers, that, luckily, I managed to keep hidden. My school is no different, and though we try to make some of the outings &#039;educational,&#039; others are purely for fun, and it was one of these fun outings that I volunteered to organise, not because I wanted the extra responsibility, or credit by giving…</p>

Tanja and I were together in Mexico. It still seemed so surreal even as I lay beside her in bed that first morning in a five star beachside resort. It was already getting quite warm even though it couldn&#039;t have been past 9:30. I considered getting up to turn on the AC before it got too hot, but didn&#039;t want to leave the comfortable bed just yet. Tanja was still sleeping beside me, completely nude. 
It had been a long but fun night. We had gotten drunk back in L.A., but not drunk enough to be restricted from flying. We had taken a cab to the airport, already desperate from the alcohol we had consumed. We…</p>

        <p class="card-text">You may have read a couple of our experiences already. Basically I have always had a thing about girls wetting themselves. I cross dress myself and when young, would often pretend to have accidents when dressed as a girl. I became my own ideal woman. All this was hidden well out of everyday sight as I grew up.
Eventually I met one or two girls who I was able to be more open with and began to have fun both sharing their clothes and with pee games. As I was not outwardly very masculine, girls used to assume I was gay and would confide all sorts of things to me. Strangely this gave me a great advantage and I certainly exploited these situations.

This is another real life experience from me, about what I did right after my previous story, &quot;The camouflaged wetting&quot; =)
I had tortured my bladder two times today already, and I didn&#039;t know how much more it could handle. After stepping out of the shower where I cleaned up after trying my camouflage kit out, I needed to pee really often, like every 30–40 minutes, even though it wasn&#039;t much. My bladder was very weak, but I still had the evening and night for further experiments. Now that I had found this new interest, I couldn&#039;t let any opportunity go to waste.

Ellen tried to remove her work shoes while she talked on the office phone, meanwhile ignoring her cell phone. It blared her alma mater&#039;s fight song and made her realize how annoying her ring tone could be. She knew the cell phone call was Stephen and that he was mad at her. She continued to ignore it and it finally stopped ringing, and then beeped that there was voice mail.
&quot;No use looking at that,&quot; she said to herself. She walked over to the window and looked down. Ten stories below she could see Stephen&#039;s red Mercedes idling at the curb in front of the building. She knew he was inside the car, fuming at her lateness.

My name is Daisy and I wet my pants last Sunday.
I have no idea when my fetish with wetting began, but ever since I was little, there&#039;s always been something magical about the desperate struggle with nature. My earliest memories of feeling attracted to someone were memories of helping a struggling friend make it to the restroom and watching her fail en route. With such a fetish for watching, I&#039;ve always been a careful soul in regards to my own bladder. I&#039;ve wet myself a couple of times as a little girl, but that&#039;s to be expected. In my middle school and high school years, I&#039;d never let myself get even remotely near the &quot;danger…</p>

The first seven weeks of my new job flew by. I was really busy with work, learning many of my tasks on the fly. I was glad that I had paid attention in school; I knew the basics of my job very well. However, there were still many aspects of my job that had been taught lightly or not at all. I worked hard to learn the ropes of the trade and complete my tasks as quickly and effectively as I could. My boss, Mr. Brokovich had been pleased with how well I was picking up things, but it was really all Tanja&#039;s doing. She was a great mentor, both in accounting–related matters and in love.
Before I knew it, it was Friday…</p>

When I was in my late teens, my local park had a boating lake, and Bill, the boatman used to let some of us help him and in return we would get free trips out on the rowing boats. There were several of us– including girl called Tracey, who was about 3 years younger than I. I found her quite attractive and often took the opportunity to share a rowing boat with her. 
One day we rowed into the centre of the lake and drew in the oars, allowing the boat to just drift. We chatted for a while, and soon found ourselves looking into each other&#039;s eyes. We kissed, gently at first but soon quite passionately. Tracey&#039;s hand strayed to my leg, just above…</p>

Things were going well between Tanja and me. I was madly in love with her and I could feel that she had a growing liking to me as well. We did have our differences though. I wanted nothing more than to be with Tanja all the time. She was absolutely amazing in every way. She was the woman I had only seen in my dreams until now.
However, Tanja was more non–committal and tended to shy away from any discussions of getting to know each other better. She seemed to want to keep her options open and rolled with life as it came, taking in all of each and every experience. I had told her that I was okay with…</p>

        <p class="card-text">My partner and I were invited to an Old Skool rave at a friend&#039;s house last weekend. She had not initially understood the invite fully. It was obvious to me but although Val&#039;s English is excellent, it is not her first language and there are subtle cultural differences, which had eluded her. I realised that it was going to be predominantly 90&#039;s music but it was also going to be fancy dress. We were expected to go in school uniform or at least something that would pass as that.
Val was quite surprised. She has never really got her head round this schoolgirl nightclub thing. She feels that there is something odd about young women dressing as provocative schoolgirls, especially as she says the English are so…</p>
