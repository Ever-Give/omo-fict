        <p class="card-text">We had intended to stop our stories, give up fantasies, become decent members of polite society but....
Its 3 o&#039;clock in the morning and I&#039;ve just been for a wee. As I creep back into bed, May mumbles in her sleep rolling over to deny me even the three inches of mattress she usually allows me. Carefully I clamber over her to take her side of the bunk. The duvet doesn&#039;t stretch to my new side because May has it all. Is it like this for everyone who sleeps with someone else?
She looks so sweet curled up comfortably that I haven&#039;t the heart to yank the cover over to me. My ploy is to slide very close to her and put my arms around her. When she&#039;s asleep all her actions are reflex. She mumbles again and returns…</p>

Uxbridge is some way from the center of London but it&#039;s on an underground line. When we stopped the boat there, it was convenient to have a day out in the big city. My &#039;social education&#039; started when Robert began to show me how I could dress to make better use of what he calls &quot;my graces.&quot; Then he forced me to meet all sorts of people who cruise around the canals. One of these was a professor in a London University college. We had decided to go to see him and his wife at their home in Muswell Hill.
As they are an eccentric couple, Robert suggested that dressing too elaborately might be unwise since you never knew what they would have arranged for…</p>

        <p class="card-text">There are nights in the deep South which seem to suit the human temperament to perfection. Visitors from other regions are frequently overwhelmed by the explosive profusion of vines and flowers covering every tree, bush, and lawn, providing not only a dazzling kaleidoscope of color but also filling the air with intoxicating scents. At night, when the whippoorwills keen their haunting refrain and the warm breeze rustles the branches and Spanish moss in the high, twisted oaks, the South can seem like a universe apart from the dirt and bustle of modern America.
I had been hired as a networking consultant at one of the most lavish country club settings in the South, far removed in distance, culture, and setting…</p>

        <p class="card-text">October 8, 2002 was a bitter day for our little software company. We had begun the firm almost as kids and soared to the heights of the tech boom not as millionaires, but amazingly affluent for young adults in our late 20s. Fortunately, we were a solid company with a good product. We didn&#039;t tank when the bubble burst, but we definitely were no longer looking at retirement in our 30s as we all had imagined.
What really stung, though, was when it became apparent that takeover by one of the larger telecom concerns was inevitable. The offer was reasonable, we had incurred minor debt, and there was no question our financial security depended on selling out to a more secure operation. We were coming out alright,…</p>

Tall and willowy with blonde hair that cascaded down her shoulders and a sweet, very white, sort of baby face and sparkling, crystal blue eyes, Robin was of German–American ancestry.
Shortly after we began our relationship, Robin boldly stated, &quot;My main desire sexually is to do precisely whatever pleases you.&quot; She was kind of a sub, but far from being passive, exhibited an extremely ebullient, outgoing personality. She cajoled me to somewhat reluctantly confess to my watersports affinity; the first time I had done so in my entire life.
&quot;Ohhh, I just know that&#039;s going to be my thing!&quot; she exclaimed. &quot;I pee all the time,…</p>

It is an afternoon class and at lunchtime Irene has consumed 2 large glasses of coke and 2 bottles of water.
The first sign that the day isn&#039;t going as planned is about 15 minutes into the afternoon class when the woman sitting next to Irene, Celia, put her hand up and said to the teacher, &quot;Please Miss Jones, Irene has just kicked me under the table.&quot;
Miss Jones looked angrily across to Irene and called her to the front of the class and said, &quot;Irene, I am going to make an example of you…</p>

Head tilted back, eyes tight shut; she worked her fingers in slow orgasmic circles as she gently peed. The wetness, the excitement, and then the lounge door swung open and Hannah let out a great gush into her knickers in surprise.
&quot;Kirsty you startled me,&quot; she complained to her grinning flat mate. Kirsty always liked to see her friend pleasure herself in front of some dirty watersports video.
&quot;What is it? Another pee movie?&quot; asked Kirsty. She peered at the screen and started to feel a bit concerned at Hannah&#039;s surprise choice of sexual stimulation.

        <p class="card-text">We married quite young; I was twenty–one and Tracy was twenty. I had admired her shapely body in the tight jeans for some time before things fell into place and we started dating. We got married within a year.
I first met her sister at the wedding. Lynn was eighteen with a slender body, usually dressed in tight, short dresses and skirts, or leggings and t–shirt. Tracy didn&#039;t mind me noticing her sister. Isn&#039;t she cute? She used to say, &quot;don&#039;t you just love her?&quot; Not as much as I love you, was my truthful answer.
The summer after the wedding we spent two weeks at Tracy&#039;s family&#039;s summerhouse by the sea. One day Lynn turned up unexpectedly. &quot;Time to check out the happy couple,&quot; she said. &quot;Still in love?&quot;

I had taken on the job of building a new terrace on my uncle&#039;s summer house, a combination vacation and summer job. Actually there were two uncles who had built only yards apart on my grandfather&#039;s land, part of the deal being that my mother got the apartment in the city. I hefted a crowbar and tried to look mean.

I turned. She was tiny, dark and beautiful, dressed in a blue micro–miniskirt and a skimpy top, sitting on the porch of the other house, looking expectantly at me.
— Deena?
She jumped up, came over and gave me a hug. –Terry!

        <p class="card-text">This is just a fun little incident that I love to think back to.
It had been after a long night of incredible (and I mean *incredible*) sex with my fianc&#039;. I woke up before he did, sat up in bed, and just watched him sleep. God, he was so gorgeous. Then, I felt the urge to pee. It wasn&#039;t too bad, just one of those morning pees. I was about to get up, but he woke up. We smiled at each other and I cuddled up next to him. He playfully started kissing me, but I was distracted because my urge to pee was getting stronger –– a LOT stronger. As he started to gently kiss down my stomach, I knew I had to go relieve myself. I think he saw my discomfort and figured out that I had to pee.
&quot;Baby, please...stop.&quot;
He…</p>

&quot;My troubles started when we were having a drink in the evening. I got into a stupid argument with Sharon, and we had a drinking contest, seeing who could drink a pint the fastest, and then immediately a rematch changing drinks, so I drank lager and Sharon bitter. (Sharon is a white girl who always seems to rub me up the wrong way. If I had not already been drinking I would have ignored her, like I usually do. It would have been much better if I had.) We had hardly finished that when Sister Loraine was telling us it was time to leave, and I just had to finish my drink before we left, so I had…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Patty looked at her watch and realized she had 10 minutes to catch her train. She could not finish the rest of her errands today, nor stop to find a ladies room. Her need to pee was not urgent, but she would rather not use the toilet on the train.
Although Patty was pushing 60, she did not look it and was very attractive. She has shoulder length dark hair and naturally tanned dark skin and small but perky eyes. Her looks are the hallmark of many of the well–off Jewish women in the New York area. Unlike many of these women however, she chose to start her own business and not live totally off her husband. Being an owner gave her some liberties, like today. Taking the entire day off to go to a Broadway Matinee.…</p>

        <p class="card-text">I&#039;m writing this first bit because Robert had to go on his least favorite outing to empty the toilet tank on our boat. We were trying some new ideas last weekend and one of them was a real corker. I&#039;m a bit awkward over some words so I hope you&#039;ll forgive me. The game went like this. First drink, we always prefer water, 2 pints, and 1200ml each in less than an hour. Next, go for a brisk walk to get the system working. Two hours after the first cup we are back and holding but not desperate. The third move is to place two chairs side by side and take precautions against flooding, such as thick towels or a plastic sheet on the floor.
Sitting on the chairs, the object is to help one another to hold on whilst we…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Over the past three years May and I have tried out as many variations of watersports as we could find the nerve for. The following represents our joint conclusions so far.
Many pleasures fade with repetition and we soon found that the things we enjoyed on our own no longer held the same satisfaction when we were together. Sitting at the computer with tight wet jeans or a nappy for example led on to masturbation when alone but together we just felt a trifle silly. Now neither of us continues with it.
Bedwetting was at first a great turn on but eventually it became a nuisance so we stopped that. A friendly human body becomes quite warm and damp enough when cuddled without the need to do excess washing each…</p>
