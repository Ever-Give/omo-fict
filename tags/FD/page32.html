Emily bounced down the college steps and out towards the car park. It had been a typically boring Friday and she was eager forget all about her Business Studies course and concentrate on the evening ahead. She was a little bit late out of school because she had changed out of her Sixth Form uniform in the Ladies&#039; toilets. Now she was wearing a light pink sleeveless tee shirt, tight black stretch–cotton skirt and strappy platforms. She&#039;d put on a little glitter spray too because they were going into town.

        <p class="card-text">It was 1960 when Vicky climbed aboard a Greyhound Bus affiliate that connected her hometown to the main line. It was the cheapest way for Vicky to get to Philadelphia where she had acquired a job writing copy for an advertising agency. It was a Friday morning and she had to report Monday morning at 8:00AM sharp. With the help of her parents she had already arranged for lodging in Philly and she had an advance in cash from her daddy to last until she got her feet on the ground. It was the best she could do with her recent Baccalaureate Degree in English and she was very excited about her prospects. She couldn&#039;t imagine a better starting point.

        <p class="card-text">Some time ago I had a temporary job trying to sell motoring services and products on a motorway service area. The marketing organization I was working for thought that motorists stopping for a break would be a soft target and a captive market. In fact it was a thankless and badly paid job, and most people soon became disheartened and left. I stayed longer than anyone, despite the miserable job, because a few of the people arriving at the service area were desperate for a pee, and this job paid me to stand around and watch for this. Below are the best of these sighting, collected over about six months, together with my thought on what I saw. All of these are true sightings, and I apologize in advance for the…</p>

        <p class="card-text">The Tappan Zee is a 3–Mile long bridge on the Hudson River north of New York City. The traffic is always backed up and since there is no way off, I have often imagined people stuck and desperate. I have used my previous characters again and you can check out my other stories for their descriptions.
George, Patty, Joan and Paula are all sitting in traffic on the Tappan Zee Bridge, all having to pee so badly they don&#039;t to what to do. They are each coming home from a long holiday weekend and are casually, but nicely dressed. Joan is wearing a white sweatshirt with a sailboat on it, a pink sweater tied around her shoulders and tan shorts. George is wearing a reddish/pink button down shirt and tan slacks.

        <p class="card-text">A few years ago when I was living in London I traveled on the underground regularly (that&#039;s usually called &#039;the Tube&#039; in London, or the Subway or Metro for people outside the UK), and would often see girls who were obviously desperate for a pee.
Because there are no toilets on the Underground trains, and none on most of the stations, on many occasions I was lucky enough to witness girls getting so desperate that it resulted in a &#039;wetting&#039;, or a &#039;public peeing&#039; where the girl would just finally give up and squat down for a pee. However, this is the only &#039;Business Suit&#039; wetting that I can remember.

Jae and Penny hurried uncomfortably through the Maxiversity hallway to the next exam session. One hellish semester, six humiliating months, behind them, and still no sign of the promised revolution. Even Lisa, the eternal optimist of the Bird Women, and Caryn, the most muscular and intimidating of the oppressed group, were losing their hope. Doing her best to ignore the intense summons emanating from between her long legs, Jae shuddered to think what she and her friends would do without Lisa and Caryn to give them hope.
&quot;D&#039;you think this bunch will be as rude as the boys from last week?&quot; Jae asked Penny between short breaths.

The wait paid off, for when Katie rounded the corner towards the history library a few moments past 8:00, Penny was sitting at a table there, pretending to read an old Time magazine. &quot;Hi!&quot; Katie said cheerfully as she sat down. For once, the cheerfulness wasn&#039;t made up; Katie was delighted to have this slender reed of hope to cling to.
Penny was happy – for the first time since the Deluge – as well. &quot;Hey! I was just reading about Watergate here. It&#039;s amazing how far back the magazines go.&quot; As she closed the magazine, she couldn&#039;t help allowing a nervous glance at the Swineherd standing guard by the library door, not even fifteen feet away.

It showed me hiding behind a tree and then running across a meadow followed by some unstable shots of the sky. It went blank then showed two minutes of a close–up of some grass with a spider climbing over the plants.

Now we were standing on the platform waiting for my car while there were many other patrons doing the same. While I was somewhat uncomfortable with the stress on my bladder, I couldn&#039;t help but notice that Loretta was getting desperate for a pee.
She shifted her weight from one foot to the other and occasionally walked around in a small circle. She was wearing an off–white suit with a straight skirt and powder blue blouse. She didn&#039;t mention…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Mary Ann Gardener wrinkles her pert nose in disdain as she walks, quickly, past the ladies&#039; room. She and her husband Richard have spent the early evening dining and dancing at their country club and are getting ready to go home. She can make it home; She is a lady, a grown woman, not a child. She dislikes public restrooms anyway. She really doesn&#039;t like to pee in a restroom at all. It is no secret. There is more, but it is very secret. No one must ever know. Mary Ann is a lady. She keeps the arousing thoughts away. Richard would never understand.
The petals of Mary Ann&#039;s flower part slightly, an immeasurable microscopic fraction of a millimeter, a yawn, the miniscule beginning of an awakening. She does not…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Paula is a woman I used to work with in the office of a furniture store. She is in her late forties, pretty with sort curly blonde hair and blue eyes and glasses. However, her looks also reveal a hard life having her husband leave her and supporting a child on her own through a series of low–end clerical jobs where she was never treated well. I saw her need to pee badly at one time and this story feeds off of that event.
&quot;When will this lady get of the phone?&quot; Paula thought to herself. The woman on the line who kept on talking allowed Paula to at least focus on what was now becoming an urgent need to pee. It was 3:00 and all the coffee at lunch plus the many trips to the water cooler seemed to hit her bladder…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Last week I had to go to a Handy shop in a big shopping mall. My drill didn&#039;t work and i had called the shop owner if it is possible to get a new. When I arrived at the shop, it was terribly busy, so I decided to go for a little shopping tour and come back later. It was a very hot day so I went into a cafe and bought an ice cream and a coke and sat out on the balcony. Afterwards, I went into some clothing shops and bought a nice short top. Before I returned to the Handy shop I bought another bottle of coke and then I slowly walked back.
When I entered the shop, only two guys were inside looking at the shop windows. Behind the counter I saw a big very well built guy with dark brown hair and wonderful blue eyes…</p>
