Episode 5 – Wet by Dawn
Laurie&#039;s jeep stopped with screeching tires in front of the fraternity house where the big party was being held. She and Cathy had been able to hear the music from down the road, but they weren&#039;t there to party. Cathy jumped out of the jeep immediately as it came to a halt and crossed her legs with both hands grabbing at her crotch.
&quot;I don&#039;t care what you say,&quot; she snapped at Laurie, &quot;the first thing that I am going to do, is go to the bathroom!&quot;
&quot;That&#039;s where we have to go,&quot; Laurie replied as she got out too and walked toward the entrance with her thighs clamped tightly together all the time.

        <p class="card-text">(a frivolous fantasy of fidgeting females)
I imagine two women, best friends. Call them the Margarets, Maggie and Meg, and say they work together–maybe one does accounts payable and the other accounts receivable, or maybe they run the front office, one of them handling the phones and the other taking walk–in orders. Whatever. They&#039;ll be universally regarded as the two cutest women in the company. Meg, we&#039;ll say, is pretty enough in the winter months, but in summer (when she often goes around in a tank top) she&#039;ll be nothing short of breathtaking. Her breasts are large and round and firm and her bra will hold them up to make a cleavage you could lose yourself in–a valley that could engulf your whole face, or…</p>

I&#039;m a 23–year old German girl. Three weeks ago we made a tour through Europe with our motorbikes. &quot;We&quot; are five male friends and I. I was the only girl, and that was my first big tour.
At the planning of the tour meeting, I forgot something to tell to the others: I have a very small bladder. The first day was okay. It was cloudy and so it was not very hot. We started at 8:30 am and drove until 6 pm, with a break about every two and a half hours.
But, the second day was very hot. Everyone drank very much in the first break, which was at 11 am. Then we all went to the toilet before getting back on the road, myself included. After about one hour of driving, my bladder again started…</p>

Gina was in a slightly worse state. She could still walk, but she was swaying and had that far away smile on her face that happy drunks have. She was dressed in a white trouser suit. It was looking slightly…</p>

The story that I am about to tell you is from twelve years ago (give or take one) when I was working as a driver for a mini–cab company (private taxi) in North West London, near Kilburn.
Our customers were a wide range of people, many of them were regulars, and being Kilburn there were quite a lot of pubs and bars in the area, so a lot of our work in the evenings was taking customers to and from these various watering holes.
This particular evening started out just like many others, and about 7:30 I got a job over the radio to go to an address in Willesden Green which I knew very well because it was the home of one of our regular customers, an extremely attractive girl in her early twenties with long…</p>

This is a true story about my first peeing accident on our short trip to Paris.
I am a 20 years old girl from Germany and I had a very bad peeing accident last week at our school trip to France. It was a very hot day when we had our last day in Paris. It was 8 or 9 o&#039;clock p.m. when we left our hotel and put the luggage in the bus. We had to drive nearly 10 hours home, so my friend Marie and I bought 2 six packs beer and a bottle wine to have a party during this long journey. We drank a lot and had a lot of fun.
After 2 hours I first recognized that my bladder was full. The toilet in the bus was defective so we had a break every 2 hours to go to the bathroom. The last break was only 15 minutes ago so…</p>

When we are at home and May is going to be there alone in the evening I suggest that she locks the door after about 7 in the evening because we have had a spate of conmen trying gain entry. The summer had ended and it had turned cool with rain almost every day. I had to go to a meeting that finished after 9 and would not be back till after half past. In order to be linked we had a meal together as well as a large bottle of fizzy orange. My meeting would end with a cup of tea so she promised to have one at the same time. We would wait till I got back to let it out. 
Well, the meeting lasted a bit longer than expected, as did the tea drinking so both of us had an extra cup. On the…</p>

        <p class="card-text">You would hardly expect people on boats to have much chance to indulge in gardening but you&#039;d be wrong. Lots of boats have rows of window boxes lined up on the roof (cabin top) alight with displays of flowers and I&#039;m a bit sniffy about them. I take a practical attitude to our boat and like to think of myself as an accomplished sailor doing things in a workmanlike manner. To me the cabin top is working space not to be cluttered with frivolities.
May, on the other hand, likes to see the plants and suggested that we join the bourgeoisie. I was having none of it but she persisted till I said in jest that the only plants I could accept would be good practical vegetables. And this I supposed was an end to the…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Jessica crossed her left leg tightly over her right. She took a deep breath and glanced at her wristwatch– twenty–five more minutes to go. She squeezed her thighs together as tightly as she could, then took another swig from her nearly empty water bottle.
These 90–minute lectures always seem to last forever, Jessica thought, especially when your bladder is full! She gulped down the last of her water as the twinges from below resumed. Jessica shifted in her seat and began to nervously bounce her left leg.
It had been almost a year since she had done anything like this. Jessica had renounced hold–it games when she went away to college. Such potentially embarrassing pastimes had no place at a university. This…</p>

        <p class="card-text">I first met Joanna when I was a graduate student in biology at Tulane University in New Orleans. As an upper division life sciences major, I had been finally granted the coveted privilege of access to Tulane&#039;s renowned Herkimer Primate Biology Research Center. Joanna wasn&#039;t much older than I, but she had been one of those prodigies who had been granted admission to New Orleans prestigious Newcombe College immediate after her sophomore year in high school, and was currently engaged in the research underlying her doctoral thesis.
