        <p class="card-text">As I mentioned in some of my other stories, I lived in the dorms in college. It was cheap and it was one of the best damn times I&#039;ve ever had. And it is the only time I have ever witnessed mass desperation by an entire floor of women. If you have read my other stories, then you are aware that in my freshman year I lived in a dorm that had communal bathrooms and that the floors were segregated. One of the things we did on the 4th floor &quot;ZOO&quot; was to adopt the 2nd floor girls as our sister floor. Through the course of the year we did service projects together, planned parties together and just socialized a great deal. We also played practical jokes on each other, all the time. One cold crisp January morning those…</p>

        <p class="card-text">The ride had been long, hot and dusty across the Painted Desert of the American southwest in my 60 Chevy Impala convertible. Jackie and I had left for home after an early morning breakfast that included a lot of coffee and juice. We choose to go west for spring break instead of the typical Florida or Padre Island thing that most college kids choose, as we both loved the desert and had friends in Palm Springs. As we drove along that stretch of deserted blacktop, listening to music on the radio, we talked and kept drinking away at a cooler of cokes that we had purchased. A couple of hours into the desert, having long passed the last remnants of civilization, or at least a gas station with a bathroom, I noticed…</p>

        <p class="card-text">From an early age I discovered that I obtained much sexual pleasure from holding my pee until I was really desperate. I&#039;ve often played little games with myself whilst out and about just seeing how long I can hold out without going to the toilet. Last weekend I woke up needing a wee but decided to hold on. I was planning a shopping trip and the thought of walking around town whilst desperate to wee was already turning me on. I drank plenty of orange juice with my breakfast and could already feel the pressure on my bladder building up. I put on my short denim skirt and a pair of black panties and set off for town.
The town was very busy and there were lots of queues. At one point whilst waiting at the bank I…</p>

Episode 4 – The Wet Zone
As Laurie&#039;s jeep was riding over campus grounds once more, she had some trouble keeping her mind on the road. Laurie sat fidgeting in her seat, trying to keep her feet on the pedals; she was wearing sandals, and she could see her toes curling in them. Her white cotton panties were already wet with sweat, partly from the heat, partly from the excitement but mostly because she was holding her sphincter muscle closed with all the strength in her body. Laurie was wearing a pink dress with a flower pattern, and both her thighs were pressing hard against each other through it; the soft fabric was the only thing that prevented her equally sweaty legs from…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Randi was kicking herself for not going to the bathroom before setting out on her bike for a day&#039;s ride. Of course, there wasn&#039;t much to kick. At barely 100 pounds, she was a petite brunette with a small chest and a cute smile that showed off her braces. She had a slim figure and dark brown eyes that often shined in a naughty way when Randi had one of her schemes in mind. This was one of those schemes. She was scolding herself for leaving the house in tight, white jeans without peeing first, but it was a playful scolding and she intended to have fun today. The five glasses of water were beginning to make Randi feel full as she rode through the countryside that surrounded her house. She rationalized that that…</p>

        <p class="card-text">MaryBeth Pickman did little to hide her annoyance when her mother told her that the family was going to the zoo for her little brother Joey&#039;s birthday. She was, after all, eighteen years old, an adult and far too old to be going to the zoo with a small child. But, her mother had used the famous &quot;as long as you&#039;re living under my roof, you&#039;re living under my rules, and I say you are coming,&quot; and MaryBeth was forced to go. She was more than a little upset, thinking it unfair for her mother to say that to her, but she had little choice and that Friday found herself riding next to an overly excited Joey who did little more than talk about how much he wanted to see a real live elephant.

She realized she had a full bladder and she was squirming somewhat in her tight gray gabardine skirt as she worked. Not to worry as she would be finished in a few minutes and would be free to go to the bathroom on the way home. 
It was a fine Saturday morning in 1957 that Nancy found herself working. The building was open and therefore the office was open. She wanted to impress her boss with her sense of duty.

Of course, the principal didn&#039;t know that over half of the seniors had snuck in alcohol, sneaking drinks in the bathrooms or out by their cars when the chaperones weren&#039;t looking.

One day, a few years ago Donna was outside with a few friends in the garden and they were all very giggly. At one point they were challenging each other to do all sort of things. Finally they challenged one of the girls to wet herself, which she did to her friends&#039; shock and laughter. They all laughed so hard that they almost ended up with wet pants.
A few days later she was in a store with one of those friends and she had to pee. Donna suggested to her that she could always pee her pants, just like the last time. Her friend suddenly got real nervous and giggly and asked Donna if she really meant that. Donna pressed the girl to just go in…</p>

Casey expressed the interest of getting me into a situation where she could get me desperate to go. She said the ultimate goal was to see me soak myself. I was a bit turned on by the idea. I have previously written about a situation I had with a good friend of mine, Brooke, last Christmas when we had both wet ourselves. That turned into a pretty orgasmic situation. So I knew…</p>

        <p class="card-text">When I was a student I spent some time on an exchange scheme in Germany and part of this time was spent in Berlin. One day our group was taken on a coach tour of East Berlin. We set off at 8.00, right after breakfast in the hostel canteen. I was pleased to find that I was sitting next to Daniella, a pleasantly rounded Dutch girl who I had noticed before. She filled her skin–tight jeans to perfection, and the outline of her low–cut 1&quot; knickers was clearly visible. Her T–shirt showed she was not wearing a bra. We chatted away freely as we passed through the checkpoint and into the Eastern Zone. We started talking in German, as we were supposed to, but Daniella soon asked me to use English as she was much more…</p>

        <p class="card-text">When I was in college I lived in the dorms on campus. I just couldn&#039;t afford not to. You see, I grew up farming and ranching and I am very good with my hands. My sophomore year at college, the Dorm system I lived in consisted of three buildings that needed a new maintenance man as the last one had graduated. The dorms and the college in general tried to give as many jobs as they could to the students to give them extra money. Of course if there were any major construction or re–construction going on, the physical plant personnel would come fix the problem. But for basic closet door repair, painting and the like, I was able to handle. In return I got my room and board for free as a member of staff, which was…</p>

        <p class="card-text">I opened the car door, grabbed her by the hand, and pulled her roughly out of the car. &quot;Look at you, you slut!&quot; I yanked down the top of her knit dress exposing her titties. She was bent forward pressing her hands against her pussy. &quot;Lean on the car,&quot; I said, twisting her to face the car. She was squirming and wiggling. &quot;I can&#039;t believe you just peed in my car,&quot; I said. I tugged her tiny dress up exposing her panties. I could see her crotch was moist and still dripping. &quot;Goddamn it, I can&#039;t believe you just pissed in my car. And look at you, wet panties and all.&quot; Her back was arched, her butt sticking out, grinding in mid–air. &quot;I couldn&#039;t help it,&quot; she said whining, &quot;I have to pee so bad it hurts!&quot; &quot;Hold still…</p>
