        <p class="card-text">George Robinson, the scientist, is in his early 50&#039;s. He is clearly all about no–nonsense old school type research. George prides himself on his analytical skills and determination to get things done. Now, however, George is simply baffled. His latest device fails to work. He has checked and rechecked his design; this doesn&#039;t happen to him. Based on secret medical data, the device is intended to project a signal to enemy soldiers, which will be received directly into the brain. This signal is computer generated and intended to mimic human synaptic generation. The frequency projected is a type of biosynthetic feedback cycling sine wave, modulating throughout an identified human receptive range. Its purpose is…</p>

He had run his small jewelry store by himself since he opened a year ago, but business had picked up and he decided to get someone part time to help out. He thought Jenny was so cute but too young. She had a pretty smile and long blonde hair and a tiny sexy body. And she was wearing a cheerleader uniform.
&quot;Hello Mr. Thompson, I am Jenny. Amanda told me you needed somebody part time.&quot;
&quot;My daughter, Amanda?&quot;
&quot;Yes Sir, we are in the same class at school.&quot;

        <p class="card-text">I&#039;ve always been a bit of a dirty girl. I like to piss my panties whenever I can and even better, I love to watch a hot sexy girl lose control and piss inside her clothes. This is exactly what happened to me last summer, when I was 18.
I was on a night out with a group of friends. I was already really horny because before I had gone out, I&#039;d taken a shower, making sure I was desperate before I got in. It turned me on so much to step away from the shower and let my piss go, running down the insides of my legs until I came with pleasure.
But when we arrived at the bus stop, I saw Sophie was there, looking gorgeous and sexy. Her wonderful, full breasts were pushing to escape from her strappy top and her blue…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Some years ago a small group of us used to get together on Saturday mornings and go to garage sales together. There were normally five of us, just friends, two girls, and three blokes. We would look the garage sales up in the paper, consult the street directory, and work out the most direct route to follow to get around them all.
One Saturday one of the two girls couldn&#039;t come, leaving only four of us. I was already aware that Sally, the girl who did come, tended to have a smallish bladder, so I was interested to see that she brought a can of soft drink with her, which she drank on our way to the first house.
Needless to say, after what seemed like a reasonable amount of time for the fluid to be making its…</p>

She smiled and rubbed her left leg against my thigh –– such a wonderful way to start the day and I did not suppress the groan at the pleasure it brought me. I reached down and stroked her thigh as it came within reach, relishing the softness of her skin.
&quot;That was quite a revelation last night,&quot; she said, smirking, her blue eyes peeping through the strands of her fringe. &quot;Why didn&#039;t you tell me about your.... interest before?&quot;
&quot;Why do you think?&quot; I said, shrugging slightly. &quot;I didn&#039;t think you&#039;d be interested. More likely, I thought it would scare you off.&quot;

Waiting impatiently at yet another red light, she snatched the opportunity to tightly clench her thighs, something she found very difficult to do when actually driving. She closed her eyes, slapping the palm of her left hand repeatedly against the edge of the steering wheel. She had no idea why this should help her fight off the nearly–overwhelming urge to release the contents of her swollen bladder, but it did.
&quot;Oh, come on!&quot; she complained to the traffic light whose baleful red stare had halted her progress. The pain was growing intolerable.
Of course, she&#039;d been forced to hold on to a full bladder often enough in her career, especially…</p>

When he&#039;d suggested tying her up for the evening, she had been excited. This kind of foreplay had such a profound effect on Michael and invariably led to the most amazing sex. She had agreed readily, and without giving her time to reconsider, Michael had promptly dragged into the bedroom and started tying her up.

One day we got a package in the mail that had freezer gel packs to keep the contents cold. I looked at those gel packs and looked at Mary. I told her the gel packs would be part of our next bladder control scene. She got a terrified look on her face because she knew exactly what I had in mind.
That night we went to the local tavern for dinner and a few brews. I told Mary not to pee because I wanted to feel her swollen and hard bladder before we made love. She does this often and it turns us both on. We had 3 or 4 beers that night. She had no problem avoiding the…</p>

&quot;I am a little,&quot; said Helen. &quot;I&#039;d been expecting something a bit more ... well ... spectacular.&quot;
She looked around once again while Andy drove the punt pole deep into the riverbed and looped the mooring chain around it. They were hove–to in the middle of a clear, shallow pool with a sand and gravel bottom. It was no more than fifty metres long, and perhaps thirty metres across at its widest point. Long strands of green weed streamed out in the current, and the occasional stickleback darted in and out between them. At the upstream end of the pool was an ugly concrete weir over which the river rushed headlong in an angry,…</p>

        <p class="card-text">I&#039;d been called in to investigate a commercial burglary. As the first detective on the scene, I walked into the second floor office. I saw a beautiful woman tied to her office chair: her arms bound to the chair arms, and her legs tied apart, also to the arms of the chair. Her skirt had ridden up to reveal some of her beautifully nylon–clad legs. She was blindfolded. There was a piece of duct tape securing her mouth. She was pulling and writhing against the restraints in an effort to get herself out of the chair.
I removed the blindfold and I showed her my badge, and her eyes signaled her relief. From under the duct tape, she was trying to talk or scream to no avail. The crime scene investigators were on their…</p>

        <p class="card-text">This is a story, part fact– part fiction about my mate&#039;s mum, Brenda. In the late 70s, she was in her mid 30s and had a medium build, an hourglass figure with ample round rear, small waist, and generous bust. Looking back, she was quite attractive.
In those days, women of her age dressed smartly with a skirt, blouse, and &#039;American Tan&#039; tights. Usually, her skirts were lined too, with the lining sometimes drooping down a half an inch or so revealing a lighter colored material under her skirt, which was a nylon type of material. When she walked you could hear the swishing sound the lining made as her nylon tights rubbed against it, often the static would cause the lining to rise up under her skirt. No one would…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Sayuri shifted uncomfortably in the driver&#039;s seat of her Mercury Tracer. She had been sitting there for more than two hours: Her butt was numb; the backs of her thighs ached, and her bladder was almost bursting. She reflected ruefully that they never showed this aspect of a stakeout in the movies. Male detectives either had cast–iron bladders, or they would simply step out of the car and pee in the gutter. For a woman, that wasn&#039;t an option, especially not on a street bordered on one side by a high wall and on the other by a residential estate. She adjusted herself in her seat, flicking her long, black, slightly curly hair over her shoulders, and wondered how much longer she would have to sit there before her…</p>

        <p class="card-text">The sunlight shone in from the east, filtering through the white curtains, casting patterns upon the hardwood floor of the upstairs bedroom. The window was open, the cool morning breeze wafting gently throughout the room, birds chirping as the new day began. Next to the window, to the left, stood a cabinet, filled with picture frames and mementos. On top of the cabinet sat an old alarm clock, manual wind, a worn cell phone, and a hairbrush. A few bobby pins lay next to the hairbrush, along with a torn piece of paper with a phone number on it. To the right of the window there was open space; only a faded picture of an old Elle magazine cover hung sloppily in a cheap frame. Within the wall to the right of the…</p>

I was shopping at the local supermarket and was packing the goods as they came through the checkout. It was quite a busy time and there was a long queue at each till. When the last items came through, I packed them up and turned to pay the cashier. As I handed over the money I heard someone say &quot;Noooo&quot; in a shrill anguished voice. I looked, and the next lady in line had her hands firmly jammed in her crotch and was doing a frantic pee–pee dance. As I collected my change she seemed to get herself under control. I turned to her and said that I sympathized with her predicament and asked her whether I could help…</p>
