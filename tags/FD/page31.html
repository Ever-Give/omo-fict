        <p class="card-text">Karen, Mia and I had been friends since going to college at Ohio State University. We had all had a few serious dating relationships since college, but always seemed to get back together when those relationships failed.
This weekend we rented a cabin and a rowboat in the woods near a small lake in West Virginia. The cabin included just the bare necessities, and was pretty isolated from the rest of the campers on the lake.
We started drinking beer about 7:00 pm, and decided to take the rowboat out for a trip around the lake. We took a cooler of beer with us, and headed out to explore the lake. Blond haired, blue–eyed Karen was wearing a white t–shirt, a pair of loose fitting blue and white cotton shorts, and…</p>

        <p class="card-text">It was a cold, wet, stormy night. The house was warm, though, the wood–burning stove defied the wind and rain outside.
Ellen had been sitting near the fire. She&#039;d also had several mugs of drink during the evening; but now it was bedtime, past bedtime in fact. She went to clean her teeth and pee before going upstairs – there wasn&#039;t space upstairs for a bathroom, which meant that getting up in the night for the toilet could be a chilly experience.
Once in her pajamas she quickly got into bed. For a while she read a book, but soon she felt sleepy, so she put the light out and went to sleep.
Some time later, she woke up, for no apparent reason. The wind was still howling outside, and rain lashed against the…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Ashley took a deep breath and opened the door to her classroom; she had to be ready to execute her plan. You see, Ashley loved to piss her pants and panties; she loved the feeling of holding a full bladder as long as she could. But one thing she loved even more was the satisfaction of being humiliated and embarrassed while being seen in public. She got horny at the thought.
So Ashley came up with a brilliant plan, she had asked for a study session with Mrs. Ross, a middle aged blonde haired woman, who was quite attractive. Ashley chose her for two reasons– one: the thought of wetting herself in front of her hot biology teacher made her insanely horny, and two: the fact that Mrs. Ross had some strict rules…</p>

        <p class="card-text">One of the great things about being a middle–aged dad is having older teenage kids. They are fun at that age and they like it when dad loses the &quot;grown up speaks to child&quot; demeanor and becomes one of them for a moment or two.
In her 18th year, my middle daughter was a real knockout. She was tall and slender and kept after herself. As I look back, I miss all those girly things like shampoo and perfume smells, her music playing and her giggling with her friends when she filled the house with other pretty teens. Sometimes her friends would do the courteous thing and say hello to &quot;the Dad&quot; or give a nod or wink. What these kids choose to wear, or not to wear today makes me crazy and I confess, I get really hot…</p>

The dial read 75, the speed limit sign read 60, but Amber kept on speeding, the traffic was light and the highway smooth. Grimacing, she pushed the pedal further, up to 80. She took a last sip from her quart of water, tossing the empty bottle into the passenger seat beside her. She clenched her legs together as best she could while she drove, her bladder swollen full with pee. Amber was desperate, her bladder sending SOS signals, her tummy swollen, her tight tan khaki slacks pressing against the…</p>

        <p class="card-text">As some of you may know, I really enjoy frantic desperation– a man&#039;s or mine. Generally I do my monster holds at home as I have never wet myself as an adult and I can&#039;t imagine the public embarrassment. I have often wondered if I am really holding my maximum when I do this, as I know that the toilet and measuring jug are near by when I am home and full.
I decided to do something different today. I went to visit a friend about 300 miles away for the weekend. We had fun but frankly, it was a little boring. So this morning I decided to set a few rules for the trip– no stopping at all– and I must consume 12 oz. of liquid every half an hour. I also knew that as I became more and more desperate the feelings would…</p>

        <p class="card-text">It has been a long weekend and I am now a bit bored. Memories from last Sunday&#039;s monster hold make me feel warm and that makes me want to ride the piss wave of beautiful agony again. I was going to give my bladder a break but an opportunity came up so, I decide to try another hold. Not as long as last week, I know that I will never hold out at home like I did in the car. Having a toilet nearby is too much temptation for me. I am going to really push the fluid though – 20 ounces every half hour, 8 ounces more each half hour than last week&#039;s hold. Maybe it will fill me fuller, faster. Here are my notes.
1 pm – I open a diet coke, a friend comes by to take me shopping. She goes to the bathroom and complains…</p>

At one particular casino, which we used to go to quite often, there was a female croupier who was always very jovial and chatty, very different from the sour–faced type that many of them seem to be. Even though she (usually) still managed to take our money, it was always more fun when she was dealing, and all the regular customers knew her quite well, my wife and I included.
I&#039;ll call this croupier Sally for the purpose of telling you about the incident, she was about 20 years old, she did tell us her age once, but I can&#039;t remember. She was nicely slim and had long, slightly curly, blonde hair, and a…</p>

        <p class="card-text">CHAPTER V – The Bird Women
The following evening capped off a long day for Katie. Those two months had been so bleak and hopeless for the once–serene girl, now that she had found a ray of hope, she&#039;d found herself clinging so fiercely to it that she was beginning to get paranoid about things slipping away once again. It was two minutes to the start of Free Hour, and Katie had been pacing furiously back and forth across the floor of her hideout, praying that Penny would be there and that she&#039;d had better luck than Katie in tracking down recruits; Katie hadn&#039;t seen Lisa or Caryn at all that day.
Her fears subsided a bit when a tall, stocky girl with blonde curls appeared in the doorway. Initially terrified…</p>

        <p class="card-text">First– a big Thank you to all of the people who have sent us their best wishes. We apologize if we have been unable to reply to you personally since by publishing our e–mail address we have attracted a spate of adverts to make big willies or illicit CDs or see pictures of naughty women and we delete these. Some of your replies may have been amongst the twenty or so we now get each week.
Second– we must also apologize to those who have taken all of our tales as complete truth. In order to join them together we have had to fabricate some sections but each one has a kernel of what really happened. Our children are not really called Stanley and Hilda; neither are we Robert and May. I hope we are forgiven for this…</p>

        <p class="card-text">My name is Becky. I&#039;m a Dutch national and a twenty–four year old PA to an advertising executive in Reading, UK, where I live with my boyfriend Marcus, a university tutor who is sixteen years older than me. The following is a true account of a wetting accident that I had in public last month.
It was a warm Saturday afternoon and I had been enjoying lunch at a riverside restaurant with three girlfriends. Marcus had promised to pick me up on his way back from work at 2:30pm but was late, so at 2:50pm I was standing alone in the car park waiting for him. I had drunk three glasses of wine at lunch and was feeling pleasantly merry, but also in desperate need of a wee. I had declined to use the facilities in the…</p>

        <p class="card-text">10:00 AM. Jenny rose off her couch, still in her nightgown, barely out of bed, and walked over to the window. She peered outside at the early summer day, clouds puffy and white in the sky, people walking along the busy street in the harried pace of the office employee, heads down, moving with purpose along the sidewalks. Moving from the window to her dining table, she picked up her resume and read it once again, double–checking for spelling errors and considering yet again rewriting her summary to put a different slant on her skills. The interview was at 12:00 noon downtown, about a mile away from her upscale apartment and Jenny was nervous. She needed a job, and the economic woes had made them scarce to come…</p>
