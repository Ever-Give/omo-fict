        <p class="card-text">Ellen was a colleague of mine at a large advertising agency. She and I were competing for the same promotion. The bosses at the agency made it clear that the winner got the job, and the loser had to leave.
Ellen is a bright and attractive woman in her late 30&#039;s who was completely driven by work and success. So far as anyone knew, she had no private life. Her dress was stylish, but her in–office demeanor very prim. Ellen also never admitted mistake, nor showed any remorse. Her goal was to succeed by any means necessary. We did not work together, and our relationship was limited to saying hello to one another in the hallways.
For six solid months Ellen and I competed for the coveted vice–president&#039;s position.…</p>

        <p class="card-text">I drank quite a bit this afternoon and now sitting at my desk, still in my work clothes, fully conscious of the way my bladder is filling. I&#039;m at the point where I&#039;m only slightly uncomfortable – I fidget from the time to time and although I try to keep my thighs from touching they snap together when I&#039;m not being vigilant.
Oh how I love this. Figured it was a good time to introduce myself. I&#039;m a closet case. Twenty years old and my boyfriend doesn&#039;t know a thing about this little obsession of mine. I am very secretive about it. But I feel like sharing this bit of myself with you.
Ever since I realized that being desperate gives me a huge thrill, I started experimenting with it. Drinking a lot in school and…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Rachael would have given anything to thrust her hands between her legs and press her fingers against her pee–hole, but sitting at a supermarket checkout, it was not possible to hold herself without everyone seeing. And yet she would have to do something soon or she would piss her jeans before her shift ended at ten.
The damned place was always short of staff, and her stints on the checkout were always far longer than they were supposed to be. She had started this session at five o&#039;clock to cope with the influx of customers who stopped to shop for groceries on the way home from work. John Smithers, the supermarket manager, had promised that the evening staff would turn up by six and she would be free to leave…</p>

        <p class="card-text">This is another story from my younger days. As you might know from reading my other stories I had a problem admitting to other people that I had to pee, especially when I was younger. There was one incident where it could have gotten me into a ton of trouble both with my parents and the owners of an appliance store. Let me explain.
Our refrigerator had broke, or was in the process of breaking so my parents decided to go shop for a new one after dinner. Now for some reason I had to come along. It was summer at the time, so I really can&#039;t think of a reason I would have been tagging along for something so boring. I must have been in trouble for something at the time but I can&#039;t quite remember if that was the…</p>

        <p class="card-text">&#039;T was the night before Christmas, when all through the house No creatures were stirring, except me and my spouse;
Our bladders we&#039;d been filling by the chimney without care, In hopes that even St. Nicholas our pants could not spare;
Then we&#039;d nestled down all snug in our bed, While visions of sexy accidents danced in our heads;
And mamma in her panties and I in my cap, Had just settled in, but for much more than a winter&#039;s nap;
When out on the lawn there arose such a clatter, Our hands sprang to our pants stop the leaking from our bladders;
Away to the window we flew like a flash, And stood crossing our legs while we threw up the sash;
The moon on my wife&#039;s breasts, which were as white as snow, Gave the…</p>

        <p class="card-text">It was a sunny but not too hot day in autumn. Carlene and I had agreed to meet after work to do a bit shopping and to enjoy the sun in a street cafe. It was already fairly cold in the morning, so that I had decided for an ankle length skirt and slightly thicker pantyhose. Carlene was wearing black leather pants that I had never seen on her before. They were skin–tight, reaching down to her lower legs, with zippers on the outside. Under those pants she was wearing black pantyhose and dark red ballerinas. Typically for her, her hose had runs at both heels one of which reached up to her pants. Although the ballerinas hid her toes, a huge run on her right forefoot allowed for the assumption that not too many of…</p>

&quot;We&#039;re gonna be freezing in no time,&quot; I said quietly to Katia.
&quot;We could just keep peeing to keep warm,&quot; she said jokingly. Then almost at the same time we realized that it might not be such a crazy idea.

We, that is, three girlfriends and me, were planning to stay for all three days, with the nights to be spent in our four tiny one–person tents. We had learned from last year&#039;s festival that we should not bring with us too many spare clothes, as there would be no time nor space to change. At least we had decided to dress a bit more attractively, after our woollen–socks–and–sandals outfit had made us kind of outsiders last year.
This year, I decided to wear a plain black skirt, a bit less than knee–long and not too tight, together with black tights and ankle–strap sandals without…</p>

As a divorcee of 30, Lindsay was flattered when one of the younger men at work asked her to join a group of his friends going to the rugby match. The group consisted of two other couples who were all in their 20&#039;s. The other two girls were Tracy, about 25, slim with dark hair and thick glasses, which spoiled her looks, and Belinda, well built, a blonde about 28. Both were casually dressed, Tracy in the tightest pair of jeans you could imagine, and Belinda in a denim mini–skirt, which was both short and tight. Lindsay had also gone for the casual look, wearing jeans, not as tight as Tracy&#039;s with a sweater and anorak. As you might expect from a rugby crowd, they met in a pub…</p>

        <p class="card-text">It was another boring day, as always, 25–year–old Victoria thought as she sat on the edge of her bed. She sat there, letting the warm sun soak her through the windows, glistening on her tight, tan body. She ran her hand over her rock hard abs and smiled as she looked down at herself. She loved her body and she loved the attention it got. She didn&#039;t have a boyfriend but she loved fucking a different guy every night. She knew she was a total slut and didn&#039;t care. She sat there thinking how it was Thursday, wishing it were Friday so she could go clubbing. It wasn&#039;t worth going on Thursday nights, though; the clubs weren&#039;t even half packed.
Finally, she got off the bed and walked to the window in her light green…</p>

        <p class="card-text">She rapped loudly at the door. &quot;What&#039;s taking so long? Get out already!&quot;
I was mildly annoyed. What was this woman&#039;s problem? It was Marie&#039;s voice, I realized. That particular co–worker of mine was a little uptight – especially since she lost that weight – but I brushed it off and figured she was just cranky. This was a bit much, though. I had only been in the bathroom for a minute.
&quot;Can&#039;t a girl pee in peace?&quot; I said loudly, my bladder leisurely emptying.
&quot;HURRY UP!&quot; she almost shouted. &quot;You&#039;re such a selfish pig! Don&#039;t you realize you&#039;re not the only female who pees in this office?&quot;
Now I was mad. True there was only one bathroom for each gender but gosh she didn&#039;t have to talk like that. I finished,…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Hello, my name is Anna M. If you haven&#039;t read any of my other stories, here&#039;s a quick intro: I&#039;m a girl who only pees at home, no matter what! I pee in the morning before I leave and then just hold it in till I get back home in the evening... some people call that an &quot;All Day Girl.&quot; :–)
Well, this is a story about the time I had to take an ultrasound scan last year. Routine check. As you must know, a full bladder is a requirement to take it and of course most girls just RUN to the bathroom just as soon as it&#039;s over... but I of course don&#039;t :–) Read on...
One time last year I had an appointment for an ultrasound scan and of course one must have a full bladder for it. Since I hate drinking loads of water, I…</p>
