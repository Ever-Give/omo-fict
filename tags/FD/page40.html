        <p class="card-text">As we round the corner I spot her right away, there leaning against the lamppost with her gleaming legs tightly crossed, central to my vision like she had deliberately stood where I was going to look. &#039;How about her?&#039; I say to Howie, and with a grin he pulls over. The girl smiles and walks across to the car, and I&#039;m struck by this look she has– all bright and shiny, like the sunlight&#039;s just streaming straight through her. She&#039;s maybe twenty, twenty–one, not too tall, not too blonde, and with enough showing below the line of her little yellow top to tell me she must exercise her belly every day to keep it that shape. &#039;Are you going anywhere near Brinwell?&#039; she asks, and I give Howie a look that tells him we are…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Hi! I really like your website. Something happened to me today that I want to share. There was a tube strike in London today and for the thousands of people who normally use the tube to get to work every day, it made things very difficult. I live a bit out of London and have to get a train in, and then normally get the tube to the office. With out the tube it&#039;s about an hour&#039;s walk from Waterloo station. I don&#039;t bother with buses, as they are too full and stop at every street, so they would take ages to get me where I want to go. Anyway, I got to work in the morning OK. Work was the same as usual, but in the afternoon I started feeling a bit tired, so started to up my coffee intake. I was also feeling quite…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Mia Stevens got out of her white Kia Reo, the only car she could afford when her college costs were considered, and knew that she was more than a little nervous. It was late evening on a cool September night; the sun&#039;s final blood red rays were streaming through the leaves of a nearby tree. She pulled her blue jean jacket closer around her body to fend off the wind and started up the sidewalk towards the pale green house. At the age of nineteen, Mia was a beautiful girl. She had very long, curly black hair that was pulled back into a ponytail. Her curves were perfect and well defined and her face held the very essence of beauty. She was wearing a white sweater and light, faded blue jeans, just as she had been…</p>

They knew that neither of them would be able to drive, so Jane and Lori had left their car at Jane&#039;s cousin&#039;s house where they were staying. They had been drinking for about 4 hours– and just recently had a couple of pitchers of beer. They knew that the last bus ran at 2:15am and they would have to make it or have no way home, as a person could never get a taxi at that time of night. The guys were also taking the bus, but in the opposite direction, and said that their last bus would run 1:55am. It was getting close to that…</p>

Her position was created to allow the permanent and full–time toll takers some vacation time in the summer. She was to come in on Monday, Wednesday and Friday from 10:00 AM till 3:00 PM. Her pay was quite handsome compared to the other summertime jobs she had during her college years. 
She only had to be in the booth for four hours and she had an hour for lunch. She was provided with a uniform, which consisted of: a smoky gray cotton twill blouse and A–line skirt of gabardine which had…</p>

Two glasses, and she still wanted more, but Mom interrupted her. &quot;Ashley, we&#039;re ready, say goodbye to your sister, and let&#039;s get this thing started.&quot; It was the day all recent high school graduates waited for with anticipation: the 1st day of college. The two of them had already packed up the car, cleaned out her room (that her younger sister Katie was inheriting) and was ready to go.

I was standing, as I had given my seat to an older woman a few stops ago. The man next to me got off at the next stop, exiting through the door in the middle of the bus, and the crowd of people shifted a little toward the back. I wasn&#039;t paying much attention because I was trying to pass the time by looking at the streets of the city as we drove by. I would always do this, because everyone was walking around in the center of town, including a lot of beautiful women, and it made the trip a little easier.

There shouldn&#039;t have been a problem. The train journey took only 20 minutes but as it was a sprinter with only 3 carriages there were no toilets on board. Still, there really shouldn&#039;t have been a problem.
When Carol got on the train she had a slight fullness in her bladder, but nothing serious. Besides she didn&#039;t have time to use the station toilet because the train was ready to pull out and she sure as hell didn&#039;t want to be waiting 90 minutes for the next one at this time on a winter evening.

It was late October, and that morning had been pleasantly chilly on the walk from her apartment to the station and then to her office at the end of the line. The overcast sky and the ever so slight nip in the breeze had gotten her thinking; maybe this was one of her special days. When lunchtime had finally rolled around, she&#039;d known for sure.

Nancy&#039;s wetting accident on the city bus was merely a dream, a dream that coincided with her wetting her bed after a night of beer drinking. But, the dream that seemed so real was not too far removed from some of Nancy&#039;s real experiences. You see, Nancy had more than a few public–wetting accidents in her twenty–two years.

        <p class="card-text">Laura Diaz rocked nervously watching Annika Sorenstam line up her putt. Diaz&#039;s bladder kept sending urgent relief signals, forcing the LPGA professional to squeeze her thighs together as best she could to hold her bladder in place. Unable to figure out why she needed to go so badly, Laura refocused on her game as Annika sunk her putt and moved away. Meanwhile, the foursome of Kelli Kuehne, Carin Koch, Beth Bauer and Natalie Gulbis paced the fourteenth green, each in their own gut wrenching battle with their bladders. Each used their caddies as cover to make a quick grab of relief in their crotch while no one looked. Kelli, glancing at the crowd, noticed several spectators bobbing up and down nervously, as they…</p>

        <p class="card-text">My First Wetting (Part 1)
This is the true story of my first sexual encounter with piss. It was when I was 18 during the summer break.I spent my morning reading a book and drinking as it was a fairly hot day and only went to the toilet once after I woke up. After I finished the book, I went to the mall as I was planning to see a movie with my friend Jade. I met her at the box office and we bought our tickets and cokes. It was one of those really long movies and we both wanted to watch it for some time but we hadn&#039;t come round to it so this was one of the last screenings of the movie. We entered the cinema and it was fairly empty, there were only 2 other people in there. We picked some seats at the back away…</p>

        <p class="card-text">I found this story on one of my first &#039;net surfing&#039; sessions, in 1996, but the version I downloaded was incomplete, possibly due to my inexperience on the net, ending with the girls still on the train. I have &#039;tidied&#039; the start and written an ending I consider most probable, and would have liked to have witnessed, and offer the completed story for others to enjoy. If the original author reads it, or anyone has the complete original version, I would like to have a copy, to see what really happened. The events remind me of the times when I used to drink in the West End of London at weekends, and it was possible to see at least one good desperation scene, though not up to this standard, almost every week.

        <p class="card-text">Living in the dorms in college provided a great chance to see desperate women needing to pee. My freshman year I lived in a dorm named Brandon Hall and consisted of three buildings. Brandon Hall 1, 2 &amp; 3. Brandon Hall 1 was the oldest of the three buildings and as such had communal bathrooms. 1st and 2nd floors were female floors and 3rd and 4th floors were male. Brandon 2 and 3 were both made up of suites with a bathroom between each two rooms. Brandon 2 was co–ed and Brandon 3 was all female. As a Freshman I lived on the forth floor of Brandon 1. There were two guys to a room and in the middle of the middle of the floor on one side of the hall was a large communal bathroom– 6 stalls, 6 urinal, 6 showers and…</p>
