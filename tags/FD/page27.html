        <p class="card-text">Patty Richardson checked herself for the third time – ok, she had to admit that she really looked good. Her breasts flirted with the thin silky material of her blouse, tight against her nipples. She had no need of a bra and she liked the looks she got without one. Her long shapely legs looked even more remarkable under the tight mini. Her panties played peek–a–boo with her as she turned in the mirror, her perfect ass occasionally visible under the dress as she moved. Pretty short! She decided it was just right. The 28–year–old single mother worked long hours as a social worker and the mental anguish of the job often left her numb, but tonight was girls&#039; night out. She allowed herself this luxury about once a…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Unabsorbed, Michael gazed at the TV, vaguely following the carnival bright colors of the game but oblivious to the score. Which teams were playing? He was bored.
It was Saturday and rain brushed at the window.
A murmur of voices from the street idled through the glass, diffuse in the traffic noise. They drew his attention more than the TV and gradually his focus shifted to them, striving to separate male from female, even to catch an essence of what they said. This was not idle neighbor gossip, no. There was earnestness about the voices– instructing, planning, and plotting even.
Salesmen!
His attention complete, Michael positioned himself so he could observe a small group of individuals standing huddled…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Like most girls of 18 with an older boyfriend, Jane was often anxious to impress him and not to seem too young when out with his other, older friends. She was desperately attracted to Mark, who was 27 with a good job and his own flat, and was going do to everything in her power to keep him. She was delighted when they were going on a coach outing to see their local rugby club play in a final, as it would mean a whole day out together. She was not very keen on some of Mark&#039;s rugby friends, but she would put up with this and show him how much she was a rugby enthusiast.
Jane was just above average height and build– nicely rounded, with shoulder length light brown hair that she had streaked blonde. For the…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Prince Kadrid stood at the silk–draped doorway to his royal harem, smiling at the sight of almost two dozen women from around the world, dressed in sheer dresses and skirts, lounging in the gorgeous rooms in the tropical sunlight. Holding back the silks, he entered, pulling behind him the new visitor to the palace, Darren, a tall, muscular man with a dark tan and short hair. Darren was a distinguished quest, and therefore was to have a pair of women for the night. Darren gaped at all of the women, and slowly walked around the rooms to find the ones he liked best. Finally, Darren pointed at two slender, tall women who were among a group talking softly together on the patio, sipping at tall pink lemonades. Cara…</p>

I&#039;m a truck driver.
That doesn&#039;t mean I&#039;m fat and sloppy – the girls say I look OK at thirty–one, and I have had my share of relationships. But spending most of my life in transit makes for a lousy home life, so I&#039;m single.
I was on an overnight ferry to the continent, going to Hamburg with a load of machinery. I don&#039;t drink much on these trips, but that doesn&#039;t keep me from spending the night in pubs or the discotheque.
She was sitting by herself. I had seen her with two friends, but they were flirting energetically with a bunch of economists from Croydon (they were very loud) and this girl was not included. I didn&#039;t exactly…</p>

        <p class="card-text">I am a night watchman.
It means I spend my working hours prowling an empty and, after the company decided to cut electricity costs, dark building– socially, a hopeless job. The advantages are, I can nip into an empty office and browse the Net, or I can read any kind of magazine on the job, or I can look out of the windows.
There is an alley behind the building. Late at night when the bars close I can watch people walk or stagger home. Loud groups, solitary drunks, newly attached couples, single disappointed males, and also giggling girlfriends. Occasionally some of them slip into the alley for privacy. They don&#039;t know I have a perfect view from the first floor. To be unseen from the street you have to hide…</p>

She loved this feeling, being on the edge of desperation, and considered going back to sleep. &#039;No,&#039; she decided, she better get up, because she wasn&#039;t sure she could hold it until morning, and her boyfriend was over. Even though he knew of her fetish, they had never really practiced it together before, because she was shy. Karen tried to sit up and realized her ankles were chained to the bed. She rolled over and nuzzled her boyfriend, but Josh was already awake. She could feel him watching her in the dark. &quot;Honey, where&#039;s the key?&quot; but he just chuckled and asked why.

Jenny needed to pee. It wasn&#039;t an extremely urgent need (at least not yet, anyway), but it was enough to cause her some discomfort. She had been bagging groceries nonstop for the past 2 1/2 hours, and it wasn&#039;t even an hour and fifteen minutes into her shift that she began to feel that familiar sensation of painful pressure weighing down on her urethra. Jenny was an attractive Caucasian girl, with a slim body and shoulder–length dark blonde hair. But now her cute face was beginning to show the strain caused by the increasing heaviness in her bladder.
A customer noticed her furrowed brow and pursed lips and asked her if there was anything wrong.

The high–rise building was new, the crowning jewel of the airport hotels, rising 15 stories into the clear night sky, suites along the very top floors and well appointed rooms below.

        <p class="card-text">Sorry it&#039;s taken me a while to have a story to share with you guys. I have been tied up in a serious relationship with my girlfriend Ashley and that hasn&#039;t really brought up any desperate situations. She is so hot and I love her to death. However, I have been wishing I could witness her in a desperate situation.
The last story I shared was about one of her friends who almost wet her pants on a way to a party. I was disappointed when she made it out dry. It&#039;s been a year or so since I have fooled around with Kendra in plotting &quot;accidents&quot;. I do keep in touch with her even though she too is dating someone right now.
But let me shift my attention to Ashley. Last week we had been shopping around at the mall all…</p>

        <p class="card-text">As a South African working in England, Sonia wanted to see her national team when they were touring, and she was delighted when one of her office colleagues, Tony, a dedicated rugby fan, offered to include her in the party he was organizing to the England v. South Africa match at Twickenham. Tony was a regular at Twickenham internationals, and the group followed his usual plan to avoid the worst of the crowds– travel by public transport, stop at a little–known pub, and then walk to the ground. As well as Tony and Sonia, there were two other couples, both about Tony&#039;s age, while Sonia was about ten years older. She was a tall, well–built, girl of 35, with short blonde hair, and was wearing a knee–length tweed…</p>

Part Two
This picks up where Part One left off, obviously. So if you haven&#039;t read that, scroll down and catch up on your reading. This part will make a teeny bit more sense, maybe not much, but some. This portion here contains a little bit of, shall we say, consensual roughness between the two imaginary lovers. If you&#039;re uncomfortable with that, move on. Or even if you don&#039;t think you like it, try reading it. Gosh, you know sometimes we&#039;re surprised at what we find out about ourselves.

&quot;I&#039;m totally serious. No more until we get home,&quot; I said. But looking down at your skirt, already soaked in various places, I knew I&#039;d never be able to tell if you were behaving.

        <p class="card-text">At the time it seemed the logical thing to do – but trying to persuade my wife was another matter!
We had been at the beach for a few hours already and after a couple of bottles of cool water, we both needed to pee badly. Trouble is, my wife isn&#039;t one for peeing in public – even in the sea – so she sat there fidgeting while we discussed what to do. There were basically three options. One – she could go into the sea and pee while pretending to swim or paddle or whatever it is people do when they pee in the sea. Two – we could leave the beach, return to the car and find a rest area nearby that had toilet facilities. Or three – she could pee where she was, sitting next to me, onto the towel that was still damp…</p>
