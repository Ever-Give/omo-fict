        <p class="card-text">This is a true story; it happened last May. To give you an idea of my appearance I am 5 foot 2 inches, short brown hair, wide hips and small waist, B cup breasts, had just turned 18 then, and my name is Natalie.
On May 3 I had been up most of the night studying for my three–hour advanced placement Calculus exam, drinking some coffee to stay awake while cramming. In the morning I took a shower and put on a short grey cotton skirt and red button up t–shirt with snowmobile boots, and made a last cup of tea to keep me awake. I have major problems with time management so all–nighters are pretty regular, and I always forget to drink water when I&#039;m on them, so I&#039;ve ended up dehydrated before, it&#039;s not fun.…</p>

        <p class="card-text">During the vacation after my second year at university I got a phone call from Jill, a fellow student on my course who I knew casually. We were due to attend a seminar in the city that week and Jill was going to borrow her mother&#039;s car and drive to town. She wanted to park at my house and then we could go into the city by train. She was not a particularly attractive girl, but I had nothing much going on at the time, so I told her to be here at 8.30 so we would have plenty of time to get into town.
Jill duly arrived about 10 minutes late. She was a tall thin girl, with long light brown hair but with very plain, or even unattractive, looks. However she was wearing skin–tight jeans that were stretched over her…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Juliana crossed her legs again and ordered another caffe latte. She was frankly, ready to burst, but wanted to stretch the moment for as long as she could. The thrill of being in a strange town, where she could do whatever she wanted. She was dressed in a blue cotton skirt and a red t–shirt. There were other garments in her large handbag. She drank her coffee and paid her bill, then walked in the direction of the square. Her long black hair reached almost to her waist; and below her waistline the contour of her panties was visible. She preferred full–size, as everything went straight through thongs, leaving no more than a sneeze–stain. She had lived in this country for fifteen of her twenty–three years, but…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Every detail of this story is completely true. When WW2 ended sixty years ago, my father was still in the RAF and my mother and I lived alone in a small flat at the top of a large Victorian town house in central London. We continued to live there until my father left the RAF some years after the war (he was a &#039;regular&#039; rather than an enlisted man) and we moved to other accommodation. The property was in a fashionable part of town, but had been &#039;requisitioned&#039; by the Government, that is &#039;borrowed&#039; from the rightful owners and divided up to give a roof over the heads of families made homeless by the war.
Every floor, of which there were five, had been converted into a self–contained unit, with cooking and…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Do you believe in psychic powers? You know – mind reading, and stuff like that? I never used to: but that was before I met Rosie. And believe you me, Rosie could read a man&#039;s mind, no doubt about it. Actually, let me amend that statement. Not could, but would. Did. Whether she wished to or not. To her, reading my thoughts – or any other man&#039;s thoughts, for that matter – was as involuntary a process as smelling their scent or hearing their speech. Which was scary– very scary. And because she was so very scary, she was also very lonely. Most psychics are, it seems. So if you should ever meet one, try not to let their powers scare you off. Try instead to be attentive, loving, and true. You see, they make very…</p>

The 54–year–old environmental technician normally has his time fully occupied with his two grown kids, his 14 year old, 2 grandkids and 2 more on the way. Put that together with the demands of friends and relatives and free time became a bit rare. His plans for this weekend include none of them, only himself and lots of liquids. He has gotten a head start on the planned activities by not visiting the restroom since lunch. This fact is being reviewed with caution now. It&#039;s still an hour before he gets off and his bladder is requesting relief; more than a little insistently. Frank calculates his need and wonders; his bladder is…</p>

It had been a beautiful day. A group of us from work had gone for a long ramble along the coast. We were at a place called &quot;Yorkies Knob&quot; (no kidding!) near Cairns in Australia. We had had lunch under some trees listening to the endless roll of the surf. Of course it was hot, and fortunately, we had taken plenty to drink.
After lunch we all seemed to split up a bit. I realised afterwards that my friends had sensed that Alice and I needed a bit of time alone even before we even knew ourselves! Alice has lovely long dark brown hair, and an incredibly sweet smile – I always go for the smile! To be honest, I&#039;d rather assumed that she had a boyfriend…</p>

She was simply very cute, and as hard as I tried not to stare at her as passed, I just couldn&#039;t help myself.

        <p class="card-text">Jane lived up to her name. She&#039;d always been a plain girl and somewhat unattractive, I thought. She&#039;d been a classmate of my daughter when she was in school but after they left they sort of lost touch with each other. That was nearly ten years ago.
A couple of weeks ago, who turns up on my doorstep but Jane? She still looked quite plain. Not the sort of girl that would cause me to turn my head. Anyhow, out of politeness I asked her in and offered her a cup of tea, which she gratefully accepted. I couldn&#039;t help but notice that Jane was a bit fidgety as we caught up with things that had happened to each of us since we last saw each other, and she also asked after my daughters, so I gave her their phone numbers.…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Sam took Jenny by the hand, and led her into the house. &quot;Would you like to take a bath while I run your wet things though the washing machine?&quot;
Jenny sniffed, wiped a tear from her eye with the back of her hand, and nodded meekly. So Sam led her upstairs and into the bathroom and began to run a bath, adding copious amounts of bubble bath. The sound of the water gushing into the tub was almost enough to make Jenny lose control and completely wet her knickers a second time, but she fought hard against the urge and just about managed to hold on. A couple of short leaks escaped, and she felt the pee gently dribbling down the inside of her thigh, but it was such a minor accident that Sam didn&#039;t even notice it.…</p>

        <p class="card-text">The sun shone through the window on the beautiful June morning, the slivers of sunlight beamed through the curtains into the bedroom. A ray of light hits a sleeping girl&#039;s face and she tosses and turns as she slides into consciousness. Today was Shannon&#039;s 18th birthday and she couldn&#039;t have asked for a more beautiful day to celebrate it on. There wasn&#039;t a cloud in the sky and it was a perfect 30 degrees outside. Her friends had decided that they were going to take Shannon to dinner for her birthday and then throw her a party at her friend Sarah&#039;s house. Shannon knew that she probably would get some really cool stuff for her birthday because she hounded her friends and family for weeks telling them what she…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Godfrey was sat on the train, reading his newspaper on his way home from a business trip. It was a two–carriage train and it was beginning to fill up, but the seat next to him was still empty, which pleased him. At the next station, however, several more passengers got on, including a very pretty blonde girl in her early twenties, who came and sat next to him. Godfrey shuffled up a bit to make room for the young lady. As the train pulled out of the station the young lady looked round and upon seeing that everyone was seated, she got up and went toward the toilet. She returned almost immediately and sat down looking a little irritated and uncomfortable. &quot;Typical of this damned rail company,&quot; she complained to…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Jenny said &quot;goodbye&quot; to her last client of the day, and hitched her bag up onto her shoulder as old Mrs. Finch closed the front door behind her. The sun beat down on her, and a heat haze rose from the pavement. A gentle breeze took the edge off the heat, but it was still easily the hottest day of the year so far. She felt thirsty, and wished she could take a long, refreshing swig from the bottle of water at the bottom of her bag; but she dared not. She was already feeling the first faint urges of the need for a pee, and there was nowhere that she could stop to use the toilet on the long walk across town to her old friend Samantha&#039;s house. Sure she&#039;d be able to use the toilet when she got to Sam&#039;s; but she didn…</p>
