After weeks of training and renovations to the bar, it was finally Grand Opening Day. Though it was Misty&#039;s bar, Kiran and Jamie felt as much a part of the project as she did. In fact, they had let Misty know that they were willing to work on tips alone if things didn&#039;t work out as well as planned at the start. However, Misty was hearing none of it– she was convinced the bar was going to be a great success.Misty had named it the &#039;Wild West Games Bar&#039;, which fit well with the old building located in the outskirts of town. However, the best part of the name was the neon sign. Misty had made it so only certain…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Kiran shivered with excitement as she carried Jamie&#039;s soaked bed covers downstairs to the laundry room. She could feel the wet warmness on her arms and took care not to let the bundle dampen her t–shirt. Jamie was in the washroom getting cleaned up after peeing her bed and as her first act as Kiran&#039;s master, she had instructed her to put the wet laundry into the washing machine.Kiran inhaled deeply to enjoy the scent of her girlfriend&#039;s pee one last time before tossing the bundle in. She wondered what Jamie would have in store for her– she would certainly feel compelled to get payback after what had just happened. Her vagina tingled at the thought of being subjected to all of Jamie&#039;s sexual demands. She hoped…</p>

The characters in this story are fictional. Any resemblance to actual people is purely coincidental.
Alan lived opposite a park with a clear view of the bus stop that was outside the entrance. He often used to sit and watch people coming and going through the park, and people waiting for the bus. 
Late one evening he was looking out of his window and he saw a couple of young ladies coming out of the park. They looked to be in their late teens or early twenties, and Alan thought they looked quite attractive. One was brown skinned with black hair, and the other was white skinned with ginger hair. Both were…</p>

        <p class="card-text">I am writing about my experiences with a very special woman that I felt very fortunate to meet even if it was for a limited time. It all started with my new job at an advisory and management accounting firm in Los Angeles. I had just graduated from university at the age of 23 and was a little inexperienced in the relationship department. I had never had a girlfriend or even a high school sweetheart. All my sexual experiences had come from binge–drinking campus parties and one–night stands. Admittedly, I was glad to get out of the college life and into the real world, where was I hoping to find a more meaningful relationship that I had not found up to this point.
I had graduated with good grades from a…</p>

Natalie had long dark auburn hair and was a slightly plump but pretty girl in her late teens who had a crush on me, despite the fact that I am about 20 years or so her senior. I often visited her parents at their home and Natalie would almost always sit next to me on the sofa. On a couple of occasions she had shown me something of her body, and strangely her parents hadn&#039;t objected. The first occasion was when her mum came in with some new clothes for her. She immediately took them out of the bags and held up a blouse and a bra. Without further ado she stood up, facing me, and removed her top and bra, her ample 38DD breasts bouncing…</p>

Jenny could still hear Jerry banging around in the toilet behind the hut as she finished chapter 2 of her book. It was approaching 11 am and the sun was now high in the sky. With nary a cloud in sight, Jenny had taken the opportunity to move her stool outside in front of the hut to catch some of the rays. Little beads of perspiration formed on her flat, bronze tummy as she took in the heat and she wondered if her mother had taken the day off work since it was so beautiful outside. Jenny&#039;s mother, Sandie was also a looker. Only 37, she had Jenny when she was 18. Sandie never got the chance to go to college and raised Jenny…</p>

I have been living in Portland, Oregon for some time now and I like to go out and have a drink at a bar called Thatcher&#039;s. I have never known where the restroom is and as I particularly don&#039;t like to use the toilet anyway I have never asked.
Well one day I left home and caught a bus. I stood out at that bus stop for what seemed forever when I began to realize I needed to go pee. I was meeting someone at Thatcher&#039;s and didn&#039;t want to be late so I decided to wait until I got to the bar and hopefully would find a quiet corner to pee in. As the bus came down the hill I was dancing back and forth trying…</p>

He is not the wettest diaper in the pail; I guess you could say among us pee folk. It&#039;s just that Harold is no more blessed with luck than he is with anything else. In fact, I would have to say he is good–luck challenged. Badly challenged. Ok, on a scale of 1 to 10, Harold needs a different scale.

        <p class="card-text">22–year–old Amy walked out of history class with her 19–year–old friend Jordan. They both knew they turned heads as the guys looked at Amy&#039;s fine figure in her tight blue jeans and crop top with her brunette hair tied up in a bun and Jordan in her short miniskirt and tank top, her shiny red hair reaching down to her shoulder blades.
&quot;Ha, those guys always trip over their shoelaces every time we walk out of a room,&quot; Jordan said. &quot;How the hell are we single?&quot;
&quot;Oh, speaking of guys,&quot; Amy said, &quot;I&#039;m having a little get together tonight in my dorm room.&quot;
&quot;But it&#039;s Friday! We should, like, be going barhopping and getting drunk and shit!&quot;

        <p class="card-text">I eventually got into the habit of mostly holding on all day at school and not going to the toilet. I think this probably started from spending so much time with the boys. While girls often tend to go to the toilet together, boys are much more haphazard. For example, if we were in the middle of a game of cricket or something during lunch time we&#039;d keep playing as long as we possibly could after the bell rang, and only when it was too late to go would I realize I really could have done with a visit to the toilet. The only acceptable option then would be to just hold on for the rest of the afternoon, which I always managed to, refusing to ask to be excused during class. Having always been quite a tomboy I was…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Cold Wet Weekend Part 1
Madeline was a sweet 19–year–old girl (In her mid 20&#039;s now) that used to live down the road from where I used to live. In fact, sometimes I dreamed about her. She was the nicest, not to mention the most beautiful girl in the neighborhood. She stood about 5&#039; 11&quot;, weighed about 120 pounds, long red curly hair, green eyes, bright red lips, and a dark complexion. She was pretty popular in those days, but she never went out much after she left high school. For some reason (which I do not know to this day) she didn&#039;t carry on any relationships past high school.
One hot summer evening, at an ice cream stand, we finally stood toe to toe for the first time since the 7th grade. She had claimed…</p>

He needed to work in the attic and knew it would be best done early, before the Southern California sun turned the attic into an oven. Zane rolled out of bed, dressed and set up his ladder under the attic access door. He worked quickly, tossing all his materials, tools and water jug up into the opening. Ignoring the twinge in his bladder, Zane climbed the ladder and entered the attic. He was glad to see the generous vents at each end of his attic, which would help keep air moving. Zane had just settled in a Los Angeles suburb where he had obtained a good job in information technology. The active and fit 45…</p>

She had made this, her third desperation party, a fancy dress school disco themed party and it was so good to see everyone really getting into the spirit of it. Lucy was wearing a short blue pleated skirt, which was now bunched firmly between her legs, and her blonde pigtails and pained expression really completed the effect.
&quot;Is it urgent?&quot; asked Susan.
