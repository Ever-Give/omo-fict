        <p class="card-text">Now that our family has expanded we are finding far less time to go out visiting added to which the twins want feeding every four hours at the moment, so we stay at home and remember things we did in the last four years. On Sunday evening we got out the camcorder to remind ourselves of some of the places we went. There was a short clip that neither of us could place. It showed me hiding behind a tree and then running across a meadow followed by some unstable shots of the sky. It went blank then showed two minutes of a close–up of some grass with a spider climbing over the plants.
Eventually we managed to place it. Early on in our friendship we had taken sandwiches and a flask intending to spend the day…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Loretta and I had just attended a piano concert and we were waiting in the attended parking garage for an attendant to bring my car forward. Neither of us had been able to go to the bathroom for several hours and both of us had imbibed a few beers just before the concert. Now we were standing on the platform waiting for my car while there were many other patrons doing the same. While I was somewhat uncomfortable with the stress on my bladder, I couldn&#039;t help but notice that Loretta was getting desperate for a pee.
She shifted her weight from one foot to the other and occasionally walked around in a small circle. She was wearing an off–white suit with a straight skirt and powder blue blouse. She didn&#039;t mention…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Mary Ann Gardener wrinkles her pert nose in disdain as she walks, quickly, past the ladies&#039; room. She and her husband Richard have spent the early evening dining and dancing at their country club and are getting ready to go home. She can make it home; She is a lady, a grown woman, not a child. She dislikes public restrooms anyway. She really doesn&#039;t like to pee in a restroom at all. It is no secret. There is more, but it is very secret. No one must ever know. Mary Ann is a lady. She keeps the arousing thoughts away. Richard would never understand.
The petals of Mary Ann&#039;s flower part slightly, an immeasurable microscopic fraction of a millimeter, a yawn, the miniscule beginning of an awakening. She does not…</p>

        <p class="card-text">I now present a story of male desperation. While I am strictly heterosexual, I have often been interested in male desperation– mostly concerning men who are middle aged to older, grey haired and distinguished. This is based on a true story that was told to me by a relative who knew this man. She described him as resembling the actor George Kennedy.
&quot;Damn I gotta go,&quot; George thought to himself as he gritted his teeth and squirmed in his seat. He had been sitting in a massive traffic jam on the Palisades Parkway as he was driving in to work. The drive into New York usually took 1/2 hour but he had now been sitting in traffic for well over an hour and the coffee and juice with breakfast was now catching up to…</p>

        <p class="card-text">You would hardly expect people on boats to have much chance to indulge in gardening but you&#039;d be wrong. Lots of boats have rows of window boxes lined up on the roof (cabin top) alight with displays of flowers and I&#039;m a bit sniffy about them. I take a practical attitude to our boat and like to think of myself as an accomplished sailor doing things in a workmanlike manner. To me the cabin top is working space not to be cluttered with frivolities.
May, on the other hand, likes to see the plants and suggested that we join the bourgeoisie. I was having none of it but she persisted till I said in jest that the only plants I could accept would be good practical vegetables. And this I supposed was an end to the…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Nathan said, &quot;How did that happen when you two are always pissing about?&quot; He said it as a joke when I told him I was pregnant. We had gone by car to see him and AnnaMarie after the summer tour was over. They suggested we should come and help them celebrate November 5th and I&#039;d found out about my pregnancy the previous week. My reply seemed to cause great amusement when I said, &quot;It must have happened one night.&quot;
I didn&#039;t see what was so funny, it could have been the day Robert said he felt we were stuck in a rut and we did it in a bus shelter or it might have been the afternoon the gas man came and just missed us being disgraceful in the back of the van in our own driveway.

As a sudden spasm of her distended bladder came over her, she jammed her hand into her crotch to stem the impending flood. She rubbed her pussy, hard, barely getting control. It did not bother her that a small squirt of her golden fluid had escaped despite her best efforts. Melissa had always enjoyed peeing her panties, and just because it was not convenient was little reason not to enjoy it, especially if it was out of her control. She closed her bright blue eyes for a second, enjoying the feelings between her shapely legs. Melissa kept her ex–cheerleader&#039;s…</p>

They&#039;re trouble. Nothing serious you understand. We&#039;re not talking violence here, but they do have weird senses of humor that leave the victim often failing to see the funny side. For example a girl I know was walking past one of their houses when she got utterly drenched by a bucketful of water dropped on her from a bathroom window. Bad enough, but she&#039;d been on her way to a job interview and dressed up in her best suit – black jacket, white…</p>

It wasn&#039;t that this would provide any help in keeping her silky white nylon panties dry; they had hosted her deliciously wet pussy for quite some time before her desperation (and her fingers) had entered the picture. As she contemplated her trip to the bathroom she thought how she, always so prim and proper, had arrived at this point.
She and her husband were opposites in everything they did. She was an early riser and he liked to sleep in. Since their bedroom time was so different, they discovered early in their 12–year…</p>

She had not accounted for the extra pressure on her bladder from the huge soft drink her employee had ordered for each of them at lunch. It had fallen in well with her plan so she had said nothing. Now she was beginning to wonder about her timing, to say nothing of her bladder capacity. Reminding herself of her goal, she gave herself a quick caress between her legs, then another because it felt sooo good the first time. Art would not know what hit him!

        <p class="card-text">I was seated at the computer and surfing the Web. I&#039;d only just got online and this was a new experience. Well, not so much the Web surfing, I&#039;d done that at work, but obviously there were certain kinds if sites that I didn&#039;t dare look at in work. I couldn&#039;t afford to lose my job because I&#039;d been on an inappropriate site. I don&#039;t know how they found out what you&#039;ve been looking at and I didn&#039;t want to find out.
But now I had the Web at home, I could go where I liked. I&#039;d done a lot of the porn sites, but basically I find staring at naked women rather boring. I have my own girlfriend I can see naked and she&#039;s better looking than most on the Net. So I started looking for something different. A magazine I bought…</p>

        <p class="card-text">I tightened my carpenter&#039;s belt and looked at the rotting foundations. I had taken on the job of building a new terrace on my uncle&#039;s summer house, a combination vacation and summer job. Actually there were two uncles who had built only yards apart on my grandfather&#039;s land, part of the deal being that my mother got the apartment in the city. I hefted a crowbar and tried to look mean.
— Hi there!
I turned. She was tiny, dark and beautiful, dressed in a blue micro–miniskirt and a skimpy top, sitting on the porch of the other house, looking expectantly at me.
— Deena?
She jumped up, came over and gave me a hug. –Terry!
The last time I saw her she was a skinny imp, twelve or so, with her half Thai features…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Driving on the highway, only 50 mph, and I thought I was going to KILL Tom. He&#039;d started bitching a few miles back about getting off the highway to use a bathroom. It kept getting worse, and soon he was talking about nothing else.
&quot;Come ON, Paula, I really have to go! Get over, already!&quot;
&quot;YOU make the freaking traffic thin out so I can get over, and I&#039;ll get us to a bathroom. Dammit, I have to go too!&quot;
I was a little cranky.
Trying to navigate on the highway is usually easy, but there had been a ball game, so there were about triple the amount of cars as usual, all jockeying for position. We&#039;d been stuck in the far left lane for about 5 miles.
&quot;Please oh please, get me to a toilet,&quot; whined Tom, as his…</p>

I finally worked up the courage to have a public wetting &quot;accident&quot;. I decided on a mall as the location. I didn&#039;t want to use a mall near my home for fear of being seen by someone I know, or worse yet someone who is friends with my wife. I had some errands to complete first; bank, post office etc. I drank water as I drove from one location to another. When it was time to drive to the mall I picked up two beers and another water for the ride. The mall is located in Dutchess County, New York, about 30 – 40 minutes from my home. As I was driving I could feel the pressure building.
Driving on the highway kept my mind focused and I paid…</p>

        <p class="card-text">While out to a little piano bar the other night, I ran into the ex–wife of a former neighbor. I used to go over and play cards or just hang out at their place.
When she noticed me, she came over and gave me a big hug, and we started talking about old times. I hadn&#039;t seen her in about 15 years; she is now a very striking lady of 45.
Way back when, she used to catch me looking at her gorgeous body, and I caught her once or twice looking at the front of my jeans, and she got a rise out of me at least once. But it never went beyond looking. After talking for about an hour, she left no doubt in my mind she wanted to have sex. She told me how many times she had fantasized that it was I instead of her husband she…</p>
