        <p class="card-text">On their second date Bruce and Nancy were ensconced in a neighborhood tavern where they were drinking beer and scarfing up on all the goodies that were served at the bar. They had gobbled up six or seven beers by early afternoon and a couple of bowls of chips and popcorn. After the first six beers they had both relieved themselves and were quite aware of further requirements for relieving themselves. 
Before the next requirement came to their attention, Bruce suggested that they retire to his garden apartment to grill some steaks on the balcony. Nancy thought it was a great idea and stood up to prepare to leave. Both Bruce and Nancy had a slightly full bladder but both thought that they were in control. As…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Bruce was to pick Nancy up at 5:00 PM. It was midsummer and Bruce had gotten off early from work. So Bruce went to his favorite bar to while the hours away until it became time to pick Nancy up from her place of employment.
Bruce enjoyed a few beers at his favorite bar. As a matter of fact he enjoyed too many beers. When he left to pick Nancy up he had already violated the rule of six. The rule of six means that when you have had six beers you will probably need to pee. And, when you answer that need all subsequent needs become very urgent needs. In short, while the first pee when beer drinking can be put off for a long time the next and all subsequent calls to pee are urgent. Once one has acknowledged the…</p>

        <p class="card-text">I&#039;d like to say up front that I am an ancient male who loves sightings and stories of females accidentally wetting themselves. However, such incidents have necessarily had to be incidents of pure accident in order to arouse me. I have never thought I would be aroused by purposeful wetting accidents on the part of females. But then, I never considered it possible that a female would wet herself on purpose.
Male wettings whether accidental or not has never entered my mind as a means of sexual arousal, only as a matter of curiosity. 
As an ancient male I have had occasion to witness many female struggles with full bladders and I have witnessed many females who have lost those struggles. Although not nearly as…</p>

I was sitting on the patio with my girlfriend Faith. It was a sunny Sunday afternoon and we&#039;d just finished tea. &quot;How much do you love me?&quot; I asked.
Faith looked up from her magazine with a puzzled expression on her face. &quot;Why?&quot;
&quot;Just wondered what you&#039;d do to prove how much you love me,&quot; I replied.
She pushed a stray strand of her black hair away from her face. &quot;Why?&quot;
&quot;Don&#039;t look so worried. It&#039;s just that I finished reading a book this morning.&quot;
&quot;Congratulations. Give yourself a Gold Star. But I still don&#039;t see how your finishing a book leads to that question.&quot;

        <p class="card-text">So, I left you with my last experience with Casey. We had finally got a couple of things out in the open. She knew how turned on I was at the sight of her desperation. I knew how much she wanted to see me in a similar situation. 
A week or so after my experience with her she was hanging out at my apartment when somehow the topic came up. Casey expressed the interest of getting me into a situation where she could get me desperate to go. She said the ultimate goal was to see me soak myself. I was a bit turned on by the idea. I have previously written about a situation I had with a good friend of mine, Brooke, last Christmas when we had both wet ourselves. That turned into a pretty orgasmic situation. So I knew…</p>

It had been a really lovely day. We&#039;d been camping for almost a week and Des and I were so close it was perfect! We shared everything, told each other everything – a magical relationship, in fact.
We&#039;d been together for about two years, and once – and only once – I&#039;d told him how I felt about getting desperate to pee. He&#039;d taken it well; excited even – but I&#039;ll tell that story another time!
