        <p class="card-text">It was one of those days where I just felt randy, and it was about 4 in the afternoon. Time to get the mail. I went to the mailbox at my apartment complex, when I saw the prettiest girl walking along to the entrance door of my building. She was wearing a denim mini and a cute pink short sleeved shirt, so right away my mind began dancing with the idea of how lovely it would be to have a little of my kind of fun with her. As I thought of this, standing there at the mailbox, I let just a tiny dribble go in my pink boy cut panties, making sure none showed through my jeans.
I headed back to the apartment, and who was standing at the door to my neighbors but the pretty girl. She was kind of dancing about strangely …</p>

        <p class="card-text">Patty Richardson checked herself for the third time – ok, she had to admit that she really looked good. Her breasts flirted with the thin silky material of her blouse, tight against her nipples. She had no need of a bra and she liked the looks she got without one. Her long shapely legs looked even more remarkable under the tight mini. Her panties played peek–a–boo with her as she turned in the mirror, her perfect ass occasionally visible under the dress as she moved. Pretty short! She decided it was just right. The 28–year–old single mother worked long hours as a social worker and the mental anguish of the job often left her numb, but tonight was girls&#039; night out. She allowed herself this luxury about once a…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Prince Kadrid stood at the silk–draped doorway to his royal harem, smiling at the sight of almost two dozen women from around the world, dressed in sheer dresses and skirts, lounging in the gorgeous rooms in the tropical sunlight. Holding back the silks, he entered, pulling behind him the new visitor to the palace, Darren, a tall, muscular man with a dark tan and short hair. Darren was a distinguished quest, and therefore was to have a pair of women for the night. Darren gaped at all of the women, and slowly walked around the rooms to find the ones he liked best. Finally, Darren pointed at two slender, tall women who were among a group talking softly together on the patio, sipping at tall pink lemonades. Cara…</p>

        <p class="card-text">At the time it seemed the logical thing to do – but trying to persuade my wife was another matter!
We had been at the beach for a few hours already and after a couple of bottles of cool water, we both needed to pee badly. Trouble is, my wife isn&#039;t one for peeing in public – even in the sea – so she sat there fidgeting while we discussed what to do. There were basically three options. One – she could go into the sea and pee while pretending to swim or paddle or whatever it is people do when they pee in the sea. Two – we could leave the beach, return to the car and find a rest area nearby that had toilet facilities. Or three – she could pee where she was, sitting next to me, onto the towel that was still damp…</p>

        <p class="card-text">This story is fictional.
The doorbell rang and I knew it was the UPS delivery I had been expecting. I opened the door and was greeted by a rather pleasant looking female delivery driver. She smiled at me in a slightly nervous sort of way and let out a bit of a groan as she set down the rather large box of parts I had ordered for my Alfa Romeo Spider. She straightened up and still seemed a bit fidgety, as she held out her electronic clipboard for my signature.
At this point, I took a better look at her. She was about 5&#039;7&quot;, with long dark hair and sunglasses on. Being the better part of August, it was already at least 80–degrees outside and she was wearing her &#039;standard issue&#039; brown short sleeve shirt and…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Officer Jim Collins has been on traffic patrol for 7 years now and is pretty sure he has seen it all...except what he wants to see. He has heard the other traffic officers discuss seeing it from time to time, and has tried to get details without being &quot;too&quot; interested. His former patrol partner had pulled over a lady just last month for weaving in traffic. She had been about 28, pretty, and very drunk. She had gotten out of her car and flooded her panties while trying to walk a straight line. Jim had seen her at the station, but he could see nothing of her wetness; her dress had remained dry and he didn&#039;t think it would be wise to request a peek. Jim wants to see a genuine wet accident. He wants to pull over a…</p>

The beaches never emptied entirely on their island. Through her sunglasses, Rosemary looked up from her novel and admired the sunset. Another long, slow, beautiful day in paradise was coming to a close, and after nearly ten years she was finally beyond the too good to be true stage. It was true. She really lived here, and she really was a hero for the very reason she&#039;d been ostracized back home. She set the book down on her lap and pondered that thought once again.
Naturally, since she&#039;d stopped concentrating on the book, it wasn&#039;t long before Rosemary&#039;s attention…</p>

Michael snuck up behind her and poked her lightly on the bottom. She spun around and her grabbed her in his arms. Chloe was breathless with anticipation of being kissed right then and there, but when the ticket–lady, some old prude wearing a silly fez hat cleared her throat, the couple deposited their money, grabbed their tickets and entered the brightly lit, spinning, colorful fair. It was a little corny as always, but they were two teenagers ready to have fun. Michael absolutely loved Chloe&#039;s outfit. It was sexy, but not sluttish.

And since they were afraid of what the other might think about their secrets... It took quite a while for them to come out in the open. It all started on a cool Friday night.

        <p class="card-text">This is a story about my fianc&#039;, Eric and myself. We both have quite the wetting fetish and although this is a fictional story, similar things have happened to us before. Enjoy!
I knew there would definitely be some wetness that day because the traffic report warned of delays due to road construction on the highway. Before heading out we filled a cooler with bottles of water, cans of coke, and a few bottles of juice and iced tea since it was a rather hot day. Eric and myself are both freaks about staying hydrated and even if we have to go on a long road trip we don&#039;t hold off on the fluids. It&#039;s simply uncomfortable to be thirsty, and if it&#039;s only the two of us on the trip a little moisture never hurt anyone …</p>

        <p class="card-text">For the past 2 years I have been surfing around on the Internet in the search of real desperation and sometimes I have gotten in touch with girls who like it too.
On one particular day I was busy reading and writing a lot of SMS messages using my mobile phone with a nice girl who was very curious about my actual situation.
So, after work I decided to go to a bar (pub) to meet friends and to drink some beers. After a while I had to pee but decided not to go to the bathroom and thought that I would try to leave the bar at the point where I could just imagine making it all the way home.
I always take the train and the bus to go to work and that day wasn&#039;t any different. It was evening and beginning to get dark…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Our Date ( For the Guys )
The strong smell of chlorine fills the air. The concrete walls echo with the screaming of children, teens and nervous parents. It&#039;s two o&#039;clock and my shift is over. I survey the scene on this busy Saturday; take the empty water bottle with me as my replacement shows up. As I climb down the ladder from the watch chair I&#039;m aware how badly I need to use the bathroom. No breaks today, another lifeguard called in sick, and it&#039;s been four hours without a pee break, and with as much water as I had, I&#039;m about to burst. My red lifeguard bathing suit fits tightly over my 5&#039; 6&quot; body, my long dark hair tied up in a bun. I fidget as I sign out, the tight fabric of my bathing suit clinging to my…</p>

        <p class="card-text">&#039;Life is good,&#039; thought Bill Williams as he cruised down the freeway. The college girls in the red convertible had slowed alongside his service van, allowing him a good look at their bikini clad bodies as they headed for a day at the beach. He was pretty sure the redhead had to pee, at least that&#039;s what she said to her friend who was driving. Bill really liked girls who needed to pee. The way she had been wriggling on the seat, he believed her! Bill worked all over Southern California doing bank maintenance for a national company. The job offered varied scenery, good pay and freedom in scheduling his time. The fringe benefits of driving the Southern California freeways had to be seen to be believed. He had…</p>

We apologize if we have been unable to reply to you personally since by publishing our e–mail address we have attracted a spate of adverts to make big willies or illicit CDs or see pictures of naughty women and we delete these. Some of your replies may have been amongst the twenty or so we now get each week.
Second– we must also apologize to those who have taken all of our tales as complete truth. In order to join them together we have had to fabricate some sections but each one has a kernel of what really happened. Our children are not really called Stanley and Hilda; neither are we Robert and May. I hope we are forgiven for this…</p>

They&#039;ll be asleep for the next two hours and he will almost certainly sit beside them watching them breathe. He has proved himself an expert nappy changer, claiming to have practiced on me though we&#039;ve never tried the adult baby route. Some might say we&#039;ve been babyish throughout our time together. Whatever the case it&#039;s all got to come to a halt for now so I&#039;ve decided to set down some of the things about Robert and his ways that might intrigue your readers.
