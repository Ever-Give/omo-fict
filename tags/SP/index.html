Things were going well between Tanja and me. I was madly in love with her and I could feel that she had a growing liking to me as well. We did have our differences though. I wanted nothing more than to be with Tanja all the time. She was absolutely amazing in every way. She was the woman I had only seen in my dreams until now.
However, Tanja was more non–committal and tended to shy away from any discussions of getting to know each other better. She seemed to want to keep her options open and rolled with life as it came, taking in all of each and every experience. I had told her that I was okay with…</p>

        <p class="card-text">My partner and I were invited to an Old Skool rave at a friend&#039;s house last weekend. She had not initially understood the invite fully. It was obvious to me but although Val&#039;s English is excellent, it is not her first language and there are subtle cultural differences, which had eluded her. I realised that it was going to be predominantly 90&#039;s music but it was also going to be fancy dress. We were expected to go in school uniform or at least something that would pass as that.
Val was quite surprised. She has never really got her head round this schoolgirl nightclub thing. She feels that there is something odd about young women dressing as provocative schoolgirls, especially as she says the English are so…</p>

        <p class="card-text">The first day Mr. Thompson posted the Help Wanted – Part Time sign in his window Jenny came in. He had run his small jewelry store by himself since he opened a year ago, but business had picked up and he decided to get someone part time to help out. He thought Jenny was so cute but too young. She had a pretty smile and long blonde hair and a tiny sexy body. And she was wearing a cheerleader uniform.
&quot;Hello Mr. Thompson, I am Jenny. Amanda told me you needed somebody part time.&quot;
&quot;My daughter, Amanda?&quot;
&quot;Yes Sir, we are in the same class at school.&quot;

        <p class="card-text">The sunlight shone in from the east, filtering through the white curtains, casting patterns upon the hardwood floor of the upstairs bedroom. The window was open, the cool morning breeze wafting gently throughout the room, birds chirping as the new day began. Next to the window, to the left, stood a cabinet, filled with picture frames and mementos. On top of the cabinet sat an old alarm clock, manual wind, a worn cell phone, and a hairbrush. A few bobby pins lay next to the hairbrush, along with a torn piece of paper with a phone number on it. To the right of the window there was open space; only a faded picture of an old Elle magazine cover hung sloppily in a cheap frame. Within the wall to the right of the…</p>

Bronwyn (name altered) and myself shared the same classes from third thru seventh period. We were very close and enjoyed all the things one gets up to at that age, dating, flirting, sports and in our case living dangerously – smoking in school uniform. If you were caught, you soon felt it.
By the time our senior year class group reached the seventh form, Bronwyn and myself shared a very close bond. We could confide in anything to each other even though by then all I wanted to do was to get her naked. I wasn&#039;t the only…</p>

She had made this, her third desperation party, a fancy dress school disco themed party and it was so good to see everyone really getting into the spirit of it. Lucy was wearing a short blue pleated skirt, which was now bunched firmly between her legs, and her blonde pigtails and pained expression really completed the effect.

She was bored of doing dishes every day and had wanted more excitement in her life, so her husband suggested joining the local swingers club. She was intrigued, but she hadn&#039;t quite expected this. The meal had gone down great. She had cooked a grand feast for George her husband, and Tom and his wife Pat. There had been lots of wine on offer, which admittedly she had consumed quite heavily to calm her nerves.
Now her husband had whisked Pat up to the bedroom and Jennifer had been left handcuffed on the carpet. What&#039;s more she was beginning to wish…</p>

Head tilted back, eyes tight shut; she worked her fingers in slow orgasmic circles as she gently peed. The wetness, the excitement, and then the lounge door swung open and Hannah let out a great gush into her knickers in surprise.
