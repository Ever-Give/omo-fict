        <p class="card-text">It was in the fall of 1967 when Nancy found herself in the clutches of the State Police. She was demonstrating on the campus of her college when the demonstration turned violent. She wasn&#039;t aware of this fact and she continued to demonstrate just as she had been prepared to do by the leaders of the demonstration. She was still shouting what a great sham the college administration and the government of the United States was when the state police hustled her and several of her friends into a line where she and her friends would appear in front of a pair of officers who would determine whether Nancy and her friends would be detained or not.
Gathered into this queue, Nancy began to feel a bit uncomfortable. She…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Chloe was an 18–year–old girl, who was studying for her A levels at a very strict school in England. She lived with her 3 older brothers who were very highly sexed and loved seeing girls bursting for a pee. They also lived with her parents who knew nothing of their sons&#039; peculiar pastime and were very prim and proper. They would think that the sight of an 18 year old wetting her pants was an absolute disgrace, and could not even imagine that anyone could &#039;get off&#039; on such a thing.
Well one Friday evening the brothers decided that it would be amazing to contrive a plan, working together to make Chloe absolutely desperate for a pee, and then ultimately wee in her knickers in public.
When Monday morning came…</p>

We each had a full pitcher of beer and drank all of it. We ate a little and then we headed towards the bathroom because of recent problem that I had experienced. Jade said she did not need to go so I went by myself, peed quickly into the toilet and then left before even letting all of it out because we were in a hurry to get to the party, which was about an hour away There were BOYZ at the party. I got thirsty again and drank 4 more bottles of beer getting drunk. I knew that I was out of control but I finally sat down with a little help from Jade. She had also gotten…</p>

Usually, I am up, dressed; having my second cup of coffee and waiting on Margo by the time she arrives. However, the electricity went off sometime during the night and though my internal alarm went off early enough for me to take a quick shower, there wasn&#039;t enough time to fully enjoy a cup of coffee, much less a second cup. Maybe I could persuade Margo to stop somewhere before getting on the freeway.
Hurriedly, tip–toeing in stocking feet across cold concrete with heels in hand, I glanced up to realize someone else was in the car with…</p>

        <p class="card-text">The fog was lifting from the skyline, the fir trees outlined against the hazy early–morning sky. The far window in the room was open, the fresh smell of pine needles and the pure mountain air wafting through the small room. The dormitory was eerily silent at this hour, the sun was just coming up and most of the dorm&#039;s inhabitants were still cozily in bed, sleeping. Elizabeth got up out of her bed, quietly stretched her limber arms to the ceiling, trying not to wake her roommate. She yawned and looking at the clock on her makeshift desk, pulled off her pink underwear and lavender nightshirt and stumbled sleepily into the shower. Her roommate lay in bed, still asleep while Elizabeth started her day. Towel…</p>

Upon arriving at the party, we were both thirsty so we drank three bottles of beer apiece, along with five cups of lemonade. Michelle finally arrived and she drank another four bottles of beer. We were there for a total of two hours before we left to embark upon our camping trip. Everyone needed to use the restroom but it was so messy that we decided not to use it. Then we left.
Julie, our driver, told us it would take an hour to get to the camping spot as long as there wasn&#039;t a traffic problem. That sounded fine, we…</p>

Normally we finish at three o&#039;clock but that day we had to stay until four thirty in the afternoon.
It started off like any other day with our teacher, Ms. Jorgenson drinking her two cups of coffee. That day we had her the entire day as our teacher. After finishing her coffee, she started to teach, and then went outside for more coffee. She filled a thermos with three more cups of coffee and brought it back to class to drink while teaching.
At lunchtime, we were forced to eat inside due to rain, though some of us left in cars to go home or to…</p>

For those adventurous souls who download it – I trust you enjoy it.
Some years ago, when I lived in a city called Johannesburg, I was in an outdoor shop buying some kit for a short trip into the sticks, when a small group of British tourists entered and were chatting about sunscreens, hats and the like.

Picked a pair of black tights, a very short plaid miniskirt and a black long sleeve top. She skipped the bra; 34A wasn&#039;t going to get anyone&#039;s attention, and she hated the things anyway.

Making my way to the ladies&#039; room I saw them, three girls standing in the hall, their uniforms the same as mine, but that&#039;s where the similarity ended. My name is Mary. I attended my local school, but even at 18 I was still being bullied– by Heather and her two cronies.
I had refused to give them any money or CDs and they wanted to push me. Heather called me over and I went timidly pulling my blazer over my dark blue pleated skirt (ballerina length) and white blouse.
Suddenly I had a thought. Anything is better than the insults and pain so I increased my leg…</p>

        <p class="card-text">When I went to high school, students respected their teachers a little more, and as a general rule did as they were told when the teachers were looking. Further more, we didn&#039;t have all of these long breaks between classes. We had exactly five minutes between classes to do our personal business whether that was getting to the next class, meeting with our friends briefly, going to our locker to change books, or using the bathroom. Well, I remember that our school was a large one, and my PE class was on one side of the school while my Science class was on the other side and upstairs! To make matters worse, sometimes teachers had the right to hold an entire class after the bell for two minutes if that class was…</p>

        <p class="card-text">I last left you with the story of my threesome with my neighbor Casey and her gorgeous friend Kendra. Casey and I had made a plan with the intention of making Kendra have an accident along with us. Our plan was almost successful, except that Kendra found a trashcan at the last second and used it as a toilet. I didn&#039;t even get to watch her unleash her flow, as she ran into another room. Nevertheless, Casey and I both had our intentional accidents and enjoyed a night long of sex with Kendra. It was amazing. (If you have no idea what I am talking about please read my previous story)
About three weeks passed when I got a call from Kendra. I totally didn&#039;t even expect to hear from her again, unless I ran into her…</p>

        <p class="card-text">This is a true story– as are all of my stories. The outcome of this incident was unplanned. Due to the nature of this story, I strongly urge the readers NOT to try this themselves. There is an inherent danger for those that are untrained that could cause long lasting damage and have legal implications.
As with almost everyone I went to college with, I had a minor that I pursued. It was in psychology. I had not intended to minor in psychology, but by chance, my psychology 101 instructor happened to be a renowned expert in the field of behavioral psychology. His lectures were interesting and I found myself very interested in his work. He was conducting several clinical studies on campus and I found myself…</p>

        <p class="card-text">It was 4:10. Jessica knew that she couldn&#039;t be late coming home today. She was already grounded for sneaking her boyfriend into her room the night before, and if she was late today her mother would surely add more time to her punishment. She hustled to make the 4:15 bus even though she was a 10–minute walk from the bus stop. She walked taking very quick steps, hoping that she would make it just as the bus pulled up. Time seemed to pass faster, and she didn&#039;t seem to be reaching her destination quickly enough. She started to run for the bus stop through the cold air. The first day of fall and it was 55 degrees. Far too cold for the thin jacket and stretch jeans she had chosen to wear. As she made it to the bus…</p>
