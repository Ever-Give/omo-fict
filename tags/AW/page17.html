        <p class="card-text">Anne&#039;s fingers flew across the keyboard at a rate of knots. Sally, her colleague, was on holiday in Cromer and so instead of working her usual three mornings, she&#039;d been asked to put in a full five–day week. Clive, her boss, was throwing work at her from all directions and it was proving difficult to keep up, let alone maintain a sense of composure. She paused momentarily, draining the last drops of coffee in her cup – the fourth she&#039;d had that morning. Excessive though it was, she needed all those infusions of caffeine, a necessity just enabling her to keep going, especially as the week was ending and fatigue was starting to set in.
Looking at her watch she noticed that it was ten past twelve. Another five…</p>

        <p class="card-text">This is a true story of a sighting I had of a girl my age (18) when I was in my senior year of high school.
We had weekly assemblies, all standing in the open assembly area, just before lunchtime. My mates and I usually tried to stand behind a row of girls so we could check them out. I particularly enjoyed studying the shape of their bottoms under their uniforms and imagining I could see right through to their pants. One day in an assembly I found myself particularly transfixed by an extremely attractive girl in front and just across to the left. She was fairly new to the school and just perfect – not too skinny but not fat; solid, athletic looking legs that went &quot;all the way up&quot; before disappearing under the…</p>

Kristine had two fingers pressing on the track&#039;s hard surface, her other arm cocked at her left side. Her Nike track shoes were pressed against the starting blocks, white socks barely showing above the edge of the shoe line, her calve muscles taut, her perfectly shaped, sleek yet athletic thighs tensed as she awaited the starting gunshot. A slight sheen of perspiration shone on her legs and arms. A single drop of perspiration fell from her nose, falling to the tracks surface, a small dark circle where it fell. Crouched in starting stance, her face stared down the straightaway of the track, her butt sticking up in the air, her short green nylon…</p>

But today I needed to buy some clothes so I found myself in a mall. There was a sale going on and I wanted to get a couple of blouses and a skirt that had been advertised, so I first went to get them, but when I got to the car with my purchases I decided there was no reason to head for home and I might as well take a wander around.
I must have spent an hour or so wandering up and down the mall, checking out different stores and finally stopping to get a cup of coffee. For a while I just sat and watched the people go by, wondering about their stories and making up stories to go with their…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Kari was a beautiful young girl just out of high school. She had always been incredibly shy, but her smile more than made up for it. After moving away to college she desperately needed a job to pay her bills, but in a college town, jobs can be hard to come by. She wore a tight fitting red blouse, tight khaki pants, and white cotton panties.
After a long day of tedious interviews, Kari was walking back to her dorm when she realized she had far too much to drink on her lunch break. Being new in town she did not know of anywhere she could just stop in to use the rest room, plus she figured, &quot;I&#039;m a grown adult, I&#039;ll be fine.&quot;

Now I know I&#039;m not the only secretly weird one; I had no idea there is so many others fascinated by pissing! I can&#039;t say the idea of golden showers or shitting holds any appeal for me, but I&#039;ve always been turned on by someone genuinely busting for a pee, preferably with plenty of dramatics, and also enjoy the odd bit of showing off of my own.

Jenny needed to pee. It wasn&#039;t an extremely urgent need (at least not yet, anyway), but it was enough to cause her some discomfort. She had been bagging groceries nonstop for the past 2 1/2 hours, and it wasn&#039;t even an hour and fifteen minutes into her shift that she began to feel that familiar sensation of painful pressure weighing down on her urethra. Jenny was an attractive Caucasian girl, with a slim body and shoulder–length dark blonde hair. But now her cute face was beginning to show the strain caused by the increasing heaviness in her bladder.
A customer noticed her furrowed brow and pursed lips and asked her if there was anything wrong.

        <p class="card-text">Jennifer struggled against her bonds, but there was no escape. Sweating slightly from her excursions she lay there, panting and stared up from her living room floor. She was bored of doing dishes every day and had wanted more excitement in her life, so her husband suggested joining the local swingers club. She was intrigued, but she hadn&#039;t quite expected this. The meal had gone down great. She had cooked a grand feast for George her husband, and Tom and his wife Pat. There had been lots of wine on offer, which admittedly she had consumed quite heavily to calm her nerves.
Now her husband had whisked Pat up to the bedroom and Jennifer had been left handcuffed on the carpet. What&#039;s more she was beginning to wish…</p>

        <p class="card-text">It started out as a normal night, that evening a friend and I had pitched a tent in our back yard and were preparing for a sleepover/campout. Little did we know we would enter the tent as innocent girls and leave completely changed.
Early in the evening we busied ourselves with making s&#039;mores and popcorn, watching a movie or two, and gossiping about all kinds of things that interest teenagers. After calling up a few of our friends to chat we were getting pretty tired. It was only ten o&#039; clock though, so we decided to stay up a while longer. &quot;Well, we can start pitching the tent,&quot; I told my friend. Once that was done we set up our sleeping bags and got ready for a good, &quot;warm&quot; night. After staying in the tent…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Vickie left her family&#039;s residence and her boyfriend in Philadelphia around 11:00 PM on Sunday. She was in route to Virginia Beach and she traveled down the eastern shore to get there. Traveling that late at night does not afford one a sufficient number of rest stops, and it was a very long drive. Vickie (a city girl) was still reluctant to bare her bottom to relieve herself even if she was to be covered by dense woodlands. As a matter of fact the denser the woods the more reluctant she was.
So, she was determined to make the entire six–hour trip without a bathroom break. She had never driven this far before so she wasn&#039;t quite sure what she was getting into. However, when she set out she was feeling good and…</p>

        <p class="card-text">This is another little vignette that takes place in ca 1930 at the vast, pastoral estate in England known as Bish Manor.
We begin with Derrick, a tall, thin, respectable no–nonsense type. He was a handsome gentleman, and was avidly involved in the social circles, attended all the parties, and kept himself at all times blithe and charming. After all, one never knew where one&#039;s future fianc&#039;e might be lurking, and marrying well was an object most sought after by his crowd.
He thereby began his day, an outing to Bish Manor, with a bright and innocent temperament. There was nothing more on his mind but than to get nicely sloshed, play a little cricket outdoors with the fellows, have a good cigar and do a spot of…</p>
