When I was eighteen, I spent four weeks in hospital after falling off a roof and breaking both arms, dislocating one and giving my back a nasty jolt. I spent quite a lot of this time with my arms encased in itchy plaster and suspended by wires to prevent me from moving them. I was lucky that my father had the kind of job that offered good medical cover, and I had a private room. To be honest, I would rather have been in one of the wards with other kids my age so that I would have had people to talk to, but since the insurance company was paying, my dad wanted me to have the best.
The hospital boasted some very…</p>

        <p class="card-text">This was the day of one of the biggest meetings in the history of the Bell–Thomas accounting firm. All of the big shots in the company were there to discuss a possible merger with Orion Corporate Investments. Of course, this also meant that meticulous minutes of all the meetings would have to be taken. Carrie Stevens was the best secretary in the firm and she was the first one called up for this most important of meetings. She had charged up for the meeting with a tall iced mocha and she also had some Coke to give her the occasional boost during the meeting.
An hour and a half had gone by and the discussion was really starting to intensify. However, Carrie&#039;s need to relieve her bladder was starting to become…</p>

        <p class="card-text">It was one of those beach parties where everyone just assumes you know everybody else, so nobody ever bothers introducing you to anybody; but in reality you&#039;ve scarcely met anyone before in your life. It was originally intended as a small old chums&#039; get–together; but then friends started getting invited, and then friends of friends, and before we knew it there were close on two hundred people having a great time, eating lots of great food, and drinking lots of great drink. Most folk had brought rather more than a bottle and there was plenty to go around; so I just went with the flow and made the most of the opportunity to chill and enjoy myself.
The sun was setting, but there was still plenty of light. I was…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Trish gasped and slipped a hand between her legs. Her denim mini skirt was practically round her hips and Mark, sitting in the bus seat beside her with a protective arm around her shoulders, could have looked down and seen her knickers from crotch to waist had he wanted to. But he was too much of a gentleman, so he averted his eyes and tried to think of ways to help Trish hold on.
This was so not how Trish had wanted their first date to end. She had wanted to get to know Mark properly first, and then choose the right moment to tell him about her weak bladder and the problems it sometimes caused her. But now ... oh well, there was little point crying over spilt milk. She crossed her legs and clenched her thigh…</p>

He watches her openly, appreciatively, from across the park. She is awkward, appearing unfamiliar with her body. Even so, he likes the way she moves. There is something there. She is no teenager with a perfect body, but he knows she could and has looked much better. He senses her weight is a recent development. John Alden knows things about women. She sees him looking her way but cannot even muster the thought that he is looking at her or finds her in any way attractive. She assumes he is watching RudeDog&#039;s antics. He thinks she is probably in her mid thirties and he is correct. Jenny Donner is 37. He thinks she is…</p>

I had my heart set on Las Vegas–I thought the dry heat and sun would be invigorating. Well, that&#039;s what I said to my girlfriend. She wanted to go to Japan. She had taken an interest in the country and the culture from travel documentaries on TV, and recently she had begun taking lessons in speaking Japanese.
We decided to meet one evening after work to decide. We would discuss the matter over a few pale ales, persuading each other with pictures from brochures and well–reasoned arguments. She thought Vegas was tacky and decadent (exactly the point, I thought). I thought Japan would be too…</p>

        <p class="card-text">It was finally the end of the day on Friday and Nikki was more than ready for the weekend. It had been a rough week at work and Nikki was ready for two days of relaxation and time with Tyler. To prepare herself she had been drinking lots of water all afternoon. Of course, she had had to pee several times in order not to embarrass herself at the office, but that was OK. She knew she was well hydrated and that she now only needed to drink a little to fill her bladder enough to make her hot and intensify her horniness.
She stopped in the staff kitchen on her way out of the office to fill up her water bottle and then headed out to the car. On the way home she fantasized about what she might do with Tyler tonight.…</p>

Doctor Annabel Hart. The pretty young redhead&#039;s green eyes sparkled as she stared in amazement at the shingle hanging outside her office. She had thought, more than once, that this day would never come. Still, she had persevered, working long hours to support her schooling and even longer hours to pass medical school. The sleepless nights and heavy schedule had granted Annabel her most intense desire, but at the price of any social life. In fact she had no friends outside the stodgy little medical school she had attended. She thought it was worth it. Social opportunities would come when she…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Alyssa, Elizabeth and Michelle were three sisters from the oldest to the youngest, who had been chatting and drinking at a bar. The beers went by and the conversation was so interesting that they hadn&#039;t remembered to go to the bathroom, but finally they realised that their bladders were dangerously full. The first to notice it was the middle one.
Elizabeth: &quot;Girls, I&#039;ll be back in a minute, I need to use the toilet.&quot;
Michelle: &quot;Wait, I&#039;ll go with you, I need it too.&quot;
Alyssa: &quot;Hey, don&#039;t leave me here alone, you aren&#039;t the only ones that have several beers inside!&quot;
Elizabeth: &quot;Ok, but I called it first, so one of you&#039;ll have to wait here to watch our stuff while the other one comes with me.&quot;
Alyssa: …</p>

        <p class="card-text">Kristan enjoyed skiing. She and Brad were on their way to the ski resort and she couldn&#039;t be happier. She wore her skin–tight jeans because she knew that they drove Brad crazy. This was their first date, so Kristan was incredibly nervous. And when she gets nervous, she has accidents. Nevertheless, when Brad offered her some coffee to warm up on the way to the slopes, she accepted. When they got to the resort, Kristan began to feel the urge to pee. Brad was eager to hit the slopes though after the long 2–hour drive, so she agreed to take a few runs before going to the lodge.
She put on her skis and teetered her way to the lift. Brad held her hand as they slowly slid their way onto the bench. The seat came in…</p>

&quot;Shall I top that up for you, Em?&quot; Dave nodded towards Emma&#039;s half full pint glass, and held up a nearly full three–litre bottle of cider.
&quot;No, I&#039;m fine,&quot; Emma replied. &quot;I&#039;ve got to think about going soon or I&#039;ll miss the last train. But it&#039;s been a great party, Dave: really it has.&quot;
&quot;Last train&#039;s not for quarter of an hour yet,&quot; said Dave, checking his watch. &quot;It&#039;ll only take me a couple of minutes to run you down to the station in the car.&quot;
&quot;But you&#039;ve been drinking,&quot; Emma protested. &quot;I can walk it in ten minutes, so I&#039;ll be fine as long as I glug this down and make a start right away.&quot;

        <p class="card-text">The next few days went by rather uneventfully. Neither Carol nor I wanted to make a mistake in our relationship, so we were very, very cautious. In fact, aside from the fact that we continued to sleep in the same bed, our relationship went back to what it had been in the past. I had arrived on Saturday evening and all the big revelations had taken place before midnight Sunday.
While it was uneventful in terms of any wetting together or other sex play, we did get around a bit. We went swimming in Lake Coeur d&#039;Alene, borrowed a friend&#039;s sailboat for a day, spent one whole day shopping and Carol tried to teach me how to play golf – sorry, but that&#039;s just not going to happen! Through it all there was, for me at…</p>

I dumped Melissa and boy did she ever get revenge. I was out at a bar with my new girlfriend Kristan one night drinking. As usual, Kristan was decked out in her skin–tight stretch jeans with black boots and tank top. Her ass was unbelievable in her light, skin–tight jeans. There we were drinking and having a good time when I spotted Melissa across the bar. Melissa was about ten years older than me and we had dated about a year. It used to be a real turn on for me that she was around 40 and I was 30. I used to love the way she would dress – everything skin–tight. Tonight was no different. She looked hot wearing a pair of…</p>
