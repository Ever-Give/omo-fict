        <p class="card-text">Lisa walked into the room and saw Christy going through her purse. She turned around and handed Lisa two twenty–dollar bills. Lisa looked up at Christy confused and Christy smirked at her, saying, &quot;If you&#039;re going to be wetting your pants like a baby, then we need to treat you like one! I want you to go to the store and buy some diapers and a pacifier. Also buy a pair of handcuffs.&quot;
Lisa threw her arms in the air and looked down at her soaking wet jeans. Christy smiled and said, &quot;You&#039;re going just like you are now.&quot; She looked up at the clock. &quot;Hurry, baby, I&#039;m timing you.&quot; Christy lay on the couch and turned on the television. Lisa, red faced as ever, thought about telling Christy to go to hell, but in the…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Victoria Gray smoothed down the skirt of her Armani dress, anxious that it should not wrinkle. She wanted to look every bit the $500 it had cost. It looked marvellous on her tall, willowy form, and she knew it. The choice made specifically for her performance evaluation that afternoon, looked smart, professional, and elegant, a garment to suit board members from the highly conservative to the outright lascivious.
Victoria knew she was a hot contender for promotion to Assistant Regional Director of Highline Apparel, probably the fastest growing quality fashion chain on the east coast. She needed to look the part if she was going to go places within the company.

        <p class="card-text">I was driving home from the office. I was alone in the car, and suddenly the traffic slowed and came to an abrupt halt. For the next half hour we started, crawled, and stopped, covering about half a mile. Up ahead there was a bus stop and about twenty folk waiting. I glanced in the mirrors and could see no bus behind me. I felt sorry for them because I guessed they&#039;d got a fair wait ahead of them. As I looked at them I noticed one, a dark haired lady in her twenties jogging up and down. Suddenly her hand went between her legs and she bent forwards at the waist, bending her knees. Slowly she straightened up and seemed to regain control, but then she went into a pee dance, hopping rapidly from one foot to the…</p>

        <p class="card-text">The other day I was at the public park when I saw two girls in their twenties showing clear signals of being desperate to pee. That&#039;s not unusual here. During these beautiful warm days women go out to enjoy the sun, and since it&#039;s hot outside they drink a lot of water that ends up in their bladders. Since there are just a few public toilets around, it&#039;s usual to see girls in different stages of desperation, or squatting behind a tree or a bush, or even once in a while peeing themselves, just a little or completely, while waiting in line for the toilet.
What&#039;s odd about these two is to see them so desperate this early, when it&#039;s not even noon. Usually the best sightings are in the afternoon, after lunch,…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Ellen was a colleague of mine at a large advertising agency. She and I were competing for the same promotion. The bosses at the agency made it clear that the winner got the job, and the loser had to leave.
Ellen is a bright and attractive woman in her late 30&#039;s who was completely driven by work and success. So far as anyone knew, she had no private life. Her dress was stylish, but her in–office demeanor very prim. Ellen also never admitted mistake, nor showed any remorse. Her goal was to succeed by any means necessary. We did not work together, and our relationship was limited to saying hello to one another in the hallways.
For six solid months Ellen and I competed for the coveted vice–president&#039;s position.…</p>

Oh how I love this. Figured it was a good time to introduce myself. I&#039;m a closet case. Twenty years old and my boyfriend doesn&#039;t know a thing about this little obsession of mine. I am very secretive about it. But I feel like sharing this bit of myself with you.

The problem, though, is that from time to time a girl floats into the life that thinks the city stinks and the country is where it&#039;s at. Whereas, of course, as far as I&#039;m concerned it&#039;s the country that stinks (literally, in many cases: I mean, have you ever actually smelled a pig farm or a stable yard?) and the city is where it&#039;s really at.

There was one incident where it could have gotten me into a ton of trouble both with my parents and the owners of an appliance store. Let me explain.
Our refrigerator had broke, or was in the process of breaking so my parents decided to go shop for a new one after dinner. Now for some reason I had to come along. It was summer at the time, so I really can&#039;t think of a reason I would have been tagging along for something so boring.

Then we&#039;d nestled down all snug in our bed, While visions of sexy accidents danced in our heads;
And mamma in her panties and I in my cap, Had just settled in, but for much more than a winter&#039;s nap;
When out on the lawn there arose such a clatter, Our hands sprang to our pants stop the leaking from our bladders;
Away to the window we flew like a flash, And stood crossing our legs while we threw up the sash;
The moon on my wife&#039;s breasts, which were as white as snow, Gave the…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Lisa woke up nervous today, because today wasn&#039;t just another day. First of all, let me tell you about Lisa. She&#039;s very pretty, long tanned legs, tight ass, 36C cup, and sexy brunette hair to match her cute brown eyes. She&#039;s also very bisexual; she may even prefer girls to guys. And for the past few months she&#039;s been toying over the Internet, getting interested in the idea of being dominant and having a submissive girl. And today was the day she was going to meet the girl she had been talking with for those few months. From the pictures she saw, Christy is a feisty redhead girl with shoulder length curly hair who is athletic and has perky tits.
Lisa stretched and enjoyed the sun sparkling over her nude body…</p>

        <p class="card-text">I guess I&#039;m just too much of a yoga natural for my own good! One moment I was in the classical lotus position, emptying my mind of all worldly distractions – the next I was sitting in a pool of wetness, my all too frail bladder having emptied itself in my knickers as I approached nirvana. Which ordinarily would not have mattered – I was completely relaxed (which is why I hadn&#039;t noticed I was having an accident until it was too late) and the warmth around my nether regions was simply lovely – except that I was in a public class and had the growing suspicion that if I didn&#039;t move soon the puddle spreading from under my bottom would become a major &#039;worldly distraction&#039; and source of public disgrace!

        <p class="card-text">The Rugby International (revisited)
As a divorcee of 30, Lindsay was flattered when one of the younger men at work asked her to join a group of his friends going to the rugby match. The group consisted of two other couples who were all in their 20&#039;s. The other two girls were Tracy, about 25, slim with dark hair and thick glasses, which spoiled her looks, and Belinda, well built, a blonde about 28. Both were casually dressed, Tracy in the tightest pair of jeans you could imagine, and Belinda in a denim mini–skirt, which was both short and tight. Lindsay had also gone for the casual look, wearing jeans, not as tight as Tracy&#039;s with a sweater and anorak. As you might expect from a rugby crowd, they met in a pub…</p>

        <p class="card-text">It was another boring day, as always, 25–year–old Victoria thought as she sat on the edge of her bed. She sat there, letting the warm sun soak her through the windows, glistening on her tight, tan body. She ran her hand over her rock hard abs and smiled as she looked down at herself. She loved her body and she loved the attention it got. She didn&#039;t have a boyfriend but she loved fucking a different guy every night. She knew she was a total slut and didn&#039;t care. She sat there thinking how it was Thursday, wishing it were Friday so she could go clubbing. It wasn&#039;t worth going on Thursday nights, though; the clubs weren&#039;t even half packed.
Finally, she got off the bed and walked to the window in her light green…</p>

        <p class="card-text">She rapped loudly at the door. &quot;What&#039;s taking so long? Get out already!&quot;
I was mildly annoyed. What was this woman&#039;s problem? It was Marie&#039;s voice, I realized. That particular co–worker of mine was a little uptight – especially since she lost that weight – but I brushed it off and figured she was just cranky. This was a bit much, though. I had only been in the bathroom for a minute.
&quot;Can&#039;t a girl pee in peace?&quot; I said loudly, my bladder leisurely emptying.
&quot;HURRY UP!&quot; she almost shouted. &quot;You&#039;re such a selfish pig! Don&#039;t you realize you&#039;re not the only female who pees in this office?&quot;
Now I was mad. True there was only one bathroom for each gender but gosh she didn&#039;t have to talk like that. I finished,…</p>
