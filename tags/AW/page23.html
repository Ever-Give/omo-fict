This was the day that Kameron was supposed to catch the 9:30 flight to Orlando, Florida. The previous night, she partied hard with some friends, so she hadn&#039;t even packed yet.&quot;Calm down, Kameron!&quot; she mumbled to herself as she searched for her, &quot;Travel Checklist.&quot; It was a default checklist that she always made out whenever she was traveling. It had all of the basic things that she would need to bring along on the trip. Kameron spotted the checklist hanging up on her refrigerator. She opened the fridge and took out her 32–ounce bottle of Aquafina, as she eyed the checklist quickly. She drank a huge gulp and then began to…</p>

        <p class="card-text">We were watching two 3–year–old girls. It was a hot summer day so we (my friend and I) had each had three 22 OZ. cokes. About half an hour later I began to feel the urge to pee. I ignored it and figured we would be leaving soon. About 45 minutes later my urge was getting to a state of emergency so I figured we had better get going. I told the two girls it was time to go and they started crying and begging to stay. Marcy, my friend, said, &quot;Oh come on just let them play a bit more!&quot; I figured I&#039;d wait.
Another 20 minutes went by. I was in urgent need now of a place to pee. I knew that even if we left then with the walking speed of those kids we wouldn&#039;t be home for at least 30 minutes. It was a last resort, but…</p>

So, I&#039;m sitting here on my day off doing absolutely nothing. Well, not nothing...I&#039;m listening to music and looking at dirty pictures on the Internet. A pastime I don&#039;t tell anyone about. I also have a very full bladder...another hobby I don&#039;t tell anyone about.
I am so wet right now that my pants are damp, although I haven&#039;t actually lost control yet. Really, I&#039;ve never gotten that far. Whether it&#039;s from fear, boredom, or intolerance to pain, I don&#039;t know, but I&#039;ve tried countless times. I always end up giving in and getting on the toilet. Maybe this time...
While I was living with John I discovered this odd (?) fetish of mine. He was telling me a story. It goes something…</p>

        <p class="card-text">A few weeks ago, my class went to a factory for germs and such things in Vienna. We went there by bus, and the ride took about 3 hours. In the bus, I was sitting next to Anna, and with about 30 minutes left in the ride, I was beginning to catch first signs of growing desperation. First she was just sitting cross–legged, but soon she started to move them against each other and banging her knees. After a while, she started to look very distressed and I asked her if she was OK. She said: &quot;Yeah, I just have to go to the toilet real bad. I hope we get there soon.&quot; This really got my attention. She continued to wiggle her legs around, and it seemed that her need was growing, as when we where nearly there, she…</p>

        <p class="card-text">This story is based on something that happened in a ballet class I used to take. It was the first time I had witnessed a major accident by another girl who wasn&#039;t a child and I found the experience incredibly interesting.
Emily rushed into the house, running late after spending too much time with her friends that morning. It was nearing noon, but there was no time for lunch as she had to rush off to ballet class in a few minutes. Thirsty more than hungry, Emily hurriedly downed a bottle of water and ate an apple, while Mom reminded her that she was running late for class. Emily had just been promoted to a trainee with the ballet company, and the rules were strict. If you missed just one class or were late…</p>

        <p class="card-text">&quot;Can we go to the mall tonight?&quot; Kelli asked. &quot;Sure, I guess.&quot; Meg replied, figuring anything was better than sitting around the house. Being a companion/tutor (babysitter?) was boring, but Meg needed the money. Grad School was expensive, and Kelli&#039;s parents paid better than anyone else she had worked for. Meg couldn&#039;t figure out why she really needed a companion. Kelli was a senior, she thought, and should have plenty of friends for companionship; although her small size fooled many into thinking she was younger. But hell, Meg thought, Kelli was a serious hottie. Good thing her parents didn&#039;t know of Meg&#039;s sexual preferences, she thought. And tonight Kelli looked pretty good, dressed in a pair of very tight…</p>

I know that sounds evil, but it has become such a turn on for me. A couple of weeks back one of my plans worked out better than I had thought it would.

I replied that I had not much in mind but suggested that maybe we could catch a movie or something. She sounded interested and asked me to call her with plans.

JANE&#039;S REVENGE Jane and her mum were staying with her aunt and her daughter Katie for a short holiday. Jane had arrived suffering from a bladder complaint that left her with feeble control of her bladder and inclined toward having accidents. Her embarrassing state would be made worse if any sexual stimulation were indulged in; as it inevitably delayed the time it would take for the complaint to get better. Unfortunately, the medication that Jane was taking had a side effect that caused such vaginal irritation it drove Jane to near nymphomania. To make matters worse, the doctor had Jane fitted with a panty girdle that acted like a chastity belt, to prevent scratching…</p>

Rebekah was, as usual, stuck in the back half of the plane in 20A, waiting with her body half in the aisle, half in the seats for the passengers in front of her to get off the arriving plane. The flight hadn&#039;t been too bad, a couple of hours in the air, no major problems. Rebekah wasn&#039;t terribly fond of flying, but nothing that a few drinks at the bar wouldn&#039;t help. After a few minutes of waiting, she got off the plane and walked up the airway to the gate area. She&#039;d been to NY before, but usually had driven; flying in was something new.
