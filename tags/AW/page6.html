Cindy quietly cursed each cup of coffee she had drunk on that cool, busy morning. It was almost 9 a.m. and the parade was about to begin. Her uncomfortably full bladder worried her. Could she hold on for the hour or more the parade would take before ending at a shopping center 2 miles away? 
&quot;Damn, damn, damn,&quot; she said under her breath while pressing her thighs together. &quot;And I don&#039;t even like coffee,&quot; she said ruefully.
The morning had not gone well. She had awakened at 5 a.m. with just four hours sleep after partying with friends the night before. She had a slight hangover and immediately gulped down a cup of coffee to get…</p>

Going on holiday to Cyprus was supposed to be so much fun! My friends, Alice and Barbara had talked me into the idea, but I had my doubts from the start.
&quot;Come on Janice, why don&#039;t you join us on holiday before we all go off to university! It will be great – promise you!&quot;
The first day was quite nice, exploring the coast, and lazing in the warm sun, but I found the evening hell! To be honest, I guess I was just not very good at mixing with people, and I really couldn&#039;t bear the idea of getting disgustingly drunk!
That first night we all three went into Paphos town and ended up at a big, noisy disco–bar…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Trisha was really cute but not innocent, she was also quite adventurous, mostly when it came to clothes. She drove the staff nuts at our school, skirts too short, shirts too little, bra less, but even so she had a way of not looking like a slut or a hooker. This had a lot to do with the fact that she wasn&#039;t either of those things but there was something about her. She was just a regular girl who wore what she wanted. The teachers, male and female, tried everything; sending her home to change and she would come back in a different crazy outfit, making her wear the school uniform, she would just cut it short. 
Even though she was 18 and a senior the staff felt that she shouldn&#039;t wear such things in high school.…</p>

        <p class="card-text">So far, I have been amazing lucky in my life, been to fabulous places and met fantastic people. My parents are quite wealthy and live near Milan. I always wanted to do ballet but grew too tall, and ended up making connections in fashion and modelling. So I travelled widely but my parents insisted that I get a good education as well.
By age 18 I was living mostly in a house in London run by chaperones who made sure that we were looked after and always ready to run off to shows and shoots. It was here that I had an unusual experience.
I was doing a shoot somewhere in the country and as the afternoon wore on. I really began to need the toilet. However, I was in and out of outfits, working quickly as the light…</p>

She has a slightly darker complexion than normal, but she is not an Asian or a black person (sorry if anyone interprets that as racist, I just want to make that part clear).

        <p class="card-text">I have always been interested in wet pants. It started when I was quite young, and I have never lost interest, even after 40 odd years!
I have wet myself more often than I can remember over the years. Sometimes fully peeing my knickers and making a puddle on the ground, but mostly just a bit wet, enough to show on tight jeans if you were looking for it! 
When I&#039;m feeling naughty though, I like to wait until the last possible minute to go to the loo. Most times I don&#039;t wet much, but I&#039;m often squirming and wriggling about trying not to pee myself, and doing the pee dance. I like the feeling of intense anticipation bordering on panic as I get towards not being able to wait much longer. Sometimes, particularly…</p>

Over the years, the wife and I have had a lot of wetting experiences with other parties and privately. We never wrote about these, choosing to be anonymous at her request. She&#039;s passed away now, and I&#039;m too old to be intimidated anymore so here it comes.
First of all, we determined there were TWO kinds of pee. Ordinarily the kidneys filter blood and send the waste to the bladder. This contains, among other things, acetic acid also known as vinegar, and this gives it the yellow tint you see. We called this DIRTY PEE.

My first experience with pee fun was when I was younger. I woke up at about 7am and lay there for a while as it was Saturday and I didn&#039;t have to be anywhere. After 5 minutes I was hit with a sudden urge to pee that made me cross my legs together under the sheets; however the urge went away as quickly as it came and I fell asleep again.
I woke again half an hour later by an even bigger urge to pee as I had ignored the first one. Carefully but quickly I climbed out of bed but as I stood up some pee squirted out, enough to make a large coin sized patch on my panties. I managed to stop the flow and…</p>

For one, she absolutely refused to use the porta potties at the concert, and now that they were sitting in the parking lot, waiting for the line of cars to move, she knew it would be a very long ride home.

When I got home after college Eve and Ann were waiting for me in the living room. They had put a blanket on the floor and told me I had to stand on it while I peed my jeans. I felt so turned on. I had just come home, with my coat and backpack still on and I could wet my pants now. I didn&#039;t hesitate, without taking anything off I stepped on the blanket and slightly spread my legs. Ann said something like, &#039;Oh my God, she is going to do it completely dressed, with even her backpack on,&#039; and then I relaxed. I felt it coming soon enough. It erupted against my panties, making it jet back at…</p>

        <p class="card-text">I have been interested in wetting for quite some time, been watching all kinds of sites on the Internet where girls wet themselves, and really enjoyed it a lot. I don&#039;t know how or when it started, I&#039;ve seen some girls showing signs of desperation every now and then when I&#039;m out, so I guess that&#039;s what triggered it for me. But I had never even considered doing it myself, until one lucky day when it just happened. (English is not my first language, I&#039;m sorry for any spelling mistakes or incorrect words that might appear in the text, but I hope you will get what I mean anyway.)
Since this is my first story I&#039;m posting, I thought that I&#039;d start with trying to describe how I look– from my experience most people…</p>

Maria Zellar is a thin girl, very geeky, but also quite attractive at the age of eighteen. Her dark, brown hair contrasts her pale skin very nicely, and her glasses compliment her face. She also has very large breasts for someone so thin.
Today Maria&#039;s senior class was on a field trip to the Natural History Museum. Her class had arrived in town at around 11:00am, and it was now 3:50. It was nearing time to leave, but Maria didn&#039;t even notice because she was so enthralled by the exhibits. She had been walking around a lot today, visiting all the shops in town and touring the museum, and so she had been drinking lots of water to…</p>

At work we have a strict policy. You can surf and mail work related and mail privately as well if it doesn&#039;t take up to much work time. Porn is strictly forbidden. As head of the IT department I had to check this from time to time. All Internet pages visited were logged on both who visited and how long they stayed if they were not in the approved list. I checked the log twice a week and if a site was clearly work related I added it to the list immediately. If it was on the edge of work related but not in violation of work codes (porn) I added it to a second list where the maximum visit…</p>
