        <p class="card-text">Samantha stood at the supermarket checkout regretting her decision to do her shopping before going to the toilet. She found herself hopping uncomfortably from foot to foot as her goods were scanned and she packed the shopping into bags. And it didn&#039;t help that the scanner wouldn&#039;t read one of the items, and so the checkout girl had to call the supervisor to sort it out. It was all adding to the time spent waiting, time Samantha was rapidly realising she didn&#039;t have. As she paid and loaded the last of the bags into her trolley she felt a small dribble of pee escape into her knickers. She thought to herself how lucky it was she was wearing a skirt and not jeans. She rushed to her car trying desperately to hold…</p>

        <p class="card-text">My name is Patience and my twin sister is called Prudence. They&#039;re rather old–fashioned names; they came from a 1950s singing duo that my grandmother was very fond of. Usually we abbreviate them to &quot;Prue&quot; and &quot;Paish&quot;. But in one very important aspect of our lives – our toilet habits – they turned out to be prophetic.
Prudence and I look very similar – tall, dark hair, nice figures and legs, and we tend to have similar attitudes and interests. We even go for the same type of boyfriends. But on the all–important question of emptying our bladders, we are very different.
We live with our Mum in North London. And since she gets a bit of criticism in this story, let me just say she has been a wonderful Mum. Dad…</p>

        <p class="card-text">The day after I&#039;d witnessed Katherine wet herself after waiting for hours to get to a loo, I wasn&#039;t at all sure how she would react. She had been humiliated by being forced to pee in her clothes in front of me, an accident I was responsible for, albeit indirectly. Now that she&#039;d had time to think things over, I felt sure she would decide to tender her resignation and move on, rather than having to face the awkwardness of working alongside me.
It had been good while it lasted, I told myself. She had asked for a shot at the job, despite the difficulties created by the lack of female facilities, but things had gone hopelessly wrong on her very first day. I didn&#039;t see how she could deal with the embarrassment.…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Just before I was served a nice southern breakfast in a southeast Virginia town I saw something of interest that captured my interest for the next several minutes. It was about an hour and a half after sunup and a bus from the nearest town had just dropped off a passenger that was one of the most beautiful African–American girls I had ever seen. She was standing in the large driveway that served the restaurant where I had the occasion to dine that morning so I got a close up view of her.
And, from her intense watching of the road that crossed the main thoroughfare I assumed that she was waiting for a ride, probably to her home. She had probably worked the midnight shift at one of the mills in town and had…</p>

        <p class="card-text">The following is a log I&#039;ve kept based on a close friend&#039;s detailed descriptions of her pants and pantie wetting incidents. We have a funny relationship. We flirt and tease, are very open, hug but that&#039;s all. I&#039;ve seen her dressing a few times down to her panties. I have pictures of her in her panties, topless, and getting dressed. I also have endless pictures of her...dressed, and a few upskirts, one with pee stained panties. Unfortunately, I can&#039;t share any of these. We share a love of lingerie, which we&#039;ll talk about, and sometimes she&#039;ll show me what she&#039;s wearing (pantie and bras), and other times describe them.

Martin tapped his foot impatiently. Three pints and no toilet break. His bladder was struggling to contain the liquid, but he took a gulp of his fourth pint regardless. He was seated in a booth at the back of the bar, away from the view of other punters. This he was thankful for. He couldn&#039;t refrain from fidgeting; scissoring his legs and clamping his thighs together, but acting in this manner would have been embarrassing in front of others.
As he reached again for his glass, a strong surge of desperation struck him. He gasped audibly, straightening his back to give his bladder more room to expand. With his hands planted firmly on his knees,…</p>

Since I was starting college in a few weeks, my stepmom agreed to come with me for some nice back to school clothes. Usually when I know I am going to try on lots of clothes, I wear things that are easy to get on and off repeatedly.

&quot;Yeah, honey?&quot;
&quot;I have to go.&quot;
Hitchhiking across the country had sounded like fun at the time. Darren had talked Kelly into it right away, and between the two of them they&#039;d managed to win Jill around as well. It would be good for her, they said. She needed to break out of her shell, and a big adventure could help. Darren had done it before, going the other way, and he hadn&#039;t had any trouble; the fact that he was a 6&#039;1&quot; kick boxer was a huge help, of course. So it was just daring and exciting enough to help Jill grow as a person, while not actually taking any risks.
Jill had enjoyed it too, especially when they were just out of Chicago, but every now and then she&#039;d gone quiet and appeared to be…</p>

        <p class="card-text">It was Saturday morning, and Sarah had slept late. She awoke with a fierce, burning need to pee. Simon was already up, and she glanced at the bedside clock. 10:00 a.m. Then she jumped out of bed and ran to the bathroom, where she immediately dropped her pyjamas around her feet and sat on the toilet. As a powerful, apparently never–ending torrent gushed out from between her legs; she began to do some mental arithmetic. Since she had been living with Simon, she had abandoned her habit of taking a leak before going to bed. She slept like a log, especially after good sex, and never awoke till she was absolutely bursting. On this occasion, she calculated, it was a good fourteen hours since her last visit to the…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Sarah sat on he tube train with her legs tightly crossed. In the long term, she reflected, things were going extremely well. In the weeks following her first frantic evening with Simon (see Sarah Stops Being Sensible – Part 1) they had had four more dates. On three of them (a girl can&#039;t be too predictable) she had got extremely desperate for the toilet and Simon had had to shepherd her to a ladies&#039; lavatory. The relationship had gone swimmingly (so to speak) and after a couple of months they had decided to move in together. They had found quite a nice little flat right on the outskirts of North London (housing in London was a real problem), of which the only disadvantage was a long journey home. She and Simon…</p>

Since her empathic abilities had developed she sensed she was destined to meet her soul mate, the women she would join with for life, but it never happened. Then she started working for the Paltathion Ministry of Education, only to be arrested for murder. And then she had believed she could postpone her execution indefinitely by giving herself to Cota, but now even that had failed.
Gabri–Ann sensed the jailers were coming with a new prisoner, and she combed her short blond hair and straightened her robe before they entered. The new prisoner was wearing an officer&#039;s uniform of the Imperial…</p>
