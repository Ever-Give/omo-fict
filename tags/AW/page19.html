        <p class="card-text">A Wet Sex fantasy based on a real experience
I was a desperately horny 18– year– old virgin guy, a Private in the Military, posted at an out of the way air base. The ratio of men to women on the base was about 15 to 1. There was a small town nearby, but to attract a girl there one had to surpass both competition from the military men and all the local competition. Us &#039;Pigeons&#039; as the local town boys called us– were highly resented for hitting on the local girls. I&#039;m not saying it was impossible to date a woman, but although I wasn&#039;t ugly, I did have an acne problem at that age. This certainly didn&#039;t help when the competition was so fierce, and I was also shy knowing that I wasn&#039;t as attractive as some of the…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Deirdre was late for work. She rushed out of bed at around 7:45am, got washed and changed into a navy blue business top and knee–length skirt with a white blouse and black shoes. She felt a slight twinge in her bladder, but ignored it because she felt she would use the toilet when she got to work.
However, when she got to her local station, she had to wait twenty minutes for the train. By this time, she felt the need to go even more and started slight fidgeting on the spot. She looked for a toilet at the station and found one, but when she walked to the toilet door, she couldn&#039;t open it– the sign on the front said &quot;Out of Order&quot;.
The train eventually came, but it was crowded with passengers. She was already…</p>

What a nightmare. Joan was sitting in her car and the traffic was backed up for miles; there seemed to be no way off the rural road she was stuck on, a combination of rain and sleet was pouring down, but worst off all... she had to go to the bathroom! Badly!!!
She had been to a dinner party with other people from her office where she had imbibed lots of wine and coffee. While she dutifully used the ladies&#039; room before she left, most of the liquid she had consumed hadn&#039;t reached her…</p>

Its 3 o&#039;clock in the morning and I&#039;ve just been for a wee. As I creep back into bed, May mumbles in her sleep rolling over to deny me even the three inches of mattress she usually allows me. Carefully I clamber over her to take her side of the bunk. The duvet doesn&#039;t stretch to my new side because May has it all. Is it like this for everyone who sleeps with someone else?
She looks so sweet curled up comfortably that I haven&#039;t the heart to yank the cover over to me. My ploy is to slide very close to her and put my arms around her. When she&#039;s asleep all her actions are reflex. She mumbles again and returns…</p>

Visitors from other regions are frequently overwhelmed by the explosive profusion of vines and flowers covering every tree, bush, and lawn, providing not only a dazzling kaleidoscope of color but also filling the air with intoxicating scents. At night, when the whippoorwills keen their haunting refrain and the warm breeze rustles the branches and Spanish moss in the high, twisted oaks, the South can seem like a universe apart from the dirt and bustle of modern America.
I had been hired as a networking consultant at one of the most lavish country club settings in the South, far removed in distance, culture, and setting…</p>

        <p class="card-text">October 8, 2002 was a bitter day for our little software company. We had begun the firm almost as kids and soared to the heights of the tech boom not as millionaires, but amazingly affluent for young adults in our late 20s. Fortunately, we were a solid company with a good product. We didn&#039;t tank when the bubble burst, but we definitely were no longer looking at retirement in our 30s as we all had imagined.
What really stung, though, was when it became apparent that takeover by one of the larger telecom concerns was inevitable. The offer was reasonable, we had incurred minor debt, and there was no question our financial security depended on selling out to a more secure operation. We were coming out alright,…</p>

It had been after a long night of incredible (and I mean *incredible*) sex with my fianc&#039;. I woke up before he did, sat up in bed, and just watched him sleep. God, he was so gorgeous. Then, I felt the urge to pee. It wasn&#039;t too bad, just one of those morning pees. I was about to get up, but he woke up. We smiled at each other and I cuddled up next to him. He playfully started kissing me, but I was distracted because my urge to pee was getting stronger –– a LOT stronger. As he started to gently kiss down my stomach, I knew I had to go relieve myself. I think he saw my discomfort and figured out that I had to pee.

        <p class="card-text">She stood stiffly with legs clenched tight and both hands pushed firmly against her groin. A gorgeous brunette, her exotic tanned features contorted by a longing desperation that served only to enhance her natural beauty. Robbo felt his penis harden inside his jeans. There was nothing she could do now. A slight sigh and a faint look of shocked realization started to form on her face. Then the first trickle as her long held urine started to seep down the inside of her stocking clad legs from under her pristine white dress. There was no avoiding it now. She was wetting herself!
Robbo was rudely startled out of his daydream by the shrill ring of the telephone. He turned and glared angrily at it, shifting…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Tina drifted slowly out of sleep. Her first thought was: Where am I? Her second: I have to go to the bathroom. Then she remembered. It was her first night in her aunt Jenny&#039;s incredibly big house, where she was going to spend the summer while working in the local bookshop before going back to school. She stared at the high ceiling, feeling the pressure in her bladder. Where was the bathroom, again? Tina decided to try to go back to sleep and wait until the morning.
When she awoke again she had dreamed of walking in the woods, finding a secluded place, lifting her skirt, and... She realized that she had nearly wet the bed. Clamping her hand to her crotch she tried to remember where to go to find a toilet. It…</p>

        <p class="card-text">This is a completely true story but the names have been changed.
Sarah, John, Suzy, and I went to the tube station where we intended on catching the Piccadilly line to Covent Garden. Delays were typical and it seemed that the next train was at least 15 minutes away. While the others moaned, I was secretly thrilled. Sarah&#039;s beers would be settling in her bladder and we were not going near toilets for some time. After twenty long minutes we were finally on the train when my hunch started to come true. Out of nowhere she shouted, &quot;God I have to pee&quot; and then crossed her legs and laughed nervously. Usually when trains stop dead in tunnels I feel uncomfortable but this time I was totally aroused. What followed…</p>

        <p class="card-text">The favorite teen hangout that summer (1957) was a 10–acre pond that had been enhanced with a sandy beach and a platform with an Olympic style diving board. There were rowboats for rent and there was a concession stand. Even though the lake was far away from her home Pat spent many of her spare hours there in the summer of her eighteenth year (1957).
Pat was by now an accomplished musician having mastered the guitar and she carried her guitar everywhere she went. She didn&#039;t swim that much so her main reason for visiting the lake was to be with her friends and entertain them with her guitar playing. She usually didn&#039;t wear a swimsuit to the lake, as she didn&#039;t plan to swim. Trips to the lake for Pat required…</p>
