        <p class="card-text">The quiet coolness, the occasional headlights cutting through the darkness, time alone with her thoughts, these were the reasons she loved driving late at night into the early morning hours. It was going to be a long drive but Monet was accustomed to late hours. Earlier that evening she dined at a favorite Chinese restaurant and though she knew she would be driving most of the night she drank tea, but the saltiness of the meal required several glasses of water as well, to quench her thirst. She paid the bill and walked past the restroom, deciding the need was not urgent and could wait until time to refuel. Wanting to get on the road was more pressing and there were always rest areas to stop at along the way.…</p>

        <p class="card-text">I have been dating Sara for more than 2 years; I&#039;m still very much in love with her and would do anything for her and she knows that.
Friday after work Sara and I had agreed to go drink some beers at our favorite bar. We found a distant table in the corner so that we could talk in privacy. After the third beer and a nice long conversation I had to excuse myself and go to the bathroom. Sara grabbed me by my arm and said, &quot;wait I have something I wanna ask you&quot; and I sat down again. &quot;Nick I know it&#039;s an unusual request, but you know that I have told you before that I get so turned on when you&#039;re desperate for a pee and I want you to hold it until we get home, will you do that for me?&quot; &quot;Sara honey, you know I…</p>

        <p class="card-text">The urge had come upon her quite suddenly. No gradual feeling of fullness in her bladder, she seemed to go from not wanting to pee to being bloody desperate in a matter of minutes.
This was not good. All she had on either side of her were tall hedges. Occasionally there was a gate that led to a field, but now that she wanted one there wasn&#039;t a gate to be seen. As she walked, so the feeling in her bladder became more acute. It was obvious to her that unless she could get into a field pretty soon she was going to have to empty her bladder on the path.
The trouble with that was that the lane was pretty twisty which meant that anyone could come around a corner at any moment. The thought that someone would…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Lucy and Jayne were walking home from work past the fountain in the town square when a teenage girl sat on the side of the fountain and overbalanced– to fall backwards into the water in front of several hundred people who were gathered around enjoying their lunch break or just relaxing.
When the girl emerged from her soaking she looked as embarrassed as hell, her face red and obviously quite close to tears. The two friends watched her step out of the water, her jeans and blue t–shirt clinging and shining on her body, water pouring off of them. Some well meaning people fussed around her, but it was obvious that all she wanted to do was get the hell away from the spotlight.
Lucy and Jayne walked on not wanting…</p>

The girl smiles and walks across to the car, and I&#039;m struck by this look she has– all bright and shiny, like the sunlight&#039;s just streaming straight through her. She&#039;s maybe twenty, twenty–one, not too tall, not too blonde, and with enough showing below the line of her little yellow top to tell me she must exercise her belly every day to keep it that shape. &#039;Are you going anywhere near Brinwell?&#039; she asks, and I give Howie a look that tells him we are…</p>

There was a tube strike in London today and for the thousands of people who normally use the tube to get to work every day, it made things very difficult. I live a bit out of London and have to get a train in, and then normally get the tube to the office. With out the tube it&#039;s about an hour&#039;s walk from Waterloo station. I don&#039;t bother with buses, as they are too full and stop at every street, so they would take ages to get me where I want to go. Anyway, I got to work in the morning OK.

        <p class="card-text">Mia Stevens got out of her white Kia Reo, the only car she could afford when her college costs were considered, and knew that she was more than a little nervous. It was late evening on a cool September night; the sun&#039;s final blood red rays were streaming through the leaves of a nearby tree. She pulled her blue jean jacket closer around her body to fend off the wind and started up the sidewalk towards the pale green house. At the age of nineteen, Mia was a beautiful girl. She had very long, curly black hair that was pulled back into a ponytail. Her curves were perfect and well defined and her face held the very essence of beauty. She was wearing a white sweater and light, faded blue jeans, just as she had been…</p>

When Carol got on the train she had a slight fullness in her bladder, but nothing serious.

        <p class="card-text">Sighting? Well no, but sort of a story. Back in the late fifties and early sixties I was an enlisted member of the United States Air Force. In 1962 I was in a position as a peon who manned the coffee bar at my squadron operations facility. In this role I was privy to many pilots&#039; conversations.
There was one conversation that was particularly interesting, as you will see. My squadron was one of fighter interceptor aircraft in the New York/Washington D. C. air defense sectors. These fighter interceptors were two–seater, two engine aircraft capable of mach one speeds with a cruising range of 1500 miles. However, for the purposes of this story they normally cruised at less than mach one for less than 1500 miles.…</p>

        <p class="card-text">In the last episode of Nancy&#039;s experiences we saw her in a very embarrassing situation on a city bus where her bladder released accidentally flooding her clothes. She was experiencing a public wetting humiliation to the nth degree only to awaken to a wet bed. Nancy&#039;s wetting accident on the city bus was merely a dream, a dream that coincided with her wetting her bed after a night of beer drinking. But, the dream that seemed so real was not too far removed from some of Nancy&#039;s real experiences. You see, Nancy had more than a few public–wetting accidents in her twenty–two years. Her dream, referred to above, was indeed based upon similar incidents although it wasn&#039;t real itself. As a youngster when playing with…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Laura Diaz rocked nervously watching Annika Sorenstam line up her putt. Diaz&#039;s bladder kept sending urgent relief signals, forcing the LPGA professional to squeeze her thighs together as best she could to hold her bladder in place. Unable to figure out why she needed to go so badly, Laura refocused on her game as Annika sunk her putt and moved away. Meanwhile, the foursome of Kelli Kuehne, Carin Koch, Beth Bauer and Natalie Gulbis paced the fourteenth green, each in their own gut wrenching battle with their bladders. Each used their caddies as cover to make a quick grab of relief in their crotch while no one looked. Kelli, glancing at the crowd, noticed several spectators bobbing up and down nervously, as they…</p>

        <p class="card-text">My First Wetting (Part 1)
This is the true story of my first sexual encounter with piss. It was when I was 18 during the summer break.I spent my morning reading a book and drinking as it was a fairly hot day and only went to the toilet once after I woke up. After I finished the book, I went to the mall as I was planning to see a movie with my friend Jade. I met her at the box office and we bought our tickets and cokes. It was one of those really long movies and we both wanted to watch it for some time but we hadn&#039;t come round to it so this was one of the last screenings of the movie. We entered the cinema and it was fairly empty, there were only 2 other people in there. We picked some seats at the back away…</p>

        <p class="card-text">The ride had been long, hot and dusty across the Painted Desert of the American southwest in my 60 Chevy Impala convertible. Jackie and I had left for home after an early morning breakfast that included a lot of coffee and juice. We choose to go west for spring break instead of the typical Florida or Padre Island thing that most college kids choose, as we both loved the desert and had friends in Palm Springs. As we drove along that stretch of deserted blacktop, listening to music on the radio, we talked and kept drinking away at a cooler of cokes that we had purchased. A couple of hours into the desert, having long passed the last remnants of civilization, or at least a gas station with a bathroom, I noticed…</p>
