        <p class="card-text">A Chinese shop assistant provided me with one of the most interesting lunch hours of my life. I made a visit to Wendovers, a new clothing shop in the High Street to buy some new shirts. While I searched the racks for shirts in my size, and in my style, I overheard a conversation going on between two of the shop assistants. As I began to listen, my ears literally pricked up.
I had already noticed the Chinese girl when I came in. She was slim with long black hair, and dressed in typical working attire –– black heels, black pencil skirt and a white short–sleeved blouse. She was standing in an enclosed area where the tills were located, along with an older woman with a repellent perm and frumpy clothes.

        <p class="card-text">This is a true story; it happened last May. To give you an idea of my appearance I am 5 foot 2 inches, short brown hair, wide hips and small waist, B cup breasts, had just turned 18 then, and my name is Natalie.
On May 3 I had been up most of the night studying for my three–hour advanced placement Calculus exam, drinking some coffee to stay awake while cramming. In the morning I took a shower and put on a short grey cotton skirt and red button up t–shirt with snowmobile boots, and made a last cup of tea to keep me awake. I have major problems with time management so all–nighters are pretty regular, and I always forget to drink water when I&#039;m on them, so I&#039;ve ended up dehydrated before, it&#039;s not fun.…</p>

        <p class="card-text">During the vacation after my second year at university I got a phone call from Jill, a fellow student on my course who I knew casually. We were due to attend a seminar in the city that week and Jill was going to borrow her mother&#039;s car and drive to town. She wanted to park at my house and then we could go into the city by train. She was not a particularly attractive girl, but I had nothing much going on at the time, so I told her to be here at 8.30 so we would have plenty of time to get into town.
Jill duly arrived about 10 minutes late. She was a tall thin girl, with long light brown hair but with very plain, or even unattractive, looks. However she was wearing skin–tight jeans that were stretched over her…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Juliana crossed her legs again and ordered another caffe latte. She was frankly, ready to burst, but wanted to stretch the moment for as long as she could. The thrill of being in a strange town, where she could do whatever she wanted. She was dressed in a blue cotton skirt and a red t–shirt. There were other garments in her large handbag. She drank her coffee and paid her bill, then walked in the direction of the square. Her long black hair reached almost to her waist; and below her waistline the contour of her panties was visible. She preferred full–size, as everything went straight through thongs, leaving no more than a sneeze–stain. She had lived in this country for fifteen of her twenty–three years, but…</p>

Nicole was a dream girl...shoulder length brunette hair that she always had in some sexy position and never wore the wrong way. Always wearing her short skirts with her stockings and high heels...and of course, today, she was wearing one as well. A short pink skirt that definitely wasn&#039;t school dress code length, but she managed to keep her fingertips above it and black stockings that ran right up to under the end of her skirt with her black high heels that just went past her ankle. And her cute little top that was way too tight and showed off her 32 C breasts nicely. All the guys…</p>

        <p class="card-text">I first saw her as I was walking along the main concourse at Kennedy Airport, looking for the departure gate for the American Airlines flight to San Francisco. She was perched up on one of the metal railings, shoes off and peering down at her feet. A slim blonde, probably in her mid–twenties, I could not help but admire how apt was her appearance– I&#039;d already recognized her flight attendant uniform as belonging to the Scandinavian Airlines (or SAS) stable. She was simply very cute, and as hard as I tried not to stare at her as passed, I just couldn&#039;t help myself.
She glanced up and caught me looking, but instead of quickly avoiding my gaze the way most western women would do, she smiled. It was an electric…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Sam took Jenny by the hand, and led her into the house. &quot;Would you like to take a bath while I run your wet things though the washing machine?&quot;
Jenny sniffed, wiped a tear from her eye with the back of her hand, and nodded meekly. So Sam led her upstairs and into the bathroom and began to run a bath, adding copious amounts of bubble bath. The sound of the water gushing into the tub was almost enough to make Jenny lose control and completely wet her knickers a second time, but she fought hard against the urge and just about managed to hold on. A couple of short leaks escaped, and she felt the pee gently dribbling down the inside of her thigh, but it was such a minor accident that Sam didn&#039;t even notice it.…</p>

The sun beat down on her, and a heat haze rose from the pavement. A gentle breeze took the edge off the heat, but it was still easily the hottest day of the year so far. She felt thirsty, and wished she could take a long, refreshing swig from the bottle of water at the bottom of her bag; but she dared not. She was already feeling the first faint urges of the need for a pee, and there was nowhere that she could stop to use the toilet on the long walk across town to her old friend Samantha&#039;s house.

We would look the garage sales up in the paper, consult the street directory, and work out the most direct route to follow to get around them all.
One Saturday one of the two girls couldn&#039;t come, leaving only four of us. I was already aware that Sally, the girl who did come, tended to have a smallish bladder, so I was interested to see that she brought a can of soft drink with her, which she drank on our way to the first house.

        <p class="card-text">We woke late, not surprisingly. When I opened my eyes, I found Julia&#039;s face before me, her head propped up on her hand. She smiled and rubbed her left leg against my thigh –– such a wonderful way to start the day and I did not suppress the groan at the pleasure it brought me. I reached down and stroked her thigh as it came within reach, relishing the softness of her skin.
&quot;That was quite a revelation last night,&quot; she said, smirking, her blue eyes peeping through the strands of her fringe. &quot;Why didn&#039;t you tell me about your.... interest before?&quot;
&quot;Why do you think?&quot; I said, shrugging slightly. &quot;I didn&#039;t think you&#039;d be interested. More likely, I thought it would scare you off.&quot;
She considered this for a moment…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Sue James badly needed to pee. In fact, she was absolutely bursting.
Waiting impatiently at yet another red light, she snatched the opportunity to tightly clench her thighs, something she found very difficult to do when actually driving. She closed her eyes, slapping the palm of her left hand repeatedly against the edge of the steering wheel. She had no idea why this should help her fight off the nearly–overwhelming urge to release the contents of her swollen bladder, but it did.
&quot;Oh, come on!&quot; she complained to the traffic light whose baleful red stare had halted her progress. The pain was growing intolerable.
Of course, she&#039;d been forced to hold on to a full bladder often enough in her career, especially…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Belle couldn&#039;t believe Michael had just left her here, tied up all evening with this damned ball in her mouth and her bladder really aching from being full for so long.
When he&#039;d suggested tying her up for the evening, she had been excited. This kind of foreplay had such a profound effect on Michael and invariably led to the most amazing sex. She had agreed readily, and without giving her time to reconsider, Michael had promptly dragged into the bedroom and started tying her up.
&quot;You&#039;re keen,&quot; she had remarked as he bound her wrists and pulled up a chair to secure one end of the rope to the overhead beam, preventing her from sitting down. He had looked down at her from his precarious perch and waggled his…</p>

&quot;Yes,&quot; Andy nodded. &quot;This is Byron&#039;s Pool. You seem disappointed.&quot;
&quot;I am a little,&quot; said Helen. &quot;I&#039;d been expecting something a bit more ... well ... spectacular.&quot;
She looked around once again while Andy drove the punt pole deep into the riverbed and looped the mooring chain around it. They were hove–to in the middle of a clear, shallow pool with a sand and gravel bottom. It was no more than fifty metres long, and perhaps thirty metres across at its widest point. Long strands of green weed streamed out in the current, and the occasional stickleback darted in and out between them. At the upstream end of the pool was an ugly concrete weir over which the river rushed headlong in an angry,…</p>
