Ann and Linda sat in Linda&#039;s room. They were talking about the week before when they had helped a girl overcome the taboo of peeing herself when she had to go so bad she was in extreme agony. They were also talking about the mother peeing herself to show the girl it was all right to pee herself. When they were all pissed the mother allowed the girl to pee herself when she wanted if it was possible to do it undetected and said she would be doing it as well. &quot;We need to find a way to make our mothers pee themselves with us. Perhaps they will like it too and allow us to do it when we want to so we don&#039;t have to hide our wet…</p>

Julia and Jessica had been friends since childhood. They had grown up together and were now 20 years old. They had always talked openly together about almost everything, including sexual urges and behaviour. Occasionally they indulged in wetting themselves together, for they both enjoyed feeling their bladders filling up to their capacity and sometimes they went that one bit too far. One Saturday the two were shopping in town. They had drunk several large cokes during the morning and were seated in the…</p>

        <p class="card-text">It had started out as a sort of confession. I didn&#039;t know how Sarah would react, but I had really wanted to talk to Sarah about it, mainly because we always told each other our secrets. We had confided in each other since we first became friends over ten years ago. We knew most things if not everything about each other. So I didn&#039;t have too much of a problem telling her. I&#039;d had a little accident in my jeans on the way home from the station a few weeks earlier, and I had realised that wetting my knickers had really turned me on. My mum had been very understanding when I got home, and had confessed that she had wet her pants several times too over the years. I just hadn&#039;t quite expected this reaction from Sarah…</p>

        <p class="card-text">It was a very hot day when Sally went back from her basketball game. The temperature was way above 30 degrees Celsius and she was wearing a tank top and light blue jeans. She was regretting now, that she hadn&#039;t put on a skirt instead of the jeans, but the morning had been a lot cooler.
The game had gone well – her team won by ten points. But it was very exhausting, too, in this weather. She drank at least two big bottles of water during the game and still felt thirsty after it – so she went for a beer to the restaurant nearby to celebrate their victory with her teammates. 
They had a great time! They kept buying rounds, and by the end of their stay, Sally had gulped down two beers, a soda and a coffee – so…</p>

Our day in the park ended up as a wet one not only for Jenny, but also for her new friend Allison, as well for me. I certainly didn&#039;t plan it that way, although I enjoyed the results. And no, we&#039;re not talking about rain here. Actually, Jenny had a bladder control problem that, while sometimes embarrassing for her, brought much delight to me. To be fair, I must note that some of her problem, maybe most of it, was of her own making. She consumed what I considered excessive amounts of bottled water and, when tired and needing energy, far too much cola. I had discovered this more than a year earlier, on our second date. We had…</p>

Rebecca grinned to herself as her daughter crashed down the stairs. Although in age technically and legally an adult she may be, but Lucy could still be a noisy adolescent when she wanted to. 
&#039;Okay, then. I&#039;m ready.&#039; Lucy put her arms round her mother&#039;s neck and gave her a hug. &#039;Thanks, Mum– I&#039;ve been looking forward to today for ages and ages.&#039;

The bus arrived and Ann and Linda got on. When they were sitting Ann looked around. They were sitting at the back of the bus and no one was near them. Ann leaned over to Linda. &quot;I do it here IF you promise to pee through your panties on the toilet in the mall.&quot; Linda thought about it for a few seconds. She was wearing black jeans so it wouldn&#039;t show a wet spot if she pulled her pants up to her wet panties. &quot;Deal, but I only promise to try, I don&#039;t know if I can do it!&quot;
Ann just got up a little bit and pulled her skirt out from her bottom. She sat back down, folded her skirt up so it wasn&#039;t conspicuous but clearly…</p>

First thing was an accident that happened to my girlfriend few years ago. I saw it and after that occasion I have been interested and also little excited about this subject. I really enjoy if that happens to other young women, but after that one accident I have not seen that kind of wetting event. Close situations many times (club lines and taxi lines in the night for example), but not really wetting accidents. I never thought I could accidentally pee my pants myself.

Tonight was the night. All week I had carefully monitored my fluid intake preparing for this special night. My girlfriend and I were going out to a party with some close friends and I was driving. Normally this would have been the short straw, but, my mock annoyance covered my anticipation and delight well. In the four hours we were there, I helped her drink down at least three pints of various liquids while sipping slowly at a simple glass of water. I couldn&#039;t believe my luck as we walked back to our car, as she still hadn&#039;t gone to pee and by now must have a bladder that bulged more than my erect cock. Luckily Jess did…</p>

What caught me about her was for someone who tried too hard to act too good for me, she really made a lot of bad choices in men back then. 
It was a little into February when she told the class a story about how when she was younger she would hold it as long as she could, run up to the top stair of her apartment building, then cross her legs and pee her pants.

Margaret, Maisie and Mandy were sisters. Margaret was the oldest aged 22, Maisie was 20, and Mandy was 19.
About 5 years ago, while she was in school, Maisie had taken part in a French Exchange visit, where she went to stay with a family near Lyons for two weeks, and then the daughter of the French family, Juliette, came to stay with them for two weeks. They had kept in touch, and Juliette, who was the same age as Maisie, was spending a fortnight&#039;s break with Maisie and her sisters. Of course, there…</p>

        <p class="card-text">I&#039;ve had quite a few boyfriends, but nothing very serious. With Paul I knew from the beginning it would be different. He was good–looking, intelligent, had similar interests to mine, but above all he was kind, thoughtful, considerate. I really felt this as going to be something special.
I like to take things slowly, and our first two dates ended with no more than a chaste kiss. On the third date we went to a movie, and then to the pub. Half way through our second pints he suggested, rather shyly, that I might like to come home with him. Although I tried not to show too much enthusiasm, I accepted straightaway – indeed, I should have been very disappointed if he hadn&#039;t asked. We finished our drinks, and Paul…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Ann was walking home from a night out with her best friend Linda. Both of them had gone to dinner, then the movies and some drinks afterwards. She was 18 years old so she only had diet coke the whole evening and she had to piss, piss badly!
When she wanted to go to the toilet in the bar Linda realised they were going to miss the last bus home if they didn&#039;t leave now. So they ran to the bus stop, jumped in and drove of. It was a 25–minute drive and she was getting more desperate each second. Though it felt she was going to have the urine pour out of her mouth soon she held on until the bus came to their stop. Linda also mentioned she had to pee badly but Ann knew she was worse. Linda had gone to the toilet…</p>

        <p class="card-text">I should have gone at the cafe! Dammit! Someone had vandalised the loos at this– my home station! I had only just managed to jump on the tube before the doors shut, and I didn&#039;t need to go too badly then. Besides I thought I could use the loo here. The sign said the nearest public toilet was at Nightingale Road. I knew where that was, but, it was half a mile in the opposite direction from home. It was just getting dark and I should have been home at 5 o&#039;clock, it was now 5:15. Dammit! I would just have to hold it and walk the two miles home.
At 19 years old it seemed a bit much having to tell mum what time I would be home. But she worries, and it was only polite to tell her a time, I suppose. I had been sure…</p>

This is another real life experience from me :)
When I had finished cleaning up after my first accident, I was still pretty confused... I mean, I&#039;m not supposed to wet my pants when I&#039;m almost 20 years, how could such an odd thing be the best turn–on ever? I still haven&#039;t figured that one out, but I stopped bothering. It&#039;s the best feeling ever, I don&#039;t care if I can&#039;t explain it as long as I love it!
Anyway, I had two full days alone still, and it&#039;s not often I get the opportunity to be alone like this. Also, with school over for the week and no particular homework I needed to care about, I had nothing to do…</p>
