        <p class="card-text">Turtle Island, October 1644
With only the feeble starlight, walking on the docks through the mist made Temperance nervous. Her pace kept accelerating, and soon it became even brisker than she thought possible. Cold was sending shivers down her spine but she knew she could not go faster without jeopardizing the poor balance alcohol induced. She passed by a man throwing up every ounce of liquid he had had in the night and her heart missed a beat when she twisted her ankle because of a slippery paving stone. Her squeaking out of surprise and pain was muffled by the mist but not enough. Four blokes she had not spotted at first were coming towards her with small shining blades in their hands, and dark brown rum in…</p>

        <p class="card-text">I am Kazziebabe, and these are a true stories about me wetting my knickers.
When I was 32, a good few years ago now, I was working evenings in a pub, part–time. I was separated and in the process of getting divorced when I met a really nice man. We started seeing each other and after a couple of tease–filled months we had progressed to heavy petting and sex.
On the nights I worked in the pub, I would go round to his bedsit to see him, just for half an hour or so, as we both had day jobs with early starts. We used to mostly just play manually on these occasions, saving the sex for when we had more time together.
Oooh, he was soooo good with his hands, and was very naughty, teasing me in lovely ways until I…</p>

        <p class="card-text">A few months after our soccer state championship, I was heading off to college. Though nervous, I was extremely excited to begin the next part of my life.
My parents helped me move in– I beat my roommate there, and was nearly finished when she came in with her parents. Her name was Sarah–she was a very pretty redhead. Our parents left and we got to talking– it turned out that she had played volleyball in high school, so we had a strong interest in sports in common. The girls next door stopped by around nine and asked if we were interested in going out that night. One of them, whose name was Ashley, had a sister who was in her senior year and said we could all go to a party at her boyfriend&#039;s house. We both…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Sharon had enjoyed her time at North Hill Military Academy, but she was quite glad to return home after six weeks of physically and mentally demanding training. Not only had she learned some valuable life skills, she had also discovered some activities she really enjoyed– rock climbing, paintballing, target shooting, even wetting her pants. The trainers had stressed that the girls were contractually obliged to keep silent about what had taken place over the past six weeks and were not even permitted to talk to each other about the camp once they had left the premises. The organizers of the training had even gone so far to mail the girls&#039; houses, specifically asking their families to refrain from asking…</p>

She was doing well in all her second year classes and had good grades going into her final exams. Her Psychology 241 class was by far the most interesting course she had ever taken. She had her first ever sexual experience with Kathy, her professor, but it seemed like a one–time deal. Sharon had stayed behind after class a number of times; approaching her professor after all the other students had left. Last week, she had even gone to her during office hours with several questions, seductively dressed in a skimpy workout shirt and tight shorts in obvious desperation after a bottle of water and two beers, but hadn&#039;t gotten any response from…</p>

I&#039;ve been having these sorts of problems (and accidents) for as long as I can remember, and my friends and family just don&#039;t seem to get it. I guess I have a small bladder (much smaller than anyone else), and so need to pee a lot.

&quot;Waiting, but for how long?&quot;
At last the coach was stopping– pulling up at the side of the road, not a proper coach stop, but just a bit of pavement near Oxford Street. Frantic, not able to think of anything except finding a loo, Joan looked desperately around for the sign she so wanted to see: &quot;Ladies,&quot; or &quot;Public Lavatories.&quot;
Nothing! Nowhere was there the slightest sign of a public loo, the loos she had been praying to get to for the last hour and which had become the centre of her existence for the last fifteen minutes.
The awful reality of the situation suddenly struck Joan; she was going to have to stand up and walk off the coach, then walk along…</p>

        <p class="card-text">&quot;Are you ready for the exam?&quot; I asked my best friend Lacey as we trudged down the dim hallway to Math class. She and I studied all week, but neither of us was good with numbers unless we were shopping at the mall. &quot;I don&#039;t know, Kristie. I guess.&quot; She replied half–heartedly as she held the door to our room for me. We took our usual seats in the very back of the classroom and settled in. Lacey set a large bottle of water on her desk, a remedy I recommended to her for the nail biting she always did during a big test. We said little to each other, and when class began our collective focus was set solely on passing this exam. It was the last class in our last year of college, and the only thing keeping us from our…</p>

        <p class="card-text">When I was 18 and a senior in high school, our soccer team went to the state finals. We were playing in the semi–final game Saturday, and if we won, were playing in the state finals on Sunday. We headed up to Denver after school on Friday, because our coach didn&#039;t want us to play after a 2–hour bus ride. Unfortunately, the school was only planning to pay for Saturday night and all the girls had to share beds because we could only get half the rooms. I was rooming with three other senior girls. Kelly was a starter, like me, while Alyssa and Kira were backups. Though this was not a big deal, Alyssa played the same position as me and made it clear she thought she should be the starter.
Anyways, we got up to the…</p>

Mandy had an unusual relationship with her boss and lover, Doug. Outside of work, he was everything she could ask for in a man; he was kind, passionate, and extremely fun to be with. However, the situation was a little different at work. He had requested that their relationship should be kept a secret for now, because it looked unprofessional and he was fearful of getting of being perceived as someone who took advantage of women who worked for him. He asked her to continue to address him as Mr. Welsh at work and not to show any public displays of affection at the office. He promised her that he would tell…</p>

        <p class="card-text">One morning I had tons of laundry to do, having put it off for a week or more. My roommate Jess and I are in college, and we live on the second floor of our apartment complex. The laundry room is in the basement, shared by all the tenants in that section of the complex. The laundry room is also the storage room, with each apartment&#039;s storage cubbies around the edge of the basement.
I made sure to get up early so I could be the first one to get my laundry in. Usually Saturdays were the busiest time for laundry so I avoided that day. This was a Friday morning and hopefully there would be no one getting their laundry in before me since I had so much to do.
I had about three baskets worth to carry down with…</p>
