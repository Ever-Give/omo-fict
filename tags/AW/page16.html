        <p class="card-text">This story is fiction, although it is based on a real event that was mentioned to me a few years ago by a friend of the main character– whose name has been changed. The final outcome actually happened, but the rest of the story I have made up to fit credibly around it, based on what seems likely from what details I was told, and from various experiences of my own.
&quot;Okay, well I&#039;ll see you on Friday night,&quot; Kylie said to Dale, her new boyfriend. They gave each other a quick kiss then left the small inner–city park where they&#039;d met for lunch. Dale had to go back to work, but the rest of the afternoon was Kylie&#039;s to spend as she wished, as she had only casual work, and there would be no more for her for the rest…</p>

        <p class="card-text">I have a friend, Jessica, who has quite a weak bladder and often cannot even wait 5 or 6 hours without a pee. My super pee marathon encouraged her to try a normal pee marathon and go 26.2 hours without a pee. I was out of town at the time, but Jessica recounted the entire experience for me:
Well I knew I usually had to pee worst in the morning, so I decided on a three–day weekend I would get up at 7:55 AM on Sunday and go for my morning pee. Using the assumption that I&#039;d be done by 8, (with getting out of bed taking two or three minutes) I figured I&#039;d go the day and be able to have my next morning pee at 10:12 AM the next day, exactly 26.2 hours later. I told my neighbor that I needed to wash some clothes and…</p>

        <p class="card-text">VFA–251, the &quot;Annie Oakleys,&quot; was the first all–female attack squadron in the U.S. Navy. Flying the versatile F/A–18D Hornet, they could strike any target from tanks to ships to aircraft. The Squadron Leader was Andrea, a Navy Commander. Newly formed, they got their first assignment at sea, to a Nimitz–class carrier.
All but one of the ten squadron members flew out to the carrier on schedule. One of the aircraft had serious mechanical problems, and the pilot, Denise, had to stay behind while it was repaired, since there were no spare aircraft available. By the time it was finally fixed the carrier was halfway to its patrol station. Denise had to fly out to meet it, traveling several hours over the ocean. The…</p>

The classrooms in the concrete building lined the outer walls while the center core was offices and other rooms. A large twenty foot wide corkboard with notices and advertisements lay on the inside wall, across from room 304, where economics 102 was starting in ten minutes. Windows into the classrooms had curtains on them so the class had the option of closing them for privacy. 304 had the curtains open, the room was still mostly empty, only a few students had gathered to sit down.

Nicki, just turning 19, blonde, slim body, had never been in a desperate situation in her life. She woke up in the morning, just like any other morning, and she was going off campus to visit one of her friends. Her car was in the repair shop, so she had to take the bus for an hour trip, plus a long walk from there to reach her friends.
She got up in the morning, took a shower, and did all the other things a normal person would do. She got dressed in a light blue top with a black mini skirt. She used the restroom, and then consumed some coffee before leaving. It was a 10–minute walk to the nearest…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Any of you who work in construction will know that, occasionally, a zip–tight bladder is pretty much essential. Whilst I was at university (on my year placement) I really learned the hard way! It wasn&#039;t the first time I&#039;d wet my knickers – either in public or privately ;–) – but doing it at work was never top of my list!
I was working with a firm of architects and was asked to go and do some survey drawings at an English cathedral. This involved going up into the roof space and then climbing down onto scaffolding about 25 meters above–ground on the outside of the building. I love this kind of stuff about my job and was really chuffed when the practice manager said I could handle the work myself.

        <p class="card-text">*** Why Is The Bed Wet?
I met this girl named Kate about a year ago. We were both 25 at the time and we have been dating since. Things were going well for us. But recently Kate began having this problem...
&quot;Kate, Why is the bed wet?&quot; I asked as I woke her up from a sleep.
&quot;WHAT?&quot; Kate yelled as she sat right up in bed. &quot;Oh my god! I ... I wet the bed!&quot; Kate was sitting in a large puddle in the bed. The sheets were wet enough that you could see liquid being squeezed out of the fabric as she moved. I woke because I felt the wetness seep over to my side of the bed and found my pajamas wet as well. Kate had a sheer panic look on her face and tears were forming in her eyes.
&quot;Shhh ... Kate it&#039;s ok, accidents…</p>

After more than two years of trying to get tickets, design a costume and the ordeal of auditions, the cute young housewife in the pigtails and the schoolgirl plaid skirt had often thought this moment would never come. Her white blouse and short, very short, skirt really accented her youthful figure. Hanna leapt to her feet and made her way to the stage, her plaid skirt flying, revealing glimpses of white cotton panty as she took steps two at a time. The camera operator, used to all manner of spectacle at the show, was distracted in spite of his experience and drew in close as Hanna&#039;s panties again made an appearance. &quot;Sweet, sweet, sweet!&quot; he spoke…</p>

Ms. C_ always wore nice flowing knee high hemmed skirts and when we were all sitting on the classroom mat she would squat down in front of us to talk.
This would always get the attention of all the boys, myself included, because Ms. C_ would sometimes forget to tuck her skirt behind her knees and we would get a free peepshow of her underwear. After that we were left talking about what…</p>

        <p class="card-text">You know how there are people out to get you, even when you haven&#039;t done anything to them? That was what it was like for Clara Birks. It was her first year in the sorority, and she wanted to make a good impression on the girls. Clara was about 5&#039;5, 105 lbs, with brown hair and brown eyes. She was merely average. So why did Amanda Poole hate her so much? Some think it was because when attending the initiation, Amanda wet herself in fear, and mistook Clara&#039;s laughter at her friends for laughter at Amanda&#039;s embarrassing accident. Who knows, but after that night, Amanda had regained her dignity by cliquing up in her rich circle of friends. Amanda soon became the ringleader of the popular crowd of 5. There was Kali…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Amoeba
21–year–old woke up one morning and tossed off her sheets, which were slightly damp. She reached down and felt the bottom of her light blue cotton thong, which was fairly dry, but still a little damp. She cursed her small bladder and got out of bed, her long blonde hair flowing down to just above her tight little ass. She shook out of her panties, letting them drop the floor, and ripped the sheets off the bed, moving to the kitchen and putting them in the washer. She noticed the time was 8:50 and wanted to leave at 9 for her shopping, so she ran back into her room and threw open her drawer, grabbing a pair of pink cotton bikini panties, pulling them over her long legs and covering her delicate bush.…</p>

        <p class="card-text">My girlfriend, Michelle, and I went on a trip out of town a few weeks ago. We drove to a town that about 8 hours away to see a really big concert– the biggest event of the year. We had been looking forward to it for a long time (all weekend alone together... away from home). So we packed up our bags, loaded into my SUV, and headed off. We made it there in good time. Checked into a hotel. All that. So for two days we strolled around the concert grounds enjoying all the live performances by all the bands. And each night, we&#039;d wind up having even more fun in our hotel room– and in the hotel hot tubs (but that&#039;s another story).
Anyway... The bathrooms at the concert weren&#039;t wonderful, but they weren&#039;t the…</p>

        <p class="card-text">As promised, here&#039;s my next posting in the &quot;Sarah&quot; series. I&#039;ve researched this carefully this evening and the timings seem about right. I was loading the washing machine after 90 minutes this evening, but I already had a cup of tea and a beer inside me when I started. Read on – you&#039;ll see what I&#039;m going on about!
Once again, this is pure fantasy, sadly there is no Sarah, and all events are fictitious.
After our experiences on the beach, I couldn&#039;t wait to find out what Sarah had in mind for a holding on contest. I had to wait until we got home, because she said what she had planned would be far too messy to contemplate in the B&amp;B we had been staying at in Cornwall.
The following weekend she outlined the …</p>

        <p class="card-text">I eventually got into the habit of mostly holding on all day at school and not going to the toilet. I think this probably started from spending so much time with the boys. While girls often tend to go to the toilet together, boys are much more haphazard. For example, if we were in the middle of a game of cricket or something during lunch time we&#039;d keep playing as long as we possibly could after the bell rang, and only when it was too late to go would I realize I really could have done with a visit to the toilet. The only acceptable option then would be to just hold on for the rest of the afternoon, which I always managed to, refusing to ask to be excused during class. Having always been quite a tomboy I was…</p>
