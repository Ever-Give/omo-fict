Episode 4 – The Wet Zone
As Laurie&#039;s jeep was riding over campus grounds once more, she had some trouble keeping her mind on the road. Laurie sat fidgeting in her seat, trying to keep her feet on the pedals; she was wearing sandals, and she could see her toes curling in them. Her white cotton panties were already wet with sweat, partly from the heat, partly from the excitement but mostly because she was holding her sphincter muscle closed with all the strength in her body. Laurie was wearing a pink dress with a flower pattern, and both her thighs were pressing hard against each other through it; the soft fabric was the only thing that prevented her equally sweaty legs from…</p>

        <p class="card-text">MaryBeth Pickman did little to hide her annoyance when her mother told her that the family was going to the zoo for her little brother Joey&#039;s birthday. She was, after all, eighteen years old, an adult and far too old to be going to the zoo with a small child. But, her mother had used the famous &quot;as long as you&#039;re living under my roof, you&#039;re living under my rules, and I say you are coming,&quot; and MaryBeth was forced to go. She was more than a little upset, thinking it unfair for her mother to say that to her, but she had little choice and that Friday found herself riding next to an overly excited Joey who did little more than talk about how much he wanted to see a real live elephant.

        <p class="card-text">It was 11:45 and Nancy had just finished her filing. That was a normal duty and what came later was her notion of simply completing the job. She realized she had a full bladder and she was squirming somewhat in her tight gray gabardine skirt as she worked. Not to worry as she would be finished in a few minutes and would be free to go to the bathroom on the way home. 
It was a fine Saturday morning in 1957 that Nancy found herself working. The building was open and therefore the office was open. She wanted to impress her boss with her sense of duty. Most of what she was doing could have been put off until Monday but there were two reports her boss had asked her to do that were outside the domain of her job…</p>

        <p class="card-text">The night had been fun, for sure. Driving along the dark road back to their hometown, the two seniors were giddy with excitement. The Senior Night their high school had thrown for them was pretty cool, especially considering that it was the principal&#039;s idea. Surely his teenage son planned it, they had thought, laughing.
Of course, the principal didn&#039;t know that over half of the seniors had snuck in alcohol, sneaking drinks in the bathrooms or out by their cars when the chaperones weren&#039;t looking. There wasn&#039;t going to be any alcohol in this car though, Amber thought, as she drove home, still with a slight buzz on. She couldn&#039;t believer her Dad let her take HIS car, his prized Mercedes, out on the town for one…</p>

Episode 3 – &#039;Till Wet do us Part
Laurie&#039;s jeep stopped with screaming tires at her sorority dorm. The door on the passenger side swung open immediately, and Kitty jumped out; her jeans were thoroughly soaked, she had already peed in her pants on two separate occasions but her bladder still wasn&#039;t empty – and her need remained. She took a few steps towards the dorm, but then looked back to see what was keeping the others. Laurie was helping Cathy, who was still crying and sobbing –as she had been all through the drive over here–, out of the car. She was trembling, clothed in nothing but a soiled T–shirt and her soaking wet panties. &quot;Will you hurry up!&quot; Kitty screamed, &quot;I still…</p>

        <p class="card-text">I&#039;ve been into peeing since I was a teenager, and I did a lot of stuff in the privacy of my bedroom when I was in high school. I had a few close calls during junior high and high school, where I leaked a little into my panties, but nothing that anyone noticed. One of my most memorable experiences happened in college. I went to a small private school that was out in the middle of nowhere. During my junior year, I took summer classes so I could graduate one semester early. One Saturday in late July, one of the student groups organized a day trip to an amusement park that was about 150 miles away. They chartered a bus, and we left at 9:00 o&#039;clock in the morning. The bus was very comfortable, with air conditioning…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Nancy was well aware of the beer drinker&#039;s rule of thumb; during the first six beers you will most likely forgo taking a trip to the rest room. But, when you finally do succumb to an aching bladder after the first six you will find that you have to answer the call immediately and that the call will occur often. More accidents occur after the first six beers in a beer drinking session than at any other time. Nancy had numerous experiences with beer drinking sessions but she had never had an accident until... Nancy was in a neighborhood tavern drinking with her new boyfriend and she noticed that she had just finished her sixth beer.

In fact the whole family occasionally went along and they picnicked.

When she was thirteen she was an accomplished fly fisherman. By the time she reached fourteen, her parents had divorced. Nancy was sent to live with her mother. She was devastated; she loved being with her Dad. After that, she was only able to see him sporadically, due to school and his work schedule.

Laurie was a college student, a respectable girl with shoulder–length blonde hair and a perfect attendance record. Her friend Kitty was something else: she was a bit of a rebel who would rather be attending a party than a lecture. The girls were close friends since childhood, however, and were now roommates in their sorority. The night after the last of their final exams there was a big party at a friendly sorority house, and both girls were going. Under the light of a full moon Laurie drove her jeep through the fields on campus; the sorority houses were quite far from each other, so it was quite a drive. Kitty was fidgeting in the passenger&#039;s seat, and Laurie knew from experience…</p>

When Joni felt her bladder starting to fill as she sat at her desk working the report due to her boss before the end of the day, she considered taking a bathroom break, but was on a roll– and she wasn&#039;t really needing to go badly enough to warrant getting up and leaving her work.
Lunch had really dried out her mouth and made her rather thirsty so she downed the rest of her half full bottle of water and rolled a meter on her chair to refill it from the cooler in the hall outside her cubical. She drank a few sips from the refilled bottle and continued working.
About an hour&#039;s work later Joni&#039;s bladder was very full and she decided to finish off her paragraph…</p>

While my mom had really tried to get me dry, and eventually forbade me to use diapers, I had hardly moved to my first own apartment when I ran out to purchase large amounts of diapers and everything that was needed besides them. Since the day had been exhausting, I had gone to bed early and happily in diapers. My subconscious seemed to have grasped the fact, for that night I wasn&#039;t plagued by bad dreams of searching desperately for a toilet, while the pressure in my bladder grew worse and worse – but I guess you know this type of nightmares. No, I slept like a log…</p>

        <p class="card-text">I was told to go to the toilet before we left, but I didn&#039;t.When we got to the park, I was asked to look after my younger sisters. I was wearing black knickers, a blue skirt down to my knees, and a white T–shirt. After a while, I began to feel the need to pee. I ignored it, and I continued to watch my sisters. My family said they were going home for an hour, leaving me on my own with them, a responsibility thing they said. After a short while, I really needed to pee. I crossed my legs, which helped, but it couldn&#039;t hold for long. I could feel the pressure on my bladder; it was sort of a dead weight. This didn&#039;t help too much, because it seemed to sink down. I knew where the toilets were; it was just that I…</p>
