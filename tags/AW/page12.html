        <p class="card-text">Bright sun shone over the fields that mellow spring Saturday morning. Anne felt a quiet sense of satisfaction as she drove homewards. She&#039;d busily spent the morning helping her best friend Wendy host a coffee morning and had poured countless cups of coffee. The purpose of the coffee morning had been to raise funds for new loos for the community hall in Wendy&#039;s village. It had to be said that the old ones had become rather grotty and badly needed replacement. The sooner funds could be raised; the sooner work could begin on replacing them. Anne only ever remembered using them once – during the interval of a concert – and on that occasion she&#039;d needed to do more than pee. Had she only needed to pee she&#039;d have…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Hello, I&#039;m 38 and I&#039;m an Italian–American living on the west coast...but this story is not about myself. It&#039;s a story about a girlfriend that I had once... her name was Lindsay (that&#039;s not her real name of course) and we were both 19 back then. I won&#039;t waste time trying to describe her, but I tell you she was very pretty. Picture her as you will ;) We had been dating for almost two years so we were pretty comfortable talking about just about everything. One thing that I noticed was that she had a small bladder, like, she always had to go to the bathroom very often.
She was the kind of girl who would come out of a movie almost peeing her pants or would have to stand up and go pee in the middle of the movie. So…</p>

John Gallagher gave her a reproving glance as she rejoined him. &quot;Keep under cover before somebody sees you,&quot; he warned in a harsh whisper.
&quot;I can&#039;t help it,&quot; Allison snapped. &quot;I&#039;m dying for the loo.&quot;
&quot;Look,&quot; Gallagher said, &quot;If someone looks out of the back windows of that warehouse and sees you strutting up and down out here, the whole operation will be blown.&quot;
&quot;Alright, alright,&quot; Allison conceded. &quot;I just hope something happens soon, because I can&#039;t wait much longer.&quot;

Three hours ago she&#039;d been shopping in town, in her short, tight red top that she still wore, and her cut off denim shorts, which had been stolen whilst she was being accused of shoplifting in a store, along with her handbag. Now she was just wearing a tight yellow bikini bottom to cover her most private parts. The large coke that she&#039;d drank over two hours ago was now stretching her bladder, and she was trying to walk home, not having money for a bus and not being allowed into a store to use the facilities in her bare feet and legs. It wasn&#039;t a bad outfit to walk round in during the summer – she liked to tease…</p>

Helen had devoted her Saturday to watching all three parts of Peter Jackson&#039;s &quot;Lord of the Rings.&quot; I watched most of it with her, especially the third part of the trilogy. The fun began about an hour before the end of the film. Even though we were watching it at home and could pause the DVD at any time, Helen didn&#039;t like to take breaks during movies since, in her view, it killed the atmosphere.
She had been leaning her head on my shoulder for about half an hour when I noticed her rubbing her hand against her stomach. &quot;Eaten too much?&quot; I asked.
&quot;Ssshhh,&quot; she said suppressively, so I didn&#039;t think any more of it for a while. After another ten minutes or so, however, I…</p>

The polished hardwood floor of the ballroom glistened; the lights from the chandeliers overhead were reflected in the varnish of the wood. Spacious, the room stretched from one end of the old mansion to the other, high ceilings adorned with artwork, sculptures embedded in the royal columns that supported the old roof. A long bar, covered in black velvet formed the right border of the room, in the back, a double doorway led to the hallway of the old mansion. Before the doorway, still in the ballroom, a small antique table with an old lamp on it and a set of ledgers…</p>

The rain beat down remorselessly on the fly sheet of the tent while Helen tossed and turned in a vain attempt to get to sleep; but try as she might she could not get comfortable. Eventually, remembering something she had once read about the sleep–inducing qualities of the female orgasm, she gently lifted the hem of the long pink cotton T–shirt which had served her as a her night dress during her camping holiday with Andy, and slipped her hand down inside the front of her knickers.

Her wrists were tied behind her, fastened to her ankles. There was a rope around her knees, pulling them apart, and she was slightly suspended from above, where ropes under her arms held her up. Her body was arched back, pushing out her breasts, and her legs were apart enough that Thy knew the men would be looking at her pussy.
Occasionally she heard murmurs from behind the glass, and caught a word of English here and there. Thy was Japanese, and was in the country on a student exchange program…</p>

        <p class="card-text">As shopping sprees went, it hadn&#039;t been a particularly good one. Sarah had found little to interest her, and wished now that she had done something different with her Saturday. True, she had found a few small items of lingerie in J. C. Penny, but not much else. She had consoled herself with lunch at an eatery on the top floor of the mall calling itself the Cottage Garden. It was pretentious and overpriced, but she did enjoy the lasagne and Caesar salad, accompanied by what the proprietors claimed was tea made the proper English way, Earl Grey in a large white tea pot, all to herself.
The highlight of the lunch had been when a handsome guy had asked to share her table. They had chatted, and Sarah had crossed…</p>

Cultural Anthropology was always so boring, and today he had been even more anxious for it to be over because he really had to go to the bathroom. He&#039;d had a big breakfast and didn&#039;t get the chance to relieve himself before coming to class like he normally does, so he was getting rather uncomfortable by the end of Professor Johnson&#039;s lecture.
A crowd of students began milling around the professor to ask him about the day&#039;s notes, but Chris was lucky enough to push out of the classroom before they started blocking the door. He…</p>

She moaned loudly, sounding like a wounded cat as she did so. Another bead of sweat rolled down her forehead, her bare legs clenched together, tightly, tensed, her pulse quickening, breathing rapid, eyes dilated, face twisted. Her left hand waved through dark brunette hair, tied up in a single ponytail that flopped against her back and then rapidly grasped her thigh, finger–nails biting clutching her skin. Her body twitched, she shivered. Goose bumps rose on her bare legs, the cool air chilling her. She struggled again, breath held tight, eyes widening as the pressure came again. Stinging. Pulsing. She twitched violently, the shrieking pain…</p>
