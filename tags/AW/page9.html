        <p class="card-text">There was a new Mexican place that my friend insisted I just had to try. I had my doubts since she&#039;s never been into spicy food. Then it dawned on me. Tammy broke her ankle a few days back and she probably had a bad case of cabin fever. There was no way I could turn her down, even in the middle of a busy Sunday.
I have to admit Tammy looks very cute on crutches. She&#039;s petite and wears these pleated mini skirts that give her the prep school girl look even though we&#039;re older than that. Everyone was very courteous at the restaurant, holding the door open for her and giving her sympathetic smiles.
I&#039;m technically hotter, but she looks younger and more endearing. I was glad I wore my tank top and really short…</p>

When the Authority created my position, it was in advance of suitable offices being built at a number of locations throughout the county. The situation on my patch was no different, and for the first year in the job, I had to work out of a large portacabin.
The portacabin was not as grim as it might sound. It was well appointed, with reasonable office furniture, plenty of heat, microwave and kettle, and so on. The only questionable thing about this mobile office was that the powers that be…</p>

It all started when a friend and I had to fly from Scotland to London for work. We were running late leaving the office to catch the plane. I had said to Lucy that I was bursting for the loo, and she said that she needed to go too, but she said the taxi was waiting and there was no time because we were running late so we had to leave now!

        <p class="card-text">On a warm, calm spring evening, Steph decides to go for a bike ride. There are no good bike trails around her house so she drives to a trail entrance, parks, and takes out her bike. Pushing her long, blonde hair out of view, she gets on and begins to ride. She hasn&#039;t been out for a couple weeks and it feels good. Her athletic, 23–year old body responds well to her vigorous pedalling and she speeds along, aerodynamic in a relatively thick purple cycling bib with a tight long–sleeve purple and black shirt over top.
She remembers that she probably should have gone to the bathroom before leaving, but she thinks that she&#039;ll have to learn to hold her bladder if she wants to do well in serious long–distance races.…</p>

My name is Julia. Though I&#039;m still in high school, since I&#039;m now 18, I feel liberated, in that now I can share my experiences with others. This story is about my first experience, when I first learned that peeing and watching others pee was such a turn–on for me.
Though I like boys, I like peeing with other girls more than anything else in the world, and in that aspect, I guess I&#039;m somewhat of a bisexual. This story is told in the third person. I chose to write it this way so that I could include every event that took place, since I wasn&#039;t in the same room as some of the other girls when they peed.
Chloe, Claire, Julia, Ashley and Dani were all going over to Eliza&#039;s house…</p>

I have been living in Portland, Oregon for some time now and I like to go out and have a drink at a bar called Thatcher&#039;s. I have never known where the restroom is and as I particularly don&#039;t like to use the toilet anyway I have never asked.
Well one day I left home and caught a bus. I stood out at that bus stop for what seemed forever when I began to realize I needed to go pee. I was meeting someone at Thatcher&#039;s and didn&#039;t want to be late so I decided to wait until I got to the bar and hopefully would find a quiet corner to pee in. As the bus came down the hill I was dancing back and forth trying…</p>

One day, 19–year–old Allie was sitting home alone in the summer time, just hanging out in her short denim skirt and pink camisole (and if you were looking up her skirt you would see her dark blue cotton bikini panties.) She sat there on the couch bored, watching TV and sipping at her Coke. She was quite a naughty and promiscuous girl, and got anyone she wanted when she wanted them...it wasn&#039;t too hard for her; all she had to do was throw her long, brunette hair over her shoulder and smile her shiny lips at somebody, show off her perfect white teeth with the glitter in her brown eyes and she had them.

All three girls were slim and fairly lightly built. The three girls had gone to secondary school together, and having just finished sixth form, were enjoying their summer before they went away to university.

She was allowed to move out at age 18 so she found a nice castle thousands of miles away from the King and Queen and decided to move there.

She had also always wanted some personal companions who would keep her company and who would be her friends if she so wanted them to. So she looked through the phone book to find what she was looking for. She came upon a rather odd listing. There was a picture of four women in their 20&#039;s who were offering to come live with someone and attend to their every need, including just being a companion or best friend if so…</p>

Were going to a party tonight!&quot; She stands up, from sitting on the edge of the bed, and walks over to the bathroom, Nick is running water, washing his razor blade as he stands there looking in the mirror half shaven, using the mirror he looks over.
&quot;Who&#039;s having the party?&quot; He asks.
&quot;Oh Trev, apparently it&#039;s HUGE, everyone will be there!&quot; Nick rolls his eyes, and smiles.
&quot;Alrighty, what time?&quot;
&quot;Well, we could go early I thought, We could have a few drinks here before we go too, I wanted to drink that Chambord, I would take it but I don&#039;t want those assholes to get their hands on it, so we&#039;ll start drinking here, and…</p>

        <p class="card-text">It took only a few minutes for Marianne to return. She was dressed in casually cut, but a size too small jeans and a pink, wide cut tank top showing the laces and upper parts of her not color matching white bra. Still, the d&#039;collet&#039; gave a good impression of her large breasts. Laura wondered how she was going to support her apparently heavy backpack for hours, the straps directly rubbing on her skin. The jeans were apparently old, since the zipper didn&#039;t close all the way, making the jeans bulge out a bit below the beltline.
&quot;Here I am!&quot; Marianne said, &quot;And I brought a few bottles of water and some food for a picnic.&quot;
&quot;Okay, then let&#039;s go – we have provisions, too.&quot; The women answered and together they set…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Oh no, I woke up too late!
Glanced at the clock, quarter past eight
I hurried into my pink panties and short skirt
Covered up my C cup titties with a tight shirt
Grabbed a quick bite and drink
Already need to pee, but no time to I think
I rush quickly out the door
Already getting desperate for sure
I made it to the bus stop just in time
Got another soda, this one lemon &amp; lime
I let my blonde hair fall down
So beautiful all the other girls cried and frowned
I felt my bladder start to fill up
Hoping I could make it to my bus stop
So thirsty I had to drink another one
Crossing my legs now, this should be fun
Wriggling my legs while sitting on the bus
Hoping to not wet myself and make a fuss

        <p class="card-text">It was my first day as a receptionist. I looked at myself in the mirror. I wore a nice purple wool skirt, nice and tight to just above my knees then flared out a bit to just below my knee, a tight purple sweater that flattered my figure, underneath, a white satin lace–trimmed slip, sheer control top pantyhose, and matching lace–trimmed purple satin panties and bra. Everything was nice and tight, just like I liked it. I especially enjoyed the feel of my tight panties, pressing in my clitoral hood and the feel of the satin against my labia was delicious.
I drank another glass of water before leaving....
Traffic was bad and the suburban bus was running late– all the coffee and water were adding up as I felt my…</p>
