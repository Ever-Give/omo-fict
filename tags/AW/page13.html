        <p class="card-text">It&#039;s another down day at work, so I thought I&#039;d tell you another story about myself. I also thought it be fun if I told you how desperate I was while I&#039;m writing this. Now because I&#039;m at work I can&#039;t just write this whole thing out at once. Someone could come by and interrupt me, or something might come up. Usually when I write a story at work it takes most of the day. Right now it&#039;s 10am. I got here at 7am. Like all slow days it&#039;s tough to stay awake, and since I&#039;m new here I don&#039;t think it would be good for me to be found sleeping at my desk. So like everyone else to stay at least a little awake I&#039;ve been having lots of coffee. Well you might not consider 2 cups a lot, but it is for me. Add to this the 24oz…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Note: This story contains Male Desperation, Accidental (Male) Wetting, and Humiliation.
Mrs. Hauser was my PE coach in college. She was known for being a real bitch, and for having an incredible ass that she always showed off in tight jeans and skin–tight sweat pants. She developed the bitch reputation for not allowing people to leave to use the restroom in her class.
Inevitably, once or twice a year, she&#039;d make some poor freshman wet their pants in front of the entire class without fail. She seemed to get some type of sadistic pleasure out of watching you squirm until you flooded the pants you were wearing. She was especially mean to the guys, as I unfortunately found out my senior year in college.

        <p class="card-text">Laura, an ambitious young woman, had decided to expand her skills by taking night classes at her local college to obtain a diploma in business studies, a qualification which would enable her to go after a more demanding and better–paid job than the tedious office assistant style stuff she was doing at present. Night classes took their toll, however. Starting at six p.m., she had very little time to get across town from work and rarely arrived in the classroom on time. She hated being late, and besides, her repeated late arrivals were beginning to irritate her tutor, Dr. Edwin White.
Laura was late again this evening because her idiot boss had insisted on having her finish redesigning the filing system, not…</p>

What was he doing here?? How had this happened!!?? The bailiff&#039;s voice continued, droning on in that official monotone reserved for officers of the law. Finally the explanation of charges was complete and the courtroom grew tense, quiet, as the judge&#039;s voice grimly intoned. &quot;How do you plead?&quot; Paul spat out the word &quot;innocent!&quot; in an exclamatory manner.

        <p class="card-text">Some people discover early on their proclivities towards watersports, but I came to mine when I was in college. I was on vacation in a resort town somewhere in the Pacific. I had just received my diving certification and was eager to get to it. Before I arrived I had booked several dives with a local company, and on the day of my &#039;discovery&#039; we were to make two dives, both along the reef wall. Of course I wouldn&#039;t be alone; five others had been booked in my group. By chance I knew three of them – Amy, Joan, and Mark – they were staying at my resort and we had talked and gotten to know each other two nights earlier in the lounge.

She pulled off her sexy purple nightie and threw it on the floor. Going through her dresser, she pulled out a cute black thong with a pink smiley face that winked and said &quot;Don&#039;t You Wish&quot; across it. As she pulled it up, a blast of cold air came in through the window that made her shiver and she reached across and closed it. She then went into her closet and pulled on a denim…</p>

But she couldn&#039;t quite put her finger on what it was that was wrong. It was a sensation – a feeling – that was at once familiar and unfamiliar, but which she was sure she oughtn&#039;t to be feeling. Not here. Not now. But what was it?
She took a moment to consider her surroundings. What was the anomaly? She was in bed. Not her bed; a double bed. That was as it should be: she remembered Sam offering to let her stay for the night and showing her up to the large, inviting double bed.
There was a body asleep beside her in the bed. Jenny peeped under the bedclothes and saw the outline of two well proportioned…</p>

Max is driving (it&#039;s his car) and Barbara is sitting beside him, while I&#039;m behind her and by my side is Michele. Well, &quot;travelling&quot; is really just an expression, because we left the Zoo an hour ago and we&#039;re still half way from home, stuck on the highway in the middle of a traffic jam. For Max and I it&#039;s just an inconvenience, but for the ladies it&#039;s much worse. They&#039;re both dying for a pee, and they can&#039;t do anything about it but try to hold on.
All of this started when we were at the Zoo. As it was a Monday on a holiday weekend and also…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Helen sat on her rucksack, looking at her watch and tapping her feet. She was irritated. No, worse, she was angry. It was quarter to eleven. Their coach left at five to. &quot;Meet at Drummer Street at half ten.&quot; That was what Andy had said. But where the hell was he? Helen had passed on a second cup of tea at breakfast in order to be here on time. If only she&#039;d known Andy was going to be late, she needn&#039;t have done that. And it wasn&#039;t as if she needed to exercise restraint for the sake of her bladder, either. They&#039;d been assured that the Norwich service always ran the most modern coaches with toilets and everything.
A red Ford Escort clattered to a halt by the kerb in front of her. Its engine didn&#039;t sound at all…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Claire carefully adjusted her top so that it would reveal as much of her cleavage as possible, and then bent down to help little Hannah take her dress off. As she did so, she peered over the rim of her sunglasses at the handsome young man on the opposite side of the courtyard. He&#039;d noticed her, she was sure of that: but what was it he wanted to see? That was the question. Tits or legs? Well, she thought, as she gathered the girls&#039; dresses together, I can always make sure he gets a good eyeful of both, just to make sure.
&quot;Right, monsters,&quot; she said, giving Jane a friendly pat on the bottom as she did so. The girls all giggled. They liked it when Claire called them monsters. &quot;You can go and play in the…</p>

I&#039;ve been reading the stories on this site since I was 18, it was such a relief for me that I wasn&#039;t the only one who was into holding my pee till I was about to or actually did wet myself. I kept meaning to share my personal experiences but I always seemed to get side tracked. Usually when I started to tell a story I&#039;d get so excited remembering what happened that well...I didn&#039;t have any fingers available for typing ;) But now I&#039;m 23 and at work, bored a lot, and I have a little more self–control. Not to say writing this isn&#039;t a major turn on but it&#039;s not like I can just put my hand up my skirt. There are tons of…</p>

        <p class="card-text">20–year–old Shelly never could stand the sound of running water ever since she was a little girl. Even when she goes to the gas station she has to hold her crotch like a little girl because the faint sound of the gasoline running through the pump sends almost uncontrollable impulses to pee right through her. Even when she just gets done peeing, if she flushes the toilet she needs to go again; she also has to cross her beautiful legs very tightly to wash her hands.
And speaking of her beautiful legs, they look ever so sexy today. Nice and tan...you can look at them until her short baby blue fuzzy shorts don&#039;t allow you to look any more (and those shorts don&#039;t hide too much.) The shorts definitely showed off…</p>
