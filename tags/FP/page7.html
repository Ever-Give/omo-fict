        <p class="card-text">I&#039;d like to tell you about some of the strange things that happened to me after I went to college. I went to a different state, with two of my best friends, and our parents bought a house for us to live in. They did it on a few conditions. We had to maintain the building (they would pay back the bills, but we had to arrange the repairs and if we could do them ourselves. We had to progress in college, so no partying all night, each night. We had to come back home on a regular basis and finally we had to take care of the bills. We didn&#039;t have to pay rent, but they didn&#039;t give us any money to live off of (they did pay college tuition and our books and stuff). We thought it to be a good deal and we took it. We had…</p>

        <p class="card-text">22–year–old Amy walked out of history class with her 19–year–old friend Jordan. They both knew they turned heads as the guys looked at Amy&#039;s fine figure in her tight blue jeans and crop top with her brunette hair tied up in a bun and Jordan in her short miniskirt and tank top, her shiny red hair reaching down to her shoulder blades.
&quot;Ha, those guys always trip over their shoelaces every time we walk out of a room,&quot; Jordan said. &quot;How the hell are we single?&quot;
&quot;Oh, speaking of guys,&quot; Amy said, &quot;I&#039;m having a little get together tonight in my dorm room.&quot;

        <p class="card-text">&quot;Hanna Evans, come on down!&quot; exclaimed the familiar voice. After more than two years of trying to get tickets, design a costume and the ordeal of auditions, the cute young housewife in the pigtails and the schoolgirl plaid skirt had often thought this moment would never come. Her white blouse and short, very short, skirt really accented her youthful figure. Hanna leapt to her feet and made her way to the stage, her plaid skirt flying, revealing glimpses of white cotton panty as she took steps two at a time. The camera operator, used to all manner of spectacle at the show, was distracted in spite of his experience and drew in close as Hanna&#039;s panties again made an appearance. &quot;Sweet, sweet, sweet!&quot; he spoke…</p>

        <p class="card-text">It&#039;s a long–assed way from the nation&#039;s armpit to its belly button. We were driving all the way from home (NE, US) to southern Indiana, where we planned to ride our bikes (along with 250 other bike nuts) hundreds of miles through the hill country. We decided to split the drive into 2 days and play along the way. Early on the morning of day 2 we stopped in Wal–Mart to pick up another camp chair so there would be someplace to sit at the end of the day...just in case. After we found the perfect chair, and restocked the cooler with water and soft drinks, I started for the checkout line.
But OSO headed me off, herding me instead to the pharmacy section. He&#039;d never been in this town before in his life, but he…</p>

Kristine had two fingers pressing on the track&#039;s hard surface, her other arm cocked at her left side. Her Nike track shoes were pressed against the starting blocks, white socks barely showing above the edge of the shoe line, her calve muscles taut, her perfectly shaped, sleek yet athletic thighs tensed as she awaited the starting gunshot. A slight sheen of perspiration shone on her legs and arms. A single drop of perspiration fell from her nose, falling to the tracks surface, a small dark circle where it fell. Crouched in starting stance, her face stared down the straightaway of the track, her butt sticking up in the air, her short green nylon…</p>

Hell, even Jane had no idea what was soon to come. Sitting in Jane&#039;s car, Annie could barely contain her excitement. Jane was always the wild one, doing crazy things for attention. One time she set her lawn on fire, just to get her parents&#039; attention, so she could show them what she had learned in dance class that day. But Annie admired Jane, for she did what Annie could only hope to do, and Jane usually did it for her as well. As they pulled into the mall parking lot, Annie&#039;s stomach starting jumping and fluttering inside of her. Annie had never been to this part of town, although…</p>

Josie went on to tell me that their mum &amp; dad had gone away for the weekend and that they had the place all to themselves. &quot;We wondered whether you would like to come over and play rude with us,&quot; she asked.

At the senior prom dance that June evening in the mid–1950s, I danced only with Maddy, a girl I&#039;d been going with for about a year. We were kindred spirits, similar interests, but where I was shy and retiring, she was bubbly and outgoing. I was very comfortable with her. She drew me out and helped me overcome my shyness. However, we never had sex.

My wife Ashley and I started going out when we were 16 and have been together ever since. She&#039;s hot, blond with a killer figure. Ashley is the kind of girl everyone likes, she&#039;s sweet, kind and very sexy, and I&#039;m very protective of her. I have seen her desperate to pee about three times in our relationship, and one of them was at school. She knows that it&#039;s my fantasy to see her like this, but she very never does it, so I was surprised the other day.
I woke up at ten on Saturday and looked at my sexy wife. She is shopping obsessed, and has a dozen things to sleep in, but…</p>

We told each other everything, so it was only natural that she told me about how peeing made her come. I told her that I was the exact same way, and within a few months of meeting, we became lovers. We would always go to each other&#039;s houses, or drive somewhere secluded, and act out our most wild fantasies. One day, on the way to a most often deserted field, our most memorable experience occurred. We had started the day by drinking lots of coffee like we always did. Then we got into the car, she was driving, and turned on the radio. Usually, we managed to hold our pee without leaking…</p>

        <p class="card-text">As she watched her mom pull out of the driveway, Becca could hardly contain her excitement. She had waited all morning for this. She had started the day by drinking lots and lots of coffee, telling her mom that she needed to wake herself up to study for her finals. As she sat down at the computer now, she started to look at sites with pictures– pictures of girls wetting their panties, pictures of girls masturbating, and even pictures of girls humping each other. How she longed to do the same. Her clit began to tingle.
Her mom had told her to do the laundry. Now she had a wonderful idea. She made her way into the laundry room, and decided to do a load of jeans. She picked up the first pair, and put them on.…</p>

Hi, I&#039;m Renee, a 28–year–old chemist with Everett Pharmaceuticals. I first saw Gabriele at the company ladies&#039; softball game. She was medium tall, like me, mid twenties with short red hair, and she was clearly unsure of herself as she stood there while sides were being chosen. But I noticed something else besides her shyness. Her thighs and biceps looked strong...this woman worked out. No one else seemed to notice though, and she was chosen last by the other team.
She did not play until the last two innings. At bat with one out and a runner on first, she swings well and hits the ball hard. But it is right at our second baseman who catches it and then catches the runner off first..…</p>

        <p class="card-text">We were young and innocent. She was nineteen and I was twenty–three when we moved into the small cheap flat after going steady for three years. No need to bore you with the story of second–hand furniture and the roaming of garage sales, we were soon ready to live happily ever after. Karin was of average height, with brown curls to her breasts, green eyes and a nice girly shape. She preferred jeans and a sweater, but wore the occasional dress to feel womanlier. I&#039;m an ordinary guy. The most out–of–the–ordinary about me she didn&#039;t know about. We had a good sex life when we first started, enjoying each other regularly. But the thing that really turned me on was – well, I didn&#039;t have the nerve to tell her. I had…</p>

        <p class="card-text">&quot;Mmmmm,&quot; Annie groaned as the pressure in her belly grew. Secretly though, she enjoyed it. This was what she wanted. She had waited all week for this day, when her parents would be out for the day, about 8 hours. That gave her plenty of time to do what she wanted, and clean it all up too. She would lay in bed at night, softly stroking her young pussy, and think about the day that would come, when she could live out her most wild fantasies. Her friend Jane was on her way...
Jane was into peeing too. Both she and Annie were only 18, but they had known each other since they were 5. They went through the everyday accidents of accidentally peeing in their pants when they were little. If one wet her pants, the…</p>

        <p class="card-text">I had known Sam for about 5 years when I had my first encounter. But I almost never slept over at other people&#039;s houses, and had never stayed at her house too late. She had also never slept at my house either. So when my parents said they would be out of town that weekend, but weren&#039;t planning on taking me with them, I was excited– it sounded like the perfect opportunity to have the sleepover with Sam that I had been waiting to have. Sam&#039;s parents were going to visit her older sister, who had just had a new baby, so they would be gone as well, which left us either house available for our sleepover. Sam decided that she wanted me to stay with her at her house instead of coming to mine– and for some reason she…</p>
