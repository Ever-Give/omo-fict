        <p class="card-text">Saturday night and Lemonade was packed from wall to wall with gorgeous girls. Stella looked around her in wonder. Her London friends had been right; Lemonade was definitely Manchester&#039;s hottest lesbian nightclub. Quality tunes pulsed from the decks and quality girls filled every corner. Serious female talent stretched from the strobing dance floor to the secluded alcoves where several sets of faces were already pressed together.
A girl, that was what Stella needed now. There was definitely enough to choose from. Some possibilities had already caught her gaze– maybe the strawberry blonde at the bar, or the little Chinese girl. Yes, the little Chinese girl in the even smaller tight white dress had definitely…</p>

        <p class="card-text">She could make me do anything.
I first saw her at an early–morning swim. We were the first to arrive, before the hall filled up. She was swimming with slow, easy strokes, doing flip–turns and sliding under water, long hair streaming. She was wearing a red, high–cut swimsuit, emphasizing her slender, well–trained body. I went in, doing the best I could, but found her passing me again and again. I had to admire the elegant way she moved in the water.
Suddenly she was gone. I decided it was time to return to the dressing room.
We were still alone. She stood under the shower, back to me, washing her hair. She looked to be in her early forties, but very fit for her age, with slim waist, tight buttocks and just a…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Sue Frederick took a shallow breath and tried to maintain her composure. She had not accounted for the extra pressure on her bladder from the huge soft drink her employee had ordered for each of them at lunch. It had fallen in well with her plan so she had said nothing. Now she was beginning to wonder about her timing, to say nothing of her bladder capacity. Reminding herself of her goal, she gave herself a quick caress between her legs, then another because it felt sooo good the first time. Art would not know what hit him!
At 135 pounds on a five foot three inch frame, the dark haired accounting supervisor could have been a bit chubby, but Sue had been blessed with a firm, ample bust topped by richly dark…</p>

        <p class="card-text">A Wet Sex fantasy based on a real experience
I was a desperately horny 18– year– old virgin guy, a Private in the Military, posted at an out of the way air base. The ratio of men to women on the base was about 15 to 1. There was a small town nearby, but to attract a girl there one had to surpass both competition from the military men and all the local competition. Us &#039;Pigeons&#039; as the local town boys called us– were highly resented for hitting on the local girls. I&#039;m not saying it was impossible to date a woman, but although I wasn&#039;t ugly, I did have an acne problem at that age. This certainly didn&#039;t help when the competition was so fierce, and I was also shy knowing that I wasn&#039;t as attractive as some of the…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Deirdre was late for work. She rushed out of bed at around 7:45am, got washed and changed into a navy blue business top and knee–length skirt with a white blouse and black shoes. She felt a slight twinge in her bladder, but ignored it because she felt she would use the toilet when she got to work.
However, when she got to her local station, she had to wait twenty minutes for the train. By this time, she felt the need to go even more and started slight fidgeting on the spot. She looked for a toilet at the station and found one, but when she walked to the toilet door, she couldn&#039;t open it– the sign on the front said &quot;Out of Order&quot;.
The train eventually came, but it was crowded with passengers. She was already…</p>

Visitors from other regions are frequently overwhelmed by the explosive profusion of vines and flowers covering every tree, bush, and lawn, providing not only a dazzling kaleidoscope of color but also filling the air with intoxicating scents. At night, when the whippoorwills keen their haunting refrain and the warm breeze rustles the branches and Spanish moss in the high, twisted oaks, the South can seem like a universe apart from the dirt and bustle of modern America.

        <p class="card-text">We married quite young; I was twenty–one and Tracy was twenty. I had admired her shapely body in the tight jeans for some time before things fell into place and we started dating. We got married within a year.
I first met her sister at the wedding. Lynn was eighteen with a slender body, usually dressed in tight, short dresses and skirts, or leggings and t–shirt. Tracy didn&#039;t mind me noticing her sister. Isn&#039;t she cute? She used to say, &quot;don&#039;t you just love her?&quot; Not as much as I love you, was my truthful answer.
The summer after the wedding we spent two weeks at Tracy&#039;s family&#039;s summerhouse by the sea. One day Lynn turned up unexpectedly. &quot;Time to check out the happy couple,&quot; she said. &quot;Still in love?&quot;

I had taken on the job of building a new terrace on my uncle&#039;s summer house, a combination vacation and summer job.

I hefted a crowbar and tried to look mean.

It had been after a long night of incredible (and I mean *incredible*) sex with my fianc&#039;. I woke up before he did, sat up in bed, and just watched him sleep. God, he was so gorgeous. Then, I felt the urge to pee. It wasn&#039;t too bad, just one of those morning pees. I was about to get up, but he woke up. We smiled at each other and I cuddled up next to him. He playfully started kissing me, but I was distracted because my urge to pee was getting stronger –– a LOT stronger. As he started to gently kiss down my stomach, I knew I had to go relieve myself. I think he saw my discomfort and figured out that I had to pee.

She called herself Gypsy Goddess, and I her Gypsy King. The effervescent mind of this young Up–Easter would not be confined to the humdrum drudgery of rural central Florida, try as she might.
Nonetheless, I was largely unprepared for the flood of flaming femininity that accosted me, and I say accosted because I was almost immediately swept off–balance, when I first met her face to face.
The experience can only be described as slightly hallucinatory. Her youthful beauty stood much more profoundly in evidence than I had imagined from her conversation and pictures,…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Tina drifted slowly out of sleep. Her first thought was: Where am I? Her second: I have to go to the bathroom. Then she remembered. It was her first night in her aunt Jenny&#039;s incredibly big house, where she was going to spend the summer while working in the local bookshop before going back to school. She stared at the high ceiling, feeling the pressure in her bladder. Where was the bathroom, again? Tina decided to try to go back to sleep and wait until the morning.
When she awoke again she had dreamed of walking in the woods, finding a secluded place, lifting her skirt, and... She realized that she had nearly wet the bed. Clamping her hand to her crotch she tried to remember where to go to find a toilet. It…</p>

        <p class="card-text">This is an adaptation of a true story––– some things have been altered a bit for better flavor.
The last time I got together with my friend Carol, it was a chance meeting that had us both on my motorcycle in the mountains and finished with the best sex ever. Carol was determined that we would meet again, only on her turf next time...
Well, It so happened that I had to go on a trip to visit a relative and it put me just a few hours from where Carol was now living. I called her to let her know and she was really excited. She started to tell me all the things she was going to plan and I had to shut her up. I wanted to be surprised instead.
This time, I followed the directions to where Carol was going to be and…</p>

He says I shouldn&#039;t because our ages are so different. All I can do is tell you what went on last time we met and hope that someone can offer a solution.
Robert has a boat and spends his life floating around the canals of England. Last weekend he asked me to meet him near Burton–on–Trent at 6 on Friday evening. After work I had a really good drink and caught the train. By 6 I had been on the way for 2 hours and it was another half hour walk to his boat. There&#039;s probably a lot of nice respectable people in Burton so they were probably rather shocked by seeing us…</p>

While cruising around the canals of England I stopped for the night in rural Warwickshire and wandered back along the towpath for a mile or so to an eighteenth century pub for a pint or two. On the way back the urge to pee arrived which is never a problem either in the country or on a boat, there&#039;s hardly ever anyone around. Being a half decent sort of chap I hopped over a gate into a field of sheep and had just opened up when a voice shouted, &quot;There he is.&quot; I closed…</p>

        <p class="card-text">I have had this girlfriend for almost two years now but it has been just phone sex and hours of Internet foreplay. But... not long ago, we had the pleasure of a wild afternoon interlude and unbelievable watersport fun. This is a true story but it could be dangerous, so I wouldn&#039;t recommend it to everyone.
Twenty–five years ago, we lived in the same town and we were lovers and roommates at the time but it just wasn&#039;t right for a long–term relationship. We broke up and I never heard from her again. She was really wonderful; it was I who was the jerk.
Almost two years ago though, I found her on line as I was surfing some Internet site–– I couldn&#039;t believe it. We spent nearly a year getting caught up on the…</p>
