        <p class="card-text">Andy looked at Helen in amazement. &quot;Surely you&#039;re not wearing that for the flight home?&quot; he asked.
&quot;Why not?&quot; she replied. &quot;It&#039;s practical, isn&#039;t it?&quot;
&quot;Practical?&quot; Andy snorted. &quot;It&#039;s so short you&#039;ll flash your knickers to the whole plane every time you sit down, and you&#039;ll freeze when we arrive back at Luton. It&#039;s about five degrees in England at the moment, you know. Now, just run this past me again will you: where&#039;s the practicality in that?&quot;
&quot;It&#039;s short enough that nobody will notice if I pull it out from under my bum when I sit down. That&#039;s what&#039;s practical about it.&quot;
&quot;Ah!&quot; said Andy, shaking his head in bewilderment. &quot;It&#039;s obvious once you say it.&quot;

        <p class="card-text">It was another boring day, as always, 25–year–old Victoria thought as she sat on the edge of her bed. She sat there, letting the warm sun soak her through the windows, glistening on her tight, tan body. She ran her hand over her rock hard abs and smiled as she looked down at herself. She loved her body and she loved the attention it got. She didn&#039;t have a boyfriend but she loved fucking a different guy every night. She knew she was a total slut and didn&#039;t care. She sat there thinking how it was Thursday, wishing it were Friday so she could go clubbing. It wasn&#039;t worth going on Thursday nights, though; the clubs weren&#039;t even half packed.
Finally, she got off the bed and walked to the window in her light green…</p>

When I was eighteen, I spent four weeks in hospital after falling off a roof and breaking both arms, dislocating one and giving my back a nasty jolt. I spent quite a lot of this time with my arms encased in itchy plaster and suspended by wires to prevent me from moving them. I was lucky that my father had the kind of job that offered good medical cover, and I had a private room. To be honest, I would rather have been in one of the wards with other kids my age so that I would have had people to talk to, but since the insurance company was paying, my dad wanted me to have the best.
The hospital boasted some very…</p>

        <p class="card-text">I had a really bad day at work and wanted a little evening fun; so I decided to play hold it.
I had 40 ounces of water 1.5 hours ago and a couple of vodka tonics since. I am now a girl who has got to go! I am going to hold it as long as I can and then measure my capacity. My record is 1.1L. I will try to beat it without wetting on my nice hardwood floors. If I don&#039;t make it, you will probably hear the splash, as I really let it out when I go.
Oohh my God, I am trying to hold it, but I want to pee. I refuse to loosen my belt or unbutton my jeans. Grown ups can hold it and I am a grown up, a 35 year old woman, director at a major corporation. I will not let the pulsing of my bladder control me.

        <p class="card-text">It was one of those beach parties where everyone just assumes you know everybody else, so nobody ever bothers introducing you to anybody; but in reality you&#039;ve scarcely met anyone before in your life. It was originally intended as a small old chums&#039; get–together; but then friends started getting invited, and then friends of friends, and before we knew it there were close on two hundred people having a great time, eating lots of great food, and drinking lots of great drink. Most folk had brought rather more than a bottle and there was plenty to go around; so I just went with the flow and made the most of the opportunity to chill and enjoy myself.
The sun was setting, but there was still plenty of light. I was…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Trish gasped and slipped a hand between her legs. Her denim mini skirt was practically round her hips and Mark, sitting in the bus seat beside her with a protective arm around her shoulders, could have looked down and seen her knickers from crotch to waist had he wanted to. But he was too much of a gentleman, so he averted his eyes and tried to think of ways to help Trish hold on.
This was so not how Trish had wanted their first date to end. She had wanted to get to know Mark properly first, and then choose the right moment to tell him about her weak bladder and the problems it sometimes caused her. But now ... oh well, there was little point crying over spilt milk. She crossed her legs and clenched her thigh…</p>

There was no obvious sign of a ladies&#039; room anywhere. She glanced at her watch, crossed her legs tightly, and leaned forward a little. Then she looked around the pub once again, studying the demeanour of her fellow drinkers. Two or three of them were taking a more or less obvious interest in her; and one of those, in particular, stood out. He was about six feet tall with a shock of unruly sun–bleached hair, a heavily tanned face and sparkling green eyes that seemed to smile at her encouragingly every time she looked in his direction.

It had been a rough week at work and Nikki was ready for two days of relaxation and time with Tyler. To prepare herself she had been drinking lots of water all afternoon. Of course, she had had to pee several times in order not to embarrass herself at the office, but that was OK. She knew she was well hydrated and that she now only needed to drink a little to fill her bladder enough to make her hot and intensify her horniness.
She stopped in the staff kitchen on her way out of the office to fill up her water bottle and then headed out to the car. On the way home she fantasized about what she might do with Tyler tonight.…</p>

After a while, we were already deeply into the subject and had dropped in passing some information about the people we had met on our way. In one of my mails I had answered her question whether I knew people in Europe who were into watersports, too, in writing her that I had made very few such acquaintances. Actually, all I remembered was a summer I had passed in France working on a farm, a while ago. It was a small hamlet with just a farm, two houses and a small chapel in a picturesque landscape of small mountains and green valleys. Nice place to be on holidays,…</p>

Doctor Annabel Hart. The pretty young redhead&#039;s green eyes sparkled as she stared in amazement at the shingle hanging outside her office. She had thought, more than once, that this day would never come. Still, she had persevered, working long hours to support her schooling and even longer hours to pass medical school. The sleepless nights and heavy schedule had granted Annabel her most intense desire, but at the price of any social life. In fact she had no friends outside the stodgy little medical school she had attended. She thought it was worth it. Social opportunities would come when she…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Lee lies still, awake enough to know she needs to pee, but not enough to actually do anything about it. She watches as her friend Donna stirs in her sleep, moans, and goes quiet again. She and Donna are new friends; they have not yet learned the intimacies of the other&#039;s mannerisms and habits. Donna&#039;s covers are kicked back and Lee can see Donna&#039;s hand resting between her legs, where dark curls peek from under the crotch of her white panties. Donna&#039;s hand moves, ever so slightly, and she arches her back, just a bit.
Another moan. Lee wonders if the hand has anything to do with the moan. It doesn&#039;t surprise the 23–year–old blond to realize she, and apparently her nipples, like the idea that it does. She had…</p>

&quot;Shall I top that up for you, Em?&quot; Dave nodded towards Emma&#039;s half full pint glass, and held up a nearly full three–litre bottle of cider.
&quot;No, I&#039;m fine,&quot; Emma replied. &quot;I&#039;ve got to think about going soon or I&#039;ll miss the last train. But it&#039;s been a great party, Dave: really it has.&quot;
&quot;Last train&#039;s not for quarter of an hour yet,&quot; said Dave, checking his watch. &quot;It&#039;ll only take me a couple of minutes to run you down to the station in the car.&quot;
&quot;But you&#039;ve been drinking,&quot; Emma protested. &quot;I can walk it in ten minutes, so I&#039;ll be fine as long as I glug this down and make a start right away.&quot;
Dave looked a little…</p>

She looked at the monitor to see his flight&#039;s status. To her dismay, she found that it would be forty–five minutes late. She might as well sit somewhere and get a drink. She hesitated, having in mind that she hadn&#039;t peed since she left home about 2 hours ago and would have at least another 3 hours before she could use the bathroom again. Public bathrooms were absolutely out of the question! She had drunk down a bottle of water on her way to the airport…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Holly sat on the low wall and tried to breathe slowly to calm down as she reviewed her situation. Three hours ago she&#039;d been shopping in town, in her short, tight red top that she still wore, and her cut off denim shorts, which had been stolen whilst she was being accused of shoplifting in a store, along with her handbag. Now she was just wearing a tight yellow bikini bottom to cover her most private parts. The large coke that she&#039;d drank over two hours ago was now stretching her bladder, and she was trying to walk home, not having money for a bus and not being allowed into a store to use the facilities in her bare feet and legs. It wasn&#039;t a bad outfit to walk round in during the summer – she liked to tease…</p>
