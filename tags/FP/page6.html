        <p class="card-text">George Robinson, the scientist, is in his early 50&#039;s. He is clearly all about no–nonsense old school type research. George prides himself on his analytical skills and determination to get things done. Now, however, George is simply baffled. His latest device fails to work. He has checked and rechecked his design; this doesn&#039;t happen to him. Based on secret medical data, the device is intended to project a signal to enemy soldiers, which will be received directly into the brain. This signal is computer generated and intended to mimic human synaptic generation. The frequency projected is a type of biosynthetic feedback cycling sine wave, modulating throughout an identified human receptive range. Its purpose is…</p>

He had run his small jewelry store by himself since he opened a year ago, but business had picked up and he decided to get someone part time to help out. He thought Jenny was so cute but too young. She had a pretty smile and long blonde hair and a tiny sexy body. And she was wearing a cheerleader uniform.
&quot;Hello Mr. Thompson, I am Jenny. Amanda told me you needed somebody part time.&quot;

&quot;Yes Sir, we are in the same class at school.&quot;

        <p class="card-text">I&#039;ve always been a bit of a dirty girl. I like to piss my panties whenever I can and even better, I love to watch a hot sexy girl lose control and piss inside her clothes. This is exactly what happened to me last summer, when I was 18.
I was on a night out with a group of friends. I was already really horny because before I had gone out, I&#039;d taken a shower, making sure I was desperate before I got in. It turned me on so much to step away from the shower and let my piss go, running down the insides of my legs until I came with pleasure.
But when we arrived at the bus stop, I saw Sophie was there, looking gorgeous and sexy. Her wonderful, full breasts were pushing to escape from her strappy top and her blue…</p>

        <p class="card-text">We woke late, not surprisingly. When I opened my eyes, I found Julia&#039;s face before me, her head propped up on her hand. She smiled and rubbed her left leg against my thigh –– such a wonderful way to start the day and I did not suppress the groan at the pleasure it brought me. I reached down and stroked her thigh as it came within reach, relishing the softness of her skin.
&quot;That was quite a revelation last night,&quot; she said, smirking, her blue eyes peeping through the strands of her fringe. &quot;Why didn&#039;t you tell me about your.... interest before?&quot;
&quot;Why do you think?&quot; I said, shrugging slightly. &quot;I didn&#039;t think you&#039;d be interested. More likely, I thought it would scare you off.&quot;

When he&#039;d suggested tying her up for the evening, she had been excited. This kind of foreplay had such a profound effect on Michael and invariably led to the most amazing sex. She had agreed readily, and without giving her time to reconsider, Michael had promptly dragged into the bedroom and started tying her up.
&quot;You&#039;re keen,&quot; she had remarked as he bound her wrists and pulled up a chair to secure one end of the rope to the overhead beam, preventing her from sitting down. He had looked down at her from his precarious perch and waggled his…</p>

        <p class="card-text">My girlfriend Mary has always been interested in pee play. We&#039;ve done all the usual stuff and I was looking for a new way to spice up the action. One day we got a package in the mail that had freezer gel packs to keep the contents cold. I looked at those gel packs and looked at Mary. I told her the gel packs would be part of our next bladder control scene. She got a terrified look on her face because she knew exactly what I had in mind.
That night we went to the local tavern for dinner and a few brews. I told Mary not to pee because I wanted to feel her swollen and hard bladder before we made love. She does this often and it turns us both on. We had 3 or 4 beers that night. She had no problem avoiding the…</p>

She looked around once again while Andy drove the punt pole deep into the riverbed and looped the mooring chain around it. They were hove–to in the middle of a clear, shallow pool with a sand and gravel bottom. It was no more than fifty metres long, and perhaps thirty metres across at its widest point. Long strands of green weed streamed out in the current, and the occasional stickleback darted in and out between them. At the upstream end of the pool was an ugly concrete weir over which the river rushed headlong in an angry,…</p>

Her skirt had ridden up to reveal some of her beautifully nylon–clad legs. She was blindfolded. There was a piece of duct tape securing her mouth. She was pulling and writhing against the restraints in an effort to get herself out of the chair.
I removed the blindfold and I showed her my badge, and her eyes signaled her relief. From under the duct tape, she was trying to talk or scream to no avail. The crime scene investigators were on their…</p>

Alexis Chambers looked with distaste into the toilet bowl as she dropped the square of pee–dampened tissue into the yellow water. How she hated it when she did that! So disgusting! She always tried not to look. The 41–year–old newly remarried widow hoped her new husband would be as proper about such matters as her previous husband had been. Odd, it was probably the only characteristic she had liked about her recently departed, unmissed, and unmourned mate. Her life had gone from merely livable to torturous over the 21 years she had been Mrs. Thadius Rushmore Monroe. She could hardly remember him now as the man…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Three months after I first dated Julia Hayward, she came over from Winchester to Canterbury to spend a weekend with me at my house. She arrived on the down train from London where she worked as a secretary for a firm of solicitors. She had a flat in the middle class area near Mayfair, two streets over from Bakers Street where she worked, and enjoyed getting out of the city to spend her weekends with me in the country.
It was the country too since I didn&#039;t live right in Canterbury itself, but in the village of Wycliffe, about fifteen miles away, almost on the coast of the North Sea, the beach just a ten–minute walk away.

        <p class="card-text">I have always been into desperation peeing and playing games.
I could not get my wife interested in it at all. One night we went to a new bar to listen to a friend&#039;s band play. Little did I know that the ladies&#039; bathroom was under construction, as it was being completely remodeled. As the night went on and we were both drinking, my wife went to the ladies&#039; room to go to the bathroom. She didn&#039;t say anything when she returned, but as the night went on I saw in her all the signs of desperation. I asked her what was wrong and she said that she had to pee!
She said that there were no stalls, just toilets with no dividing walls, and she couldn&#039;t go like that. I told her I would take her outside and let her go,…</p>

        <p class="card-text">It was a bad day from the start for 22–year–old Alisha. When she woke up, her long brunette hair was all in clumps, and when she went to get out of bed her pajamas caught on the bed post and ripped right at the crotch. She wanted to cry, but figured she could just sew it later. As she walked into the bathroom, she noticed all her dirty clothes lying on the floor and knew that she had to go do laundry today. She quickly stepped in the shower and washed her hair, but it was still hard to brush when she came out.
She wrapped a towel around her tight body and walked to her dresser, where she found she had no clean clothes. She looked at the dirty laundry pile realizing how bad the day was going. She picked…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Let&#039;s just say, I wish this story were true!
I met Mary in an undergraduate maths lecture. I had noticed her since the start of term. Her long brown hair and fresh complexion made me catch my breath every time I saw her. That day, I managed to sit next to her at the lecture, and I remember being surprised that she wore a very alluring scent to lectures. Most female students left that until evening time!
In other ways, however, she was quite shy, however. She seemed completely focused on her work, and I could not help wondering if she was already dating someone. As luck would have it, I got to talk with her and discovered that although she certainly knew more math than me, she was having some trouble with her…</p>

        <p class="card-text">When I first met Gill, it was a mutual attraction. She was an attractive blond, quite tall and at the time innocent, or so I thought. We were soon beyond just kissing and cuddling and starting to become more adventurous. But even in those early days there was a hint of things to come, but I was slow to recognize it.
She had a lovely body (still has) and I enjoyed looking at it and playing with it, as she did mine. I should have taken more notice of something that happened every time we indulged in mutual masturbation.
Either she went to the bathroom first, or wanted to when she was near to climax, but put it off till after we had cum and then sprinted for the toilet. At that time our activities where…</p>

Flying the versatile F/A–18D Hornet, they could strike any target from tanks to ships to aircraft. The Squadron Leader was Andrea, a Navy Commander. Newly formed, they got their first assignment at sea, to a Nimitz–class carrier.
All but one of the ten squadron members flew out to the carrier on schedule. One of the aircraft had serious mechanical problems, and the pilot, Denise, had to stay behind while it was repaired, since there were no spare aircraft available. By the time it was finally fixed the carrier was halfway to its patrol station. Denise had to fly out to meet it, traveling several hours over the ocean. The…</p>
