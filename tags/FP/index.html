        <p class="card-text">This story contains Female Desperation, Humiliation, Female Wetting, Female Peeing, and Golden Showers. When I got home, no one was around, so I quietly went to my room, changed clothes and went straight to bed. There was so much to dream about: wet panties, soaked pussies, and overwhelming ladies! Two weeks passed and nothing had happened. The weather was rather rainy and I had chosen to ride my bike or hitch a ride whenever some neighbor&#039;s kid had the same hours as I did. But summer came back and so did my desire to pick up my clothes. Doubtless, Mom would ask for them now that the weather allowed wearing them again. And maybe there was something else that attracted me to that house with a birch tree in…</p>

A part of her now wished she had used the toilet before embarking on the weekly grocery shopping.But how urgent would her need to pee become? This morning, she had had quite some milk in her cereal, drank two glasses of fresh garden fruit smoothie &#039; there were just so many fruit in her garden &#039; and later she had slowly sipped through the contents of two bottles of mineral water whilst going about the normal house work. Too late she realized now that this comprised quite a quantity of liquid which had been slowly filtering through her system since.The last speed bump &#039; the movement vibrated through…</p>

After weeks of training and renovations to the bar, it was finally Grand Opening Day. Though it was Misty&#039;s bar, Kiran and Jamie felt as much a part of the project as she did. In fact, they had let Misty know that they were willing to work on tips alone if things didn&#039;t work out as well as planned at the start. However, Misty was hearing none of it– she was convinced the bar was going to be a great success.Misty had named it the &#039;Wild West Games Bar&#039;, which fit well with the old building located in the outskirts of town. However, the best part of the name was the neon sign. Misty had made it so only certain…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Kiran shivered with excitement as she carried Jamie&#039;s soaked bed covers downstairs to the laundry room. She could feel the wet warmness on her arms and took care not to let the bundle dampen her t–shirt. Jamie was in the washroom getting cleaned up after peeing her bed and as her first act as Kiran&#039;s master, she had instructed her to put the wet laundry into the washing machine.Kiran inhaled deeply to enjoy the scent of her girlfriend&#039;s pee one last time before tossing the bundle in. She wondered what Jamie would have in store for her– she would certainly feel compelled to get payback after what had just happened. Her vagina tingled at the thought of being subjected to all of Jamie&#039;s sexual demands. She hoped…</p>

        <p class="card-text">My name is Jenny. I&#039;m a nurse and I was on a bus from Montana to Seattle. I would have driven but had some car problems. In Spokane a cute blond gets on, sits across from me and promptly falls asleep. A few hours later after a rest stop I noticed the blond is still sleeping. In a half–hour she wakes up and we start talking. Her name is Lori and she is very easy to talk to, and we were having a good time until I see her start to squirm. Lori admits she really needs to pee and gets up to ask the driver to stop, then comes back with a very worried look on her face.
We talk some more, but Lori is getting frantic, and starts to bounce in her seat. And I am getting very turned on. Finally she reaches her limit, &quot;Oh…</p>

Tanja and I were together in Mexico. It still seemed so surreal even as I lay beside her in bed that first morning in a five star beachside resort. It was already getting quite warm even though it couldn&#039;t have been past 9:30. I considered getting up to turn on the AC before it got too hot, but didn&#039;t want to leave the comfortable bed just yet. Tanja was still sleeping beside me, completely nude. 
It had been a long but fun night. We had gotten drunk back in L.A., but not drunk enough to be restricted from flying. We had taken a cab to the airport, already desperate from the alcohol we had consumed. We…</p>

The first seven weeks of my new job flew by. I was really busy with work, learning many of my tasks on the fly. I was glad that I had paid attention in school; I knew the basics of my job very well. However, there were still many aspects of my job that had been taught lightly or not at all. I worked hard to learn the ropes of the trade and complete my tasks as quickly and effectively as I could. My boss, Mr. Brokovich had been pleased with how well I was picking up things, but it was really all Tanja&#039;s doing. She was a great mentor, both in accounting–related matters and in love.

When I was in my late teens, my local park had a boating lake, and Bill, the boatman used to let some of us help him and in return we would get free trips out on the rowing boats. There were several of us– including girl called Tracey, who was about 3 years younger than I. I found her quite attractive and often took the opportunity to share a rowing boat with her. 
One day we rowed into the centre of the lake and drew in the oars, allowing the boat to just drift. We chatted for a while, and soon found ourselves looking into each other&#039;s eyes. We kissed, gently at first but soon quite passionately. Tracey&#039;s hand strayed to my leg, just above…</p>

        <p class="card-text">My partner and I were invited to an Old Skool rave at a friend&#039;s house last weekend. She had not initially understood the invite fully. It was obvious to me but although Val&#039;s English is excellent, it is not her first language and there are subtle cultural differences, which had eluded her. I realised that it was going to be predominantly 90&#039;s music but it was also going to be fancy dress. We were expected to go in school uniform or at least something that would pass as that.
Val was quite surprised. She has never really got her head round this schoolgirl nightclub thing. She feels that there is something odd about young women dressing as provocative schoolgirls, especially as she says the English are so…</p>

She was a girl with long, brown hair, blue eyes, peach skin, and a beautiful, curvy body. As well as a little fetish that she shared with her men.
Lying and squirming on a sturdy mattress, the girl trembled as the spasms of pee pushed her bladder to near bursting point. Keeping her long legs wide open for her partner, she bit down on her lip as the fight to contain her pee became more and more difficult. She had her hands tied down, but she was not planning to use them of her own accord either way. Her legs were not tied, but she chose to spread them for her lover.
Her lover was a muscular man with a rugged face, short,…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Things have taken an unlikely turn at my workplace. I feel very fortunate to have met Tanja, but sometimes wish that it had happened outside the workplace. I doubt I would have been as fortunate with her at a bar or a club. It was something that was destined to happen exactly the way it did. Tanja and I hadn&#039;t even gone out together outside of work or even talked on the phone. I didn&#039;t know anything about her life outside of what I had seen at work. I didn&#039;t know if she had a boyfriend or even girlfriends other than Selena. I wanted to know more about Tanja and considered asking her about her life, but was afraid to come across as interrogating. Tanja was a free–spirited woman, willing to take life by the…</p>

Alan lived opposite a park with a clear view of the bus stop that was outside the entrance. He often used to sit and watch people coming and going through the park, and people waiting for the bus. 
Late one evening he was looking out of his window and he saw a couple of young ladies coming out of the park. They looked to be in their late teens or early twenties, and Alan thought they looked quite attractive. One was brown skinned with black hair, and the other was white skinned with ginger hair. Both were…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Daniela was a model for a car club in her state. Today she was leaving a photo shoot dressed in tight black short shorts, pink pantyhose, a pink tube top, and pink heels. During the shoot she had drank plenty of water due to how hot it was out, and by the time they were wrapping she felt the first few twinges telling her she needed to find a bathroom. 
Driving towards home she remembers that she needs to stop by Walmart to pick up a few things, all the while sipping on a large 2–liter bottle of water. By the time she pulls into the parking lot her bladder is under siege by all the water she drank, and she knows she needs to find a bathroom, but she thinks she can hold it until she gets home, so she grabs a…</p>

God, it was hot! In fact, it was one of the hottest days I can ever remember, at least in the UK. It was so hot, you didn&#039;t want to do anything; even breathing was an effort. My friend Claire and I were sprawled on a park bench, shaded from the direct sunlight by a large tree. Neither of us had any energy at all – we&#039;d just used up what little we had drinking cold lagers in a nearby pub! 
&#039;Oh, Christ, Jen! This heat really is just too much,&#039; Claire wailed, &#039;I&#039;m absolutely busting for a piss, but I can&#039;t be bothered to move!&#039;
She could almost have been reading my mind. My own bladder was…</p>

        <p class="card-text">I am writing about my experiences with a very special woman that I felt very fortunate to meet even if it was for a limited time. It all started with my new job at an advisory and management accounting firm in Los Angeles. I had just graduated from university at the age of 23 and was a little inexperienced in the relationship department. I had never had a girlfriend or even a high school sweetheart. All my sexual experiences had come from binge–drinking campus parties and one–night stands. Admittedly, I was glad to get out of the college life and into the real world, where was I hoping to find a more meaningful relationship that I had not found up to this point.
I had graduated with good grades from a…</p>
