        <p class="card-text">Zane Carson woke up feeling great! It was Saturday morning and he would be working on his house today. He needed to work in the attic and knew it would be best done early, before the Southern California sun turned the attic into an oven. Zane rolled out of bed, dressed and set up his ladder under the attic access door. He worked quickly, tossing all his materials, tools and water jug up into the opening. Ignoring the twinge in his bladder, Zane climbed the ladder and entered the attic. He was glad to see the generous vents at each end of his attic, which would help keep air moving. Zane had just settled in a Los Angeles suburb where he had obtained a good job in information technology. The active and fit 45…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Lucy hobbled hurriedly up to the ladies loo with her hand clasped firmly between her legs. &quot;Please Miss Susan,&quot; she pleaded. &quot;I really need to go to the little girls&#039; room.&quot; Susan was in the middle of smoothing a &quot;Toilet Closed&quot; sign onto the toilet door. She had made this, her third desperation party, a fancy dress school disco themed party and it was so good to see everyone really getting into the spirit of it. Lucy was wearing a short blue pleated skirt, which was now bunched firmly between her legs, and her blonde pigtails and pained expression really completed the effect.
&quot;Is it urgent?&quot; asked Susan.
&quot;Yes miss, ooh it&#039;s an emergency!&quot;

        <p class="card-text">The two girls were just hanging around outside the town&#039;s center, the burger stand. They were almost identically dressed, in tight designer jeans and white tops showing their bellies, one slightly rounder, and the other slightly shorter. Both had brown hair to their shoulders and were looking around to see where the action was. Being a local lad and an experienced hanger–around I immediately drifted over to see if I could be of service.
— Hi there, the tallest said. –Anything happen around here?
— This is it, I said. –First time here, right?
The shorter girl nodded. –We&#039;re staying at the hostel with our class, but got sort of tired of card games and giggling boys.

The card, off white with a pink and blue speckled background with specks of silver glitter attached, simply read &quot;Happy Birthday&quot; with a big blue number &quot;18&quot; embossed in the lower right. Firework–like designs surrounded the big &quot;18&quot; emblem. She opened the card and quickly scanned the message, looking for a check she thought might be in there. &quot;Happy 18th, honey. To a wonderful daughter on her special day! Love, Mom.&quot; Scribbled in black, from Mom&#039;s treasured 1940&#039;s fountain pen her grandmother had passed down to her.

Mr. Thwaite&#039;s rich uncle, the Duke of Westwick, was holding the stately party. The Duke, a small penguin suited man, was seated at the head of the grand table where the guests were about to eat. He smiled at Mr. Thwaite knowingly. Mr. Thwaite and his uncle were like father and son, so his crush on Miss Cunningham was well known by the Duke.

        <p class="card-text">It was just my luck that the night before we where to do the shopping for our house party, there was the biggest snowfall for years. Then to make matters worse, the strong winds had caused the snow to drift. Although the snow ploughs had made the main roads passable, the remainder of the thoroughfares were blocked to cars, even off–road vehicles. Ian, my husband, had dug paths along with the neighbors, so people could walk. But the nearest town was 6 miles away.
After a lot of thought we decided on a plan of action, the nearest main road was one and a half miles across the fields. We decided to make a fun thing out of it and walk to the main road, then phone for a taxi.
Then all dressed up in sweaters, wind…</p>

I went to the mailbox at my apartment complex, when I saw the prettiest girl walking along to the entrance door of my building. She was wearing a denim mini and a cute pink short sleeved shirt, so right away my mind began dancing with the idea of how lovely it would be to have a little of my kind of fun with her. As I thought of this, standing there at the mailbox, I let just a tiny dribble go in my pink boy cut panties, making sure none showed through my jeans.
I headed back to the apartment, and who was standing at the door to my neighbors but the pretty girl. She was kind of dancing about strangely …</p>

It was a hot summer day, near the end of July and all of Tyler&#039;s buds had deserted him for their summer jobs. Bored and full of pent–up desires (solitary masturbation just isn&#039;t enough), Tyler donned a hot pair of swim trunks under his clothes, and headed over to the local pool. He was keen on all those dripping, scantily clothed females. Oh, how he envied the male lifeguards that worked there.
He scanned the edge of the pool, looking for a friendly face. Seeing no one he recognized, he then turned his focus to the vacant poolside lounge chairs. He finally spotted an empty…</p>

Still two hundred miles from home, she decided to rest rather than to risk an accident. She smiled to herself at the word accident; there were several kinds, not all of them unpleasant.
She parked, grabbed her bags and went to check in. Her tight jeans left little room for her full bladder, so she unbuttoned her top button to ease the pressure. Being this obvious was part of the thrill. She put her bags down at the counter and smiled at the receptionist, a young fair girl in beige pants and a white blouse.
— Do you have a room for me?
— Sure.…</p>

Her breasts flirted with the thin silky material of her blouse, tight against her nipples. She had no need of a bra and she liked the looks she got without one.

Her panties played peek–a–boo with her as she turned in the mirror, her perfect ass occasionally visible under the dress as she moved. Pretty short! She decided it was just right.

        <p class="card-text">Unabsorbed, Michael gazed at the TV, vaguely following the carnival bright colors of the game but oblivious to the score. Which teams were playing? He was bored.
It was Saturday and rain brushed at the window.
A murmur of voices from the street idled through the glass, diffuse in the traffic noise. They drew his attention more than the TV and gradually his focus shifted to them, striving to separate male from female, even to catch an essence of what they said. This was not idle neighbor gossip, no. There was earnestness about the voices– instructing, planning, and plotting even.
Salesmen!
His attention complete, Michael positioned himself so he could observe a small group of individuals standing huddled…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Prince Kadrid stood at the silk–draped doorway to his royal harem, smiling at the sight of almost two dozen women from around the world, dressed in sheer dresses and skirts, lounging in the gorgeous rooms in the tropical sunlight. Holding back the silks, he entered, pulling behind him the new visitor to the palace, Darren, a tall, muscular man with a dark tan and short hair. Darren was a distinguished quest, and therefore was to have a pair of women for the night. Darren gaped at all of the women, and slowly walked around the rooms to find the ones he liked best. Finally, Darren pointed at two slender, tall women who were among a group talking softly together on the patio, sipping at tall pink lemonades. Cara…</p>

I&#039;m a truck driver.
That doesn&#039;t mean I&#039;m fat and sloppy – the girls say I look OK at thirty–one, and I have had my share of relationships. But spending most of my life in transit makes for a lousy home life, so I&#039;m single.
I was on an overnight ferry to the continent, going to Hamburg with a load of machinery. I don&#039;t drink much on these trips, but that doesn&#039;t keep me from spending the night in pubs or the discotheque.
She was sitting by herself. I had seen her with two friends, but they were flirting energetically with a bunch of economists from Croydon (they were very loud) and this girl was not included. I didn&#039;t exactly…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Karen rose early from her sleep, feeling the need to urinate. She loved this feeling, being on the edge of desperation, and considered going back to sleep. &#039;No,&#039; she decided, she better get up, because she wasn&#039;t sure she could hold it until morning, and her boyfriend was over. Even though he knew of her fetish, they had never really practiced it together before, because she was shy. Karen tried to sit up and realized her ankles were chained to the bed. She rolled over and nuzzled her boyfriend, but Josh was already awake. She could feel him watching her in the dark. &quot;Honey, where&#039;s the key?&quot; but he just chuckled and asked why. Karen told him, but he refused. &quot;I&#039;m going to make your deepest fantasy come true,…</p>

        <p class="card-text">The automatic door of the van hissed with air escaping loudly from the hydraulics, and creaked on old bearings as it slowly opened. The cool night air rushed in to greet the passengers as they stepped out of the vehicle in front of the hotel. Grasping the chrome handrail, they each stepped onto the black stair platform and then onto the asphalt parking lot. The high–rise building was new, the crowning jewel of the airport hotels, rising 15 stories into the clear night sky, suites along the very top floors and well appointed rooms below. Twin miniature man–made lakes were in front, framed by the granite entrance, a pair of palms framing the lakes. The blurred words &quot;HOTEL SHUTTLE&quot; were visible, reflecting in…</p>
