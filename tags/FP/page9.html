        <p class="card-text">But you Enjoy Suffering, don&#039;t you? (2)
Part Two
This picks up where Part One left off, obviously. So if you haven&#039;t read that, scroll down and catch up on your reading. This part will make a teeny bit more sense, maybe not much, but some. This portion here contains a little bit of, shall we say, consensual roughness between the two imaginary lovers. If you&#039;re uncomfortable with that, move on. Or even if you don&#039;t think you like it, try reading it. Gosh, you know sometimes we&#039;re surprised at what we find out about ourselves.
***
&quot;I&#039;m totally serious. No more until we get home,&quot; I said. But looking down at your skirt, already soaked in various places, I knew I&#039;d never be able to tell if you were behaving.

        <p class="card-text">At the time it seemed the logical thing to do – but trying to persuade my wife was another matter!
We had been at the beach for a few hours already and after a couple of bottles of cool water, we both needed to pee badly. Trouble is, my wife isn&#039;t one for peeing in public – even in the sea – so she sat there fidgeting while we discussed what to do. There were basically three options. One – she could go into the sea and pee while pretending to swim or paddle or whatever it is people do when they pee in the sea. Two – we could leave the beach, return to the car and find a rest area nearby that had toilet facilities. Or three – she could pee where she was, sitting next to me, onto the towel that was still damp…</p>

        <p class="card-text">This fantasy was inspired by the recent postings on Wink 11.
It was a chilly autumn Saturday. Football season had ended two weeks ago, and the students from State U didn&#039;t have much to do. A gang of four senior girls decided to liven things up by having a beer–drinking contest.
Susan, a local, was what might be called the leader of their clique. Her companions were from different parts of the state. All were interested primarily in boys except for Sally, who secretly preferred girls. Sally and Gabriella were brunettes; Susan, a blonde and Theresa had auburn hair. They had the typical, budding physiques of young womanhood, average height and weight. Boys found them sexy in their tight jeans.
They lived in an…</p>

        <p class="card-text">This story is fictional.
The doorbell rang and I knew it was the UPS delivery I had been expecting. I opened the door and was greeted by a rather pleasant looking female delivery driver. She smiled at me in a slightly nervous sort of way and let out a bit of a groan as she set down the rather large box of parts I had ordered for my Alfa Romeo Spider. She straightened up and still seemed a bit fidgety, as she held out her electronic clipboard for my signature.
At this point, I took a better look at her. She was about 5&#039;7&quot;, with long dark hair and sunglasses on. Being the better part of August, it was already at least 80–degrees outside and she was wearing her &#039;standard issue&#039; brown short sleeve shirt and…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Officer Jim Collins has been on traffic patrol for 7 years now and is pretty sure he has seen it all...except what he wants to see. He has heard the other traffic officers discuss seeing it from time to time, and has tried to get details without being &quot;too&quot; interested. His former patrol partner had pulled over a lady just last month for weaving in traffic. She had been about 28, pretty, and very drunk. She had gotten out of her car and flooded her panties while trying to walk a straight line. Jim had seen her at the station, but he could see nothing of her wetness; her dress had remained dry and he didn&#039;t think it would be wise to request a peek.

She shifted around in her tight shorts, trying to relieve the pressures of her screaming bladder. Her nipples poked out against her hot pink tank top.

Jenny&#039;s first thought when she awoke was, I have to pee. The second was, &#039;Please don&#039;t stop fondling my pussy.&#039;
The significance of that second thought took some time to sink in. She was lying on her stomach with one leg drawn up, and a probing hand was stroking her from behind, parting her butt cheeks, sliding all the way up and down, catching her moisture, slipping inside her openings. But as she felt herself rise to orgasm she remembered. A small spurt of pee escaped her as she climaxed. She lay for a moment, just breathing. Then she felt arms embrace her and the pressure of breasts on her back. Slowly she turned and met Becky…</p>

I knew there would definitely be some wetness that day because the traffic report warned of delays due to road construction on the highway. Before heading out we filled a cooler with bottles of water, cans of coke, and a few bottles of juice and iced tea since it was a rather hot day. Eric and myself are both freaks about staying hydrated and even if we have to go on a long road trip we don&#039;t hold off on the fluids. It&#039;s simply uncomfortable to be thirsty, and if it&#039;s only the two of us on the trip a little moisture never hurt anyone …</p>

        <p class="card-text">Barbara awoke slightly aware that something was wrong– her eyes flicked open, and she was not sitting in a country gateway with her panties round her ankles. She was in bed, with alarm bells sounding in her mind. Her hand went down to her panty crotch to confirm what her waking mind already knew. She had wet the bed!
She had been dreaming that she had been out walking her new baby son Mark around the countryside in his pushchair. She had somehow gotten lost, and was unsure about which way to go to find the quickest way home. Above all she really needed to wee but was unsure of the length of time it would be till she could make it all the way home.
Her need had suddenly become urgent and with her pelvic…</p>

        <p class="card-text">It was the annual festival, with music and fairgrounds and beer tents and the usually inadequate toilet facilities. Becky knew she had waited too long.
After a couple of beers she had felt the need to go, but deep in conversation she had put it off. As she finally headed for the porta loos she realized the queues had grown in proportion with her need. Sighing, she took her place at the end of the line.
Becky was a short girl of twenty–nine, dressed in very tight white pants and a blue tee shirt. Her body was round in the hips, but she had a narrow waist, although her belly echoed the roundness of her bottom. With short brown hair and a nice smile she usually made friends fast. She put her weight on her other…</p>

I&#039;m twirling around, somewhat slowly, finishing a decidedly amateur version of a camel back spin, the announcer blaring that &quot;open ice is over&quot;. The other skaters begin to clear the ice, the overprotective mothers hovering over their next superstar wunderkind child, the harried parents yelling at their hopefully NHL destined little boy, the romantic couples skating a few extra laps lazily around the rink, arm in arm, seemingly oblivious to the announcers call. The dusk sky slowly rolls in, yet it&#039;s still somewhat warm out. The rink, a public outdoors facility, shuts down early on Fridays for maintenance. I&#039;m still amazed they kept it running today. While the ice was a little slippery,…</p>

The strong smell of chlorine fills the air. The concrete walls echo with the screaming of children, teens and nervous parents. It&#039;s two o&#039;clock and my shift is over. I survey the scene on this busy Saturday; take the empty water bottle with me as my replacement shows up. As I climb down the ladder from the watch chair I&#039;m aware how badly I need to use the bathroom. No breaks today, another lifeguard called in sick, and it&#039;s been four hours without a pee break, and with as much water as I had, I&#039;m about to burst. My red lifeguard bathing suit fits tightly over my 5&#039; 6&quot; body, my long dark hair tied up in a bun. I fidget as I sign out, the tight fabric of my bathing suit clinging to my…</p>

Anyway, this one girl was consuming a copious amount of alcohol and we all know what that does to people. It lowers your inhibitions and makes you have to pee every 10 minutes.
Meg, the girl in question was always a bit of an exhibitionist and quite open about her body. We were all gathered around the fire and she kept saying &quot;man I really have to pee.&quot; After about the 4th time she said this she said &quot;Fuck it, I am just gonna go right here&quot; so she stepped back about 3 feet from the fire, turned her back towards us and let rip one of the most powerful streams I have ever…</p>
