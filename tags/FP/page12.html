        <p class="card-text">Morning light streams in the windows as she stands poised at the kitchen island counter, her mind wandering to thoughtless oblivion as she watches him stroll to the car, sipping on her second cup of coffee. The mere sight of him stirs a longing into her being. Her head drops to her chest and the fragrance of his cologne on his shirt that she wears assaults her nostrils. Her eyes close and the image of him unfurls, causing her to steady herself with her arms outstretched on the counter. The thoughts of him are so clear that she never hears him re–enter the kitchen.
Silently, he stands against the door jam with his coat slung over his shoulder admiring her as she stood slightly leaned forward across the granite…</p>

        <p class="card-text">While out to a little piano bar the other night, I ran into the ex–wife of a former neighbor. I used to go over and play cards or just hang out at their place.
When she noticed me, she came over and gave me a big hug, and we started talking about old times. I hadn&#039;t seen her in about 15 years; she is now a very striking lady of 45.
Way back when, she used to catch me looking at her gorgeous body, and I caught her once or twice looking at the front of my jeans, and she got a rise out of me at least once. But it never went beyond looking. After talking for about an hour, she left no doubt in my mind she wanted to have sex. She told me how many times she had fantasized that it was I instead of her husband she…</p>

        <p class="card-text">&quot;How would you like to make some easy money?&quot; Jo asked Jaynee as she got back from the ladies&#039; room at The Oak one night. They would do this about once a month. Leave their troubles behind and sing karaoke. It was good for the soul although neither could afford it as often as necessary. Jo had just brought back another round of drinks from the bar and was waiting for her friend to return.
&quot;Do tell!&quot; An excited response; this was good for Jo, because the question she was about to ask was a touchy one. It had taken 3 hard lemonades to get up the nerve to get even this far.
Jaynee and Jo had been friends all through their school days and shared their innermost secrets with each other. So when Stan, Jo&#039;s husband…</p>

Today we plan to go to the coast to stay in my mobile home, at Breckelsham Bay. You are wearing a green woolen sweater with a vee neck, which shows just a swelling of pink ample breasts, a blue pleated skirt, (which is quite short) over blue schoolgirl panties, with white ankle socks and white trainers. You look very attractive with your hair swept back. The car is comfortable and warm, and the weather sunny. After a time, we stop and have a drink at a pub. We are aware that it&#039;s holiday time so that we are relaxed and you drink two pints of lager. You don&#039;t have time to go to the toilet before we go, but…</p>

All her training was useless in a situation like this, and she knew she was but seconds away from ruining her entire career.
The evening had started out innocently enough; in fact she had been looking forward to it. She had been commissioned by Gaijin Inc. to provide hospitality to this uncouth Westerner for the evening and had all manner of tricks of the trade planned to excite his foreign…</p>

Good since he wasn&#039;t such a geek anymore, bad because he found it difficult to adapt to the new world around him.

On the designated evening many colleagues arrived at the main office building, where we were led to the biggest conference room, which had been transformed to a concert hall with a proper stage for the occasion. Everyone looked at his or her best: the men in suits, the women wearing dresses or skirts, mostly short ones.

I told them that I was prepared to be a sort of referee; however there were to be some ground rules. I wanted to be a witness to all challenges, or else I couldn&#039;t be fair. Secondly I wanted to stay friends with all of them so I said that I was going to be fair, and that they shouldn&#039;t get mad at me for making judgments.

        <p class="card-text">So, I left you with my last experience with Casey. We had finally got a couple of things out in the open. She knew how turned on I was at the sight of her desperation. I knew how much she wanted to see me in a similar situation. 
A week or so after my experience with her she was hanging out at my apartment when somehow the topic came up. Casey expressed the interest of getting me into a situation where she could get me desperate to go. She said the ultimate goal was to see me soak myself. I was a bit turned on by the idea. I have previously written about a situation I had with a good friend of mine, Brooke, last Christmas when we had both wet ourselves. That turned into a pretty orgasmic situation.

        <p class="card-text">I opened the car door, grabbed her by the hand, and pulled her roughly out of the car. &quot;Look at you, you slut!&quot; I yanked down the top of her knit dress exposing her titties. She was bent forward pressing her hands against her pussy. &quot;Lean on the car,&quot; I said, twisting her to face the car. She was squirming and wiggling. &quot;I can&#039;t believe you just peed in my car,&quot; I said. I tugged her tiny dress up exposing her panties. I could see her crotch was moist and still dripping. &quot;Goddamn it, I can&#039;t believe you just pissed in my car. And look at you, wet panties and all.&quot; Her back was arched, her butt sticking out, grinding in mid–air. &quot;I couldn&#039;t help it,&quot; she said whining, &quot;I have to pee so bad it hurts!&quot; &quot;Hold still…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Ashley wasn&#039;t the most popular girl, or the best looking. However, Kevin didn&#039;t care. He liked her for her personality. 
On the day school was out, Ashley was very busy, She would go to school, do everything there, then she would come home and immediately go to the orthodontist. Then it was off to physical therapy, because she broke her arm a while back. Then she was going to Kevin&#039;s for dinner, and then off to the movies. 
At the end of the school day, her bladder was already feeling it. Through the orthodontist appt., she was squirming the whole time. By the time it was dinner, she couldn&#039;t imagine making it till about 10:30, the end of the movie.
The two went to the theater, and Ashley had the hottest…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Elizabeth Jones closed the door behind her and put the briefcase on the desk. Interesting stuff, this seminar, but enough was enough. Time to get out of business clothes and ponder the possibilities. She removed her dark blue jacket and skirt, unbuttoned her blouse, and enjoyed moving about wearing tights, panties and bra. For some reason hotel rooms made her feel erotic. Could be the undressing in strange quarters, knowing there were people behind the walls; maybe the dominating, inviting double bed; maybe the chance to meet someone in the bar or restaurant. She touched the nylon roundness of her belly, conscious of a need to relieve herself. She smiled, recalling stories of peeing in hotel beds. She had done…</p>

        <p class="card-text">I started studying with Miss Anderson at fourteen. I had played for as long as I can remember, and was ready to go on to more difficult pieces – thence the private lessons. Miss Anderson was around thirty and usually dressed in proper skirt and blouse, with her auburn hair tied into a bun. Still, she was the object of my fantasies, being a woman who took me seriously, as opposed to the girls of my own age, who were either plain and giggly or pretty and condescending. She was petite, about my height at that time, and the decent clothes did not hide her womanly shape. I kept my dreams a secret for four years. After returning that autumn from three months&#039; break, I found myself a couple of inches taller, with…</p>

        <p class="card-text">She bumped into me at the bar. Five–five, blonde hair in two short pigtails, cheeky smile, and dressed in black low–cut pants and top showing three inches of bare belly. She said hi and smiled expectantly at me. Who am I to turn someone down? –Like a drink, I said. She nodded, pigtails waving. –Beer is fine. While waiting we introduced ourselves. Her name was Carrie. I resisted suggesting carrying her home, as she seemed to have gotten the same idea. The crowd was pushing, and she swayed on her feet, pushing a breast against my arm or a hip against my thigh. I admit to feeling something rise down there. –You here alone, she asked, very close to my ear. –Not really. –Oh. Well, I don&#039;t have company. She brushed…</p>
