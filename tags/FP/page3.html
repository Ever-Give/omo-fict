        <p class="card-text">About a week ago, my girlfriend Jenny and I decided to go to a small–town outdoor country music festival. The way it was advertised was that music would be going all day and well into the night, with vendors selling food, arts &amp; crafts, and the like. Jenny and I are both into country music, and are kind of the outdoorsy types.
I fell in love with this girl a couple years ago when we were seniors in high school. We had flirted around for a couple of months when a mutual friend finally hooked us up. I couldn&#039;t believe my luck that this slender, athletic blonde country girl wanted to hook up with me.
It only took us a few months to get intimate– at our senior prom, no less, and we soon found out how sexually…</p>

Allie stood in her room; blushing so hard you could see it through her brown hair that cluttered her face. Kelli walked away, making sure the dark blue panties were a little bit up her ass for her sister to see, as she walked into her room. Allie stood there, knowing that Kelli had something planned from the glimmer in her eye. She cautiously walked over to her sister&#039;s door, which was open, but was dark inside. She stood there, looking in the room for Kelli, but couldn&#039;t find her. She…</p>

It had started out like any other ordinary day. She was sat in a classroom in college and the afternoon was dragging. It wasn&#039;t the lesson, that was interesting enough, but she had plans for that night and was eager to get home. It was strange how time always seemed to slow down on those occasions when you actually want it to speed up!

Sex was great but we had no real connection. My girlfriend Courtney took it much harder than I did. She called me about a dozen times a day to make sure I was all right. I was!
About a week after the break–up she called and insisted that we have &quot;girl&#039;s night.&quot; I did not need one, but it seemed fun anyway.
She took me to the liquor store and insisted that we buy the best. She had more money than I so I let her pick the drinks. She worked for a law firm. Although she was only a secretary she seemed to run the place. Anyway, money was no problem for her.…</p>

Mel is the type of girl that has &quot;the eyes.&quot; &quot;The eyes&quot; are the type of eyes that can give a super sexy look and get anyone to do anything. She fidgeted with her panties for a moment as they were riding into her crotch cause she liked to wear tight satin panties. These ones were blue with flower prints on them under her baby pink mini skirt. She made sure her tits looked nice and perky in her matching pink halter–top and knocked on the door.

I have been living in Portland, Oregon for some time now and I like to go out and have a drink at a bar called Thatcher&#039;s. I have never known where the restroom is and as I particularly don&#039;t like to use the toilet anyway I have never asked.
Well one day I left home and caught a bus. I stood out at that bus stop for what seemed forever when I began to realize I needed to go pee. I was meeting someone at Thatcher&#039;s and didn&#039;t want to be late so I decided to wait until I got to the bar and hopefully would find a quiet corner to pee in.

She sat there on the couch bored, watching TV and sipping at her Coke. She was quite a naughty and promiscuous girl, and got anyone she wanted when she wanted them...it wasn&#039;t too hard for her; all she had to do was throw her long, brunette hair over her shoulder and smile her shiny lips at somebody, show off her perfect white teeth with the glitter in her brown eyes and she had them.

        <p class="card-text">Once upon a time there was a princess named Ella who had just turned 18. She was allowed to move out at age 18 so she found a nice castle thousands of miles away from the King and Queen and decided to move there. After getting settled into the castle, Ella realized that she would need some servants. She had also always wanted some personal companions who would keep her company and who would be her friends if she so wanted them to. So she looked through the phone book to find what she was looking for. She came upon a rather odd listing. There was a picture of four women in their 20&#039;s who were offering to come live with someone and attend to their every need, including just being a companion or best friend if so…</p>

&quot;Who&#039;s having the party?&quot; He asks.
&quot;Oh Trev, apparently it&#039;s HUGE, everyone will be there!&quot; Nick rolls his eyes, and smiles.
&quot;Alrighty, what time?&quot;
&quot;Well, we could go early I thought, We could have a few drinks here before we go too, I wanted to drink that Chambord, I would take it but I don&#039;t want those assholes to get their hands on it, so we&#039;ll start drinking here, and…</p>

Lisa looked up at Christy confused and Christy smirked at her, saying, &quot;If you&#039;re going to be wetting your pants like a baby, then we need to treat you like one! I want you to go to the store and buy some diapers and a pacifier. Also buy a pair of handcuffs.&quot;
Lisa threw her arms in the air and looked down at her soaking wet jeans. Christy smiled and said, &quot;You&#039;re going just like you are now.&quot; She looked up at the clock. &quot;Hurry, baby, I&#039;m timing you.&quot; Christy lay on the couch and turned on the television.

        <p class="card-text">I was driving home from the office. I was alone in the car, and suddenly the traffic slowed and came to an abrupt halt. For the next half hour we started, crawled, and stopped, covering about half a mile. Up ahead there was a bus stop and about twenty folk waiting. I glanced in the mirrors and could see no bus behind me. I felt sorry for them because I guessed they&#039;d got a fair wait ahead of them. As I looked at them I noticed one, a dark haired lady in her twenties jogging up and down. Suddenly her hand went between her legs and she bent forwards at the waist, bending her knees. Slowly she straightened up and seemed to regain control, but then she went into a pee dance, hopping rapidly from one foot to the…</p>

        <p class="card-text">A few months ago my friend Melinda had given me a cigarette lighter. When she gave it to me I didn&#039;t smoke, so I thought it was a little weird. I guess because it led me to my first cigarette, I was not complaining– just curious. Why would she give such an odd gift?
I got the answer today.
Yesterday, Melinda and I were at the picnic table at school. We were just talking and gossiping as usual. As she did everyday, she opened the secret pocket in her book bag and pulled out a cigarette. She walked down to the &quot;smokers ditch&quot; and puffed away. As always, I followed her. As usual I seemed out of place in the smokers ditch. All of the others were Punks and Heads, the few that were lucky to have somehow gotten…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Lisa woke up nervous today, because today wasn&#039;t just another day. First of all, let me tell you about Lisa. She&#039;s very pretty, long tanned legs, tight ass, 36C cup, and sexy brunette hair to match her cute brown eyes. She&#039;s also very bisexual; she may even prefer girls to guys. And for the past few months she&#039;s been toying over the Internet, getting interested in the idea of being dominant and having a submissive girl. And today was the day she was going to meet the girl she had been talking with for those few months. From the pictures she saw, Christy is a feisty redhead girl with shoulder length curly hair who is athletic and has perky tits.
Lisa stretched and enjoyed the sun sparkling over her nude body…</p>
