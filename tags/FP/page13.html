        <p class="card-text">The following accounts are true, only the names have been changed to protect the guilty.
Back in the early 1980&#039;s I became involved with a sexy blonde girl named Mindy who was a former stripper. At the time we were both in our mid 20&#039;s. She was a big girl, not fat by any means but what most would call statuesque. About 150 lbs, 5&#039; 11&quot;, large pendulous tits, a nice round ass, and legs a mile long which she loved to show off with short mini–skirts. She turned heads wherever we went, both male and female.
The sex was hot from the start, and within a few months we were living together. She was quite open–minded sexually and we experimented with just about everything including pee fun. While this did not turn her…</p>

        <p class="card-text">After the phone sex I had with Amanda, my college lecturer, we had both promised to refrain from any sexual indulgence until our arranged meeting the following afternoon. By that time we would both be feeling very horny, and we had also decided to resist relieving our bladders from lunch onwards. I was more than happy to agree, &quot;but don&#039;t forget,&quot; I had reminded her. &quot;You have us for P E at the last session – you don&#039;t want me to wet myself during that?&quot; &quot;No,&quot; she said, &quot;but it will be nicer if we are both having to hold on, so be a good girl until then, good bye.&quot; The phone went dead, leaving me sitting on the toilet tingling with anticipation, my hand still in my wet panties, it was all I could do to keep my…</p>

Both families having cabins by the small lake, we just had to be together. There were more young people around that we met, became friends, drifted apart. But Kate was something special. And that summer something changed. It was the annual midsummer feast, everybody gathering in the clearing by the bay, barbecuing, playing games, children dipping their toes. My family had arrived that afternoon, my little sister seeking her best friend, and I hoped Kate was there. She was. Brown hair parted in the middle, green eyes, her body a little rounder than last year.…</p>

        <p class="card-text">She had been watching me for some time. She sat alone by a column drinking beer, and caught my eyes a couple of times, lifting her glass to me. She was dressed in a short skirt and tight top, had dark, curly hair, and was not very tall. Her clothes accentuated her rounded body, and her skirt rode up to reveal the top of her stay–up pantyhose. A woman in her thirties on the lookout.I was sitting by the bar, ready to be selected. I lifted my glass and nodded to her. The music was loud. She put her hands to her red mouth and mouthed, &quot;dance?&quot; and I finished my beer and rose. She came into my arms, almost sliding into place, and I felt soft breasts brush my stomach and a deliberate pressure against my groin. My…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Getting into the car, Ian suggested that they call for some lunch and a drink at his club. Jill was a little concerned about going in with no panties on, a predicament arising from their exploits in the car park. She felt her skirt was damp at the back, but Ian reassured her that it did not show. Going in to the club, which was very elegant, they checked in, and then proceeded to their respective toilets to freshen up. In the luxurious ladies&#039; toilet Jill wiped her tummy and legs with a damp flannel, before applying perfume between her thighs, wishing she had retrieved some clean panties from her case. Then she repaired her make up and tidied up her hair. With one final look in the large mirror she felt…</p>

One day I went to a birthday party for a friend. We had plenty of beer and soft drinks and everyone was having a good time. Nothing unusual happened until the drinks started to catch up with me and I went to the bathroom to recycle some beer.The bathroom was upstairs and there didn&#039;t seem to be anyone else around so I went in but didn&#039;t bother to lock the door. I realized that I had to poop too so I sat down and started to pee. Suddenly the door opened and a girl came in. She wasn&#039;t my girl friend but we were good friends. She had her dress pulled way up and I could see her white cotton panties. Her hand was between her legs and she was rubbing her pussy.…</p>

The pleated mini skirt showed her legs to good advantage, together with the black sheer stockings held in place with a matching frilly suspender belt, black patent leather shoes.

In fact it was she who, in the earlier stages of their relationship, could be credited with his induction into the delights of wet love. The last time he had talked to her was only last night.
