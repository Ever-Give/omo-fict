He ignores it, noting the rush he gets as he grabs his stirring member to stem a stronger momentary urge. He pours a tall glass of water and gulps half of it at once while dancing in place. To the uninformed, his actions might appear at odds with sanity. He turns on the computer, checks email then browses through the special sites that interest him. The glass is empty now and he refills it. David downloads a couple of free utilities. He cannot get comfortable, dares not relax. Again the glass is empty. He knows he cannot refill it now without wetting himself. He tries to…</p>

        <p class="card-text">*** Why Is The Bed Wet?
I met this girl named Kate about a year ago. We were both 25 at the time and we have been dating since. Things were going well for us. But recently Kate began having this problem...
&quot;Kate, Why is the bed wet?&quot; I asked as I woke her up from a sleep.
&quot;WHAT?&quot; Kate yelled as she sat right up in bed. &quot;Oh my god! I ... I wet the bed!&quot; Kate was sitting in a large puddle in the bed. The sheets were wet enough that you could see liquid being squeezed out of the fabric as she moved. I woke because I felt the wetness seep over to my side of the bed and found my pajamas wet as well. Kate had a sheer panic look on her face and tears were forming in her eyes.
&quot;Shhh ... Kate it&#039;s ok, accidents…</p>

They both knew they turned heads as the guys looked at Amy&#039;s fine figure in her tight blue jeans and crop top with her brunette hair tied up in a bun and Jordan in her short miniskirt and tank top, her shiny red hair reaching down to her shoulder blades.
&quot;Ha, those guys always trip over their shoelaces every time we walk out of a room,&quot; Jordan said. &quot;How the hell are we single?&quot;

I was loading the washing machine after 90 minutes this evening, but I already had a cup of tea and a beer inside me when I started. Read on – you&#039;ll see what I&#039;m going on about!
Once again, this is pure fantasy, sadly there is no Sarah, and all events are fictitious.
After our experiences on the beach, I couldn&#039;t wait to find out what Sarah had in mind for a holding on contest. I had to wait until we got home, because she said what she had planned would be far too messy to contemplate in the B&amp;B we had been staying at in Cornwall.

        <p class="card-text">Cold Wet Weekend Part 1
Madeline was a sweet 19–year–old girl (In her mid 20&#039;s now) that used to live down the road from where I used to live. In fact, sometimes I dreamed about her. She was the nicest, not to mention the most beautiful girl in the neighborhood. She stood about 5&#039; 11&quot;, weighed about 120 pounds, long red curly hair, green eyes, bright red lips, and a dark complexion. She was pretty popular in those days, but she never went out much after she left high school. For some reason (which I do not know to this day) she didn&#039;t carry on any relationships past high school.
One hot summer evening, at an ice cream stand, we finally stood toe to toe for the first time since the 7th grade. She had claimed…</p>

I don&#039;t know what I had been dreaming about or what caused this amazing hard on but it sure felt wonderful. It was particularly nice this morning because I really had to pee badly– very badly. In fact, I couldn&#039;t tell if I was about to cum or pee. In either event I was going to leave my sleepy wife in bed and go get some relief in the bathroom.
In the same second as I was about to throw off the covers and roll out, She turned towards me, flopped her arm down on my stomach and laid her hand across my dick. It seems she was about to wake up too and suddenly realized how big and hard I was. I couldn&#039;t tell her about how much I had to pee…</p>

He needed to work in the attic and knew it would be best done early, before the Southern California sun turned the attic into an oven. Zane rolled out of bed, dressed and set up his ladder under the attic access door. He worked quickly, tossing all his materials, tools and water jug up into the opening. Ignoring the twinge in his bladder, Zane climbed the ladder and entered the attic. He was glad to see the generous vents at each end of his attic, which would help keep air moving.

        <p class="card-text">Mr. Thwaite smiled at Miss Cunningham as he pulled out a chair for the young lady to sit on. This was his lucky night: a decent opportunity to impress the delightful young lady to whom his affections belonged.
Mr. Thwaite&#039;s rich uncle, the Duke of Westwick, was holding the stately party. The Duke, a small penguin suited man, was seated at the head of the grand table where the guests were about to eat. He smiled at Mr. Thwaite knowingly. Mr. Thwaite and his uncle were like father and son, so his crush on Miss Cunningham was well known by the Duke.
&quot;Ahem,&quot; coughed the Duke whilst tapping his spoon lightly against his crystal glass. &quot;If I can have your attention please!&quot;

        <p class="card-text">Patty Richardson checked herself for the third time – ok, she had to admit that she really looked good. Her breasts flirted with the thin silky material of her blouse, tight against her nipples. She had no need of a bra and she liked the looks she got without one. Her long shapely legs looked even more remarkable under the tight mini. Her panties played peek–a–boo with her as she turned in the mirror, her perfect ass occasionally visible under the dress as she moved. Pretty short! She decided it was just right. The 28–year–old single mother worked long hours as a social worker and the mental anguish of the job often left her numb, but tonight was girls&#039; night out. She allowed herself this luxury about once a…</p>

&quot;What? Oh yeah, sorry. I must have fallen asleep,&quot; I say and automatically obey the flight attendant by releasing the seat forward. Immediately, my full bladder announces that it must be emptied.
I have been on this six–hour flight and have been assigned to the window seat, which was usually my favorite place to sit. But this time the man in the isle seat next to me has the longest legs I have ever seen. And no sooner had the flight begun, than he stretched them out in front of him and fell asleep, trapping me for the entire flight. I felt a little claustrophobic and had two beers to help relax. Between the alcohol and the motion of the plane, I…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Sorry it&#039;s taken me a while to have a story to share with you guys. I have been tied up in a serious relationship with my girlfriend Ashley and that hasn&#039;t really brought up any desperate situations. She is so hot and I love her to death. However, I have been wishing I could witness her in a desperate situation.
The last story I shared was about one of her friends who almost wet her pants on a way to a party. I was disappointed when she made it out dry. It&#039;s been a year or so since I have fooled around with Kendra in plotting &quot;accidents&quot;. I do keep in touch with her even though she too is dating someone right now.
But let me shift my attention to Ashley. Last week we had been shopping around at the mall all…</p>

He didn&#039;t care how cute the new paralegal was. He didn&#039;t care how sweetly she had asked him to help find the old files in the basement. He had to go. He had just gotten out of a very boring, three hour board meeting, where he had drank cup after cup of coffee to keep awake during the first hour. The rest of the meeting he spent trying to ignore his full bladder. Finally, the meeting had concluded, and he made a direct beeline towards the bathroom. But, on his way there, the new paralegal, Lisa, approached him and asked his help to find the files on the case she was researching. She was so cute in her short navy blue skirt and little matching high heels.…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Officer Jim Collins has been on traffic patrol for 7 years now and is pretty sure he has seen it all...except what he wants to see. He has heard the other traffic officers discuss seeing it from time to time, and has tried to get details without being &quot;too&quot; interested. His former patrol partner had pulled over a lady just last month for weaving in traffic. She had been about 28, pretty, and very drunk. She had gotten out of her car and flooded her panties while trying to walk a straight line. Jim had seen her at the station, but he could see nothing of her wetness; her dress had remained dry and he didn&#039;t think it would be wise to request a peek.
