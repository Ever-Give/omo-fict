        <p class="card-text">Last week I had to go to a Handy shop in a big shopping mall. My drill didn&#039;t work and i had called the shop owner if it is possible to get a new. When I arrived at the shop, it was terribly busy, so I decided to go for a little shopping tour and come back later. It was a very hot day so I went into a cafe and bought an ice cream and a coke and sat out on the balcony. Afterwards, I went into some clothing shops and bought a nice short top. Before I returned to the Handy shop I bought another bottle of coke and then I slowly walked back.
When I entered the shop, only two guys were inside looking at the shop windows. Behind the counter I saw a big very well built guy with dark brown hair and wonderful blue eyes…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Robert and I were married over a year ago now. I&#039;ve washed his socks, cooked his dinner, dusted the house– in fact I&#039;ve done all the things a housewife used to do in the &#039;good old days.&#039; Before you tell me I&#039;ve given up my feminist principles I should tell you that Robert has done the same for me. In that time we have never had an argument and I&#039;ve never been happier.
Throughout last summer we drifted around the canals of England, stopping for the night in shady corners, away from the towns and continued to play our games whenever the mood took us. That is to say several times per week. Once we were caught by a farmer in the corner of his field where we had lain down for cuddle and a piddle. We were both wet…</p>

When we are at home and May is going to be there alone in the evening I suggest that she locks the door after about 7 in the evening because we have had a spate of conmen trying gain entry. The summer had ended and it had turned cool with rain almost every day. I had to go to a meeting that finished after 9 and would not be back till after half past. In order to be linked we had a meal together as well as a large bottle of fizzy orange. My meeting would end with a cup of tea so she promised to have one at the same time. We would wait till I got back to let it out. 
Well, the meeting lasted a bit longer than expected, as did the tea drinking so both of us had an extra cup. On the…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Sue Frederick took a shallow breath and tried to maintain her composure. She had not accounted for the extra pressure on her bladder from the huge soft drink her employee had ordered for each of them at lunch. It had fallen in well with her plan so she had said nothing. Now she was beginning to wonder about her timing, to say nothing of her bladder capacity. Reminding herself of her goal, she gave herself a quick caress between her legs, then another because it felt sooo good the first time. Art would not know what hit him!
At 135 pounds on a five foot three inch frame, the dark haired accounting supervisor could have been a bit chubby, but Sue had been blessed with a firm, ample bust topped by richly dark…</p>

Its 3 o&#039;clock in the morning and I&#039;ve just been for a wee. As I creep back into bed, May mumbles in her sleep rolling over to deny me even the three inches of mattress she usually allows me. Carefully I clamber over her to take her side of the bunk. The duvet doesn&#039;t stretch to my new side because May has it all. Is it like this for everyone who sleeps with someone else?
She looks so sweet curled up comfortably that I haven&#039;t the heart to yank the cover over to me. My ploy is to slide very close to her and put my arms around her. When she&#039;s asleep all her actions are reflex. She mumbles again and returns…</p>

Uxbridge is some way from the center of London but it&#039;s on an underground line. When we stopped the boat there, it was convenient to have a day out in the big city. My &#039;social education&#039; started when Robert began to show me how I could dress to make better use of what he calls &quot;my graces.&quot; Then he forced me to meet all sorts of people who cruise around the canals. One of these was a professor in a London University college. We had decided to go to see him and his wife at their home in Muswell Hill.
As they are an eccentric couple, Robert suggested that dressing too elaborately might be unwise since you never knew what they would have arranged for…</p>

The wetness, the excitement, and then the lounge door swung open and Hannah let out a great gush into her knickers in surprise.
&quot;Kirsty you startled me,&quot; she complained to her grinning flat mate. Kirsty always liked to see her friend pleasure herself in front of some dirty watersports video.

First drink, we always prefer water, 2 pints, and 1200ml each in less than an hour. Next, go for a brisk walk to get the system working. Two hours after the first cup we are back and holding but not desperate.

Many pleasures fade with repetition and we soon found that the things we enjoyed on our own no longer held the same satisfaction when we were together. Sitting at the computer with tight wet jeans or a nappy for example led on to masturbation when alone but together we just felt a trifle silly. Now neither of us continues with it.
Bedwetting was at first a great turn on but eventually it became a nuisance so we stopped that. A friendly human body becomes quite warm and damp enough when cuddled without the need to do excess washing each…</p>

The weather turned cool so we remained inside chatting and the conversation got round to wet matters because they asked about the line of damp clothing hanging by the fire. Our regular hold–it had degenerated into a mass spraying just as we settled down to the evening meal.

        <p class="card-text">This is the story of Reginald. A tall, handsome, huskily built but elegant gentleman aged about 40. His little episode took place one evening at Bish Manor, England, ca. 1935.
He had been with a wedding party all day, most of which took place out of doors at a vast estate in the English countryside. Once evening came, the party moved to an enormous house, practically labyrinthine, five stories or more, the rooms and passageways innumerable, and as Reginald was soon to discover, nearly impossible to navigate if unfamiliar.
He had been out of doors and in the company of others for the entire day, (as this particular wedding party was very large, over two hundred people, most of them high aristocracy, and…</p>

        <p class="card-text">So let&#039;s continue our adventure at the football game. We had a good time while at the game. You can&#039;t buy beer at the college games, of course, so we quenched our thirst with cokes and water.
During halftime we all took a trip to the bathroom. While on our way Kendra grabbed my arm and whispered in my ear, &quot;Mikey... how good was that earlier? I know I didn&#039;t wet myself like I promised but it felt so good trying to hold it. I just couldn&#039;t wet myself in front of all those people. Sorry, I hope you aren&#039;t disappointed...&quot;
&quot;Hey Kendra, that was pretty hot that all three of you had to go, especially Stacia. I really thought she wouldn&#039;t make it,&quot; I replied.
&quot;I know, I thought so too. It was a pretty close call…</p>

        <p class="card-text">I get so hot and bothered down below, you know what I mean, when I play games with Robert that I sometimes want to loose control of myself completely. He says I shouldn&#039;t because our ages are so different. All I can do is tell you what went on last time we met and hope that someone can offer a solution.
Robert has a boat and spends his life floating around the canals of England. Last weekend he asked me to meet him near Burton–on–Trent at 6 on Friday evening. After work I had a really good drink and caught the train. By 6 I had been on the way for 2 hours and it was another half hour walk to his boat. There&#039;s probably a lot of nice respectable people in Burton so they were probably rather shocked by seeing us…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Each wet weekend May and I have three sessions. Friday there is the need to hydrate and that means establishing a level playing field. What with drinking tea and coffee as well as alcohol we often start off in a dehydrated condition so we play &#039;hold it&#039; to start with. If we meet in a public place its off to the pub and take in a pint or two of shandy followed by fresh orange. The task is then to reach the boat without losing any.
After eating, the next round is usually messy involving May finding interesting and unexpected ways to force me to put my clothing in the washing basket. Anticipating when she will do this has become one of my major tasks since she is cunning. Once she held until after the meal then…</p>
