        <p class="card-text">This is a story about male and female desperation. It happened at a concert last summer.... And yes... that&#039;s me in the pictures.
It was a hot July night and a very popular band was playing at an outdoor concert in the park. My friend Jess, and our dates Mark and Brad were all going to go with me to the concert. It started at 9pm, but at about 7pm we all met at Mark&#039;s house to have a few drinks before we left. There would be a beer gardens there but we wanted to get buzzed before we got there. Since it was a warm night Jess and I were both wearing tank tops, me with a skirt and her with shorts. Both the guys just had on t–shirts and khaki shorts. We started with a couple shots each and then switched to beer,…</p>

        <p class="card-text">A Few Good Stories While I Wait
So, I&#039;m sitting here on my day off doing absolutely nothing. Well, not nothing...I&#039;m listening to music and looking at dirty pictures on the Internet. A pastime I don&#039;t tell anyone about. I also have a very full bladder...another hobby I don&#039;t tell anyone about.
I am so wet right now that my pants are damp, although I haven&#039;t actually lost control yet. Really, I&#039;ve never gotten that far. Whether it&#039;s from fear, boredom, or intolerance to pain, I don&#039;t know, but I&#039;ve tried countless times. I always end up giving in and getting on the toilet. Maybe this time...
While I was living with John I discovered this odd (?) fetish of mine. He was telling me a story. It goes something…</p>

        <p class="card-text">There was no doubt in the collective minds of any of Kristi&#039;s family. The tall blonde eighteen year old could pee. Not pee in the conventional average normal definition of the word. No, her urinations could easily take on superhuman characteristics in the early morning hours of dawn. The incessant endless splattering of her urine acted as an alarm clock for her two sisters and her mother still in their beds. Her characteristic interval pee–pause, pee and pause would drone on and on, until at last the very unrelenting unceasing nature of it would finally rouse the other three who would file into the bathroom shaking their heads.
As Kristi blossomed into young womanhood, puberty seemed to of had the…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Captain Holt had called over to Strechley Manor that morning to inspect the latest hunter that Mr. Blakley had acquired, and he had spent two enjoyable hours devoted to equestrian matters and drinking ale with Mr. Blakley and his head groom. Then he had been obliged to call into the house and pay his respects to Mrs. Blakley and her two daughters, discovering to his pleasure, that Florence Galworth was also present. He was given no option but to accompany these ladies on a drive in their new carriage, and before leaving, to sample some of Mrs. Blakley&#039;s tea, a drink that she specialized in providing in numerous varieties.

It had been a really lovely day. We&#039;d been camping for almost a week and Des and I were so close it was perfect! We shared everything, told each other everything – a magical relationship, in fact.
We&#039;d been together for about two years, and once – and only once – I&#039;d told him how I felt about getting desperate to pee. He&#039;d taken it well; excited even – but I&#039;ll tell that story another time!
There had been a couple of times on this camping trip when one or the other of us had been pretty desperate but we&#039;d always managed to reach a bathroom before disaster struck and on this particular night I was hot and ready for something to…</p>
