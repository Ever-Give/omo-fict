Martin tapped his foot impatiently. Three pints and no toilet break. His bladder was struggling to contain the liquid, but he took a gulp of his fourth pint regardless. He was seated in a booth at the back of the bar, away from the view of other punters. This he was thankful for. He couldn&#039;t refrain from fidgeting; scissoring his legs and clamping his thighs together, but acting in this manner would have been embarrassing in front of others.
As he reached again for his glass, a strong surge of desperation struck him. He gasped audibly, straightening his back to give his bladder more room to expand. With his hands planted firmly on his knees,…</p>

        <p class="card-text">I was driving home from the office. I was alone in the car, and suddenly the traffic slowed and came to an abrupt halt. For the next half hour we started, crawled, and stopped, covering about half a mile. Up ahead there was a bus stop and about twenty folk waiting. I glanced in the mirrors and could see no bus behind me. I felt sorry for them because I guessed they&#039;d got a fair wait ahead of them. As I looked at them I noticed one, a dark haired lady in her twenties jogging up and down. Suddenly her hand went between her legs and she bent forwards at the waist, bending her knees. Slowly she straightened up and seemed to regain control, but then she went into a pee dance, hopping rapidly from one foot to the…</p>

Our bladders we&#039;d been filling by the chimney without care, In hopes that even St. Nicholas our pants could not spare;
Then we&#039;d nestled down all snug in our bed, While visions of sexy accidents danced in our heads;
And mamma in her panties and I in my cap, Had just settled in, but for much more than a winter&#039;s nap;
When out on the lawn there arose such a clatter, Our hands sprang to our pants stop the leaking from our bladders;
Away to the window we flew like a flash, And stood crossing our legs while we threw up the sash;
The moon on my wife&#039;s breasts, which were as white as snow, Gave the…</p>

When I was eighteen, I spent four weeks in hospital after falling off a roof and breaking both arms, dislocating one and giving my back a nasty jolt. I spent quite a lot of this time with my arms encased in itchy plaster and suspended by wires to prevent me from moving them. I was lucky that my father had the kind of job that offered good medical cover, and I had a private room. To be honest, I would rather have been in one of the wards with other kids my age so that I would have had people to talk to, but since the insurance company was paying, my dad wanted me to have the best.
The hospital boasted some very…</p>

Doctor Annabel Hart. The pretty young redhead&#039;s green eyes sparkled as she stared in amazement at the shingle hanging outside her office. She had thought, more than once, that this day would never come. Still, she had persevered, working long hours to support her schooling and even longer hours to pass medical school. The sleepless nights and heavy schedule had granted Annabel her most intense desire, but at the price of any social life. In fact she had no friends outside the stodgy little medical school she had attended. She thought it was worth it. Social opportunities would come when she…</p>

I dumped Melissa and boy did she ever get revenge. I was out at a bar with my new girlfriend Kristan one night drinking. As usual, Kristan was decked out in her skin–tight stretch jeans with black boots and tank top. Her ass was unbelievable in her light, skin–tight jeans. There we were drinking and having a good time when I spotted Melissa across the bar. Melissa was about ten years older than me and we had dated about a year. It used to be a real turn on for me that she was around 40 and I was 30. I used to love the way she would dress – everything skin–tight. Tonight was no different. She looked hot wearing a pair of…</p>

Mrs. Hauser was my PE coach in college. She was known for being a real bitch, and for having an incredible ass that she always showed off in tight jeans and skin–tight sweat pants. She developed the bitch reputation for not allowing people to leave to use the restroom in her class.
Inevitably, once or twice a year, she&#039;d make some poor freshman wet their pants in front of the entire class without fail. She seemed to get some type of sadistic pleasure out of watching you squirm until you flooded the pants you were wearing. She was especially mean to the guys, as I unfortunately found out my senior year in college.

I was on vacation in a resort town somewhere in the Pacific. I had just received my diving certification and was eager to get to it. Before I arrived I had booked several dives with a local company, and on the day of my &#039;discovery&#039; we were to make two dives, both along the reef wall. Of course I wouldn&#039;t be alone; five others had been booked in my group.

        <p class="card-text">Frank Jarmon is looking forward to the weekend with more than his usual enthusiasm. The 54–year–old environmental technician normally has his time fully occupied with his two grown kids, his 14 year old, 2 grandkids and 2 more on the way. Put that together with the demands of friends and relatives and free time became a bit rare. His plans for this weekend include none of them, only himself and lots of liquids. He has gotten a head start on the planned activities by not visiting the restroom since lunch. This fact is being reviewed with caution now. It&#039;s still an hour before he gets off and his bladder is requesting relief; more than a little insistently. Frank calculates his need and wonders; his bladder is…</p>

        <p class="card-text">I&#039;ll begin with an introduction I suppose. I&#039;m a 20–year–old female, bisexual, name withheld, with a fetish for male and female desperation, although I&#039;ll admit I enjoy male desperation a bit more. (What can I say? I love the cock.) Anyway, the following is a few stories about my then boyfriend, let&#039;s call him Jake because I&#039;m not about to give out any names, who was known for his habit of forgetting to/never wanting to use the bathroom, or simply not noticing he had to go until it was critical. He&#039;d just try to ignore it, saying nothing, because he was having a good time with his friends or sit down to try and alleviate the pain until he could take it no longer, and suddenly dash off to the bathroom. I have…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Godfrey was sat on the train, reading his newspaper on his way home from a business trip. It was a two–carriage train and it was beginning to fill up, but the seat next to him was still empty, which pleased him. At the next station, however, several more passengers got on, including a very pretty blonde girl in her early twenties, who came and sat next to him. Godfrey shuffled up a bit to make room for the young lady. As the train pulled out of the station the young lady looked round and upon seeing that everyone was seated, she got up and went toward the toilet. She returned almost immediately and sat down looking a little irritated and uncomfortable. &quot;Typical of this damned rail company,&quot; she complained to…</p>

George prides himself on his analytical skills and determination to get things done. Now, however, George is simply baffled. His latest device fails to work. He has checked and rechecked his design; this doesn&#039;t happen to him. Based on secret medical data, the device is intended to project a signal to enemy soldiers, which will be received directly into the brain. This signal is computer generated and intended to mimic human synaptic generation. The frequency projected is a type of biosynthetic feedback cycling sine wave, modulating throughout an identified human receptive range. Its purpose is…</p>

She had a pretty smile and long blonde hair and a tiny sexy body. And she was wearing a cheerleader uniform.
