        <p class="card-text">Here&#039;s another letter from Robert and I but we&#039;ve tried to stick to what happened around the time of the &#039;floods&#039; at the end of 2000.
Robert&#039;s boat has been out of action for a while so we had our wet weekend at his house and you&#039;d be surprised how close it is to yours.
As usual I arrived at the station full to overflowing. Now I&#039;m not very good at geography and when Robert said to take the train to Dewsbury I thought it must be the station nearest to his house so it was a bit of a surprise when he said we had to go another half an hour by car.
He had borrowed a neighbor&#039;s car and so we had to keep it dry. I&#039;m all right in a train but the jiggling of a car plays havoc with my lower parts. I shuffled about…</p>

While cruising around the canals of England I stopped for the night in rural Warwickshire and wandered back along the towpath for a mile or so to an eighteenth century pub for a pint or two. On the way back the urge to pee arrived which is never a problem either in the country or on a boat, there&#039;s hardly ever anyone around. Being a half decent sort of chap I hopped over a gate into a field of sheep and had just opened up when a voice shouted, &quot;There he is.&quot; I closed…</p>

I wish Robert had let me type this because I&#039;d have done it better.
To explain about me first: I was always the fat girl at school, the one nobody wanted on their team. I grew up on a new housing estate in a town in Cheshire and I really only had one friend, that was Rachel who was tall&amp; thin. The girls said &quot;Here comes 10&quot; because she looked like a 1 and I was short and round. She used to come by my house almost every day till we were 16 then she left school and got a job. I stayed on and was very lonely.
After A levels I found a job as the office…</p>

I finally worked up the courage to have a public wetting &quot;accident&quot;. I decided on a mall as the location. I didn&#039;t want to use a mall near my home for fear of being seen by someone I know, or worse yet someone who is friends with my wife. I had some errands to complete first; bank, post office etc. I drank water as I drove from one location to another. When it was time to drive to the mall I picked up two beers and another water for the ride. The mall is located in Dutchess County, New York, about 30 – 40 minutes from my home. As I was driving I could feel the pressure building.
Driving on the highway kept my mind focused and I paid…</p>

        <p class="card-text">On their second date Bruce and Nancy were ensconced in a neighborhood tavern where they were drinking beer and scarfing up on all the goodies that were served at the bar. They had gobbled up six or seven beers by early afternoon and a couple of bowls of chips and popcorn. After the first six beers they had both relieved themselves and were quite aware of further requirements for relieving themselves. 
Before the next requirement came to their attention, Bruce suggested that they retire to his garden apartment to grill some steaks on the balcony. Nancy thought it was a great idea and stood up to prepare to leave. Both Bruce and Nancy had a slightly full bladder but both thought that they were in control. As…</p>

Bruce enjoyed a few beers at his favorite bar. As a matter of fact he enjoyed too many beers. When he left to pick Nancy up he had already violated the rule of six. The rule of six means that when you have had six beers you will probably need to pee. And, when you answer that need all subsequent needs become very urgent needs. In short, while the first pee when beer drinking can be put off for a long time the next and all subsequent calls to pee are urgent. Once one has acknowledged the…</p>

Casey expressed the interest of getting me into a situation where she could get me desperate to go. She said the ultimate goal was to see me soak myself. I was a bit turned on by the idea.

I had played for as long as I can remember, and was ready to go on to more difficult pieces – thence the private lessons. Miss Anderson was around thirty and usually dressed in proper skirt and blouse, with her auburn hair tied into a bun. Still, she was the object of my fantasies, being a woman who took me seriously, as opposed to the girls of my own age, who were either plain and giggly or pretty and condescending. She was petite, about my height at that time, and the decent clothes did not hide her womanly shape. I kept my dreams a secret for four years. After returning that autumn from three months&#039; break, I found myself a couple of inches taller, with…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Wow what a weekend I just had, let me tell you all about it! Last weekend it was the Queen&#039;s Golden Jubilee celebration down in London. My wealthy but divorced cousin Fran was very lucky and got two tickets in her grown up daughters&#039; names for the pop concert on the Monday night in the Garden at Buckingham Palace. Claire, 24 and Holly, 20, the two very good looking daughters, top shelf in fact, were to be the lucky recipients of the tickets. Both girls live in Chelsea. Fran asked me if I would like to go down to London for the weekend. Our families are very close as we all grew up together in the same town. Fran is 10 years older than I, and seems to be missing male company since her messy divorce. She felt…</p>

        <p class="card-text">A couple of weeks ago I headed out to a concert with some friends, of which once again included my sexy neighbor Casey. After Casey&#039;s wet incident on her birthday the two of us had gotten closer and even a bit sexual together one night while watching a movie. So the night of this concert rolls around and Casey and I were picked up by three of our friends, Ben, D.J., and Hillary. We all rode to the show in Ben&#039;s Tahoe truck. We got there plenty early because we always like to tailgate and have some drinks before heading in. 
The concert was being held at a nearby arena and traffic was already getting backed up when we got there. By the time we found a parking spot it was pretty far off from the arena.

        <p class="card-text">The following accounts are true, only the names have been changed to protect the guilty.
Back in the early 1980&#039;s I became involved with a sexy blonde girl named Mindy who was a former stripper. At the time we were both in our mid 20&#039;s. She was a big girl, not fat by any means but what most would call statuesque. About 150 lbs, 5&#039; 11&quot;, large pendulous tits, a nice round ass, and legs a mile long which she loved to show off with short mini–skirts. She turned heads wherever we went, both male and female.
The sex was hot from the start, and within a few months we were living together. She was quite open–minded sexually and we experimented with just about everything including pee fun. While this did not turn her…</p>

While my mom had really tried to get me dry, and eventually forbade me to use diapers, I had hardly moved to my first own apartment when I ran out to purchase large amounts of diapers and everything that was needed besides them. Since the day had been exhausting, I had gone to bed early and happily in diapers. My subconscious seemed to have grasped the fact, for that night I wasn&#039;t plagued by bad dreams of searching desperately for a toilet, while the pressure in my bladder grew worse and worse – but I guess you know this type of nightmares.
