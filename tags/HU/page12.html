        <p class="card-text">Nancy was well aware of the beer drinker&#039;s rule of thumb; during the first six beers you will most likely forgo taking a trip to the rest room. But, when you finally do succumb to an aching bladder after the first six you will find that you have to answer the call immediately and that the call will occur often. More accidents occur after the first six beers in a beer drinking session than at any other time. Nancy had numerous experiences with beer drinking sessions but she had never had an accident until... Nancy was in a neighborhood tavern drinking with her new boyfriend and she noticed that she had just finished her sixth beer. She excused herself and went to the restroom to relieve herself in a normal…</p>

        <p class="card-text">From the time Nancy was nine years old she had accompanied her father on fishing trips.
In fact the whole family occasionally went along and they picnicked. Nancy&#039;s father was an avid fly fisherman and since Nancy was like all young daughters she wanted to engage in her fathers favorite pastime. When she was thirteen she was an accomplished fly fisherman. By the time she reached fourteen, her parents had divorced. Nancy was sent to live with her mother. She was devastated; she loved being with her Dad. After that, she was only able to see him sporadically, due to school and his work schedule. 
One Friday evening after Nancy had reached the age of eighteen her father called and asked if she wanted to go trout…</p>

Also the cheer leading team and other fans that had gotten permission to ride the school bus to the game were boarding for the return trip home. The fact that their team had won sort of threw the schedule and pre–boarding activities out of kilter. Nancy danced and pranced around the boarding area congratulating each of the team members as they boarded their special bus. She ignored the fact that her dancing and prancing concealed a need to void her bladder. 
When the team was boarded it was announced that the fans and cheerleaders would have to board also as they were to return caravan style. Nancy boarded one of the two…</p>

Hurriedly, she closed the passenger door of her Mom&#039;s minivan quickly, hopping out to the ground, yelling at her mother to hurry. Knees knocked together, the girl was in a panic. &quot;Mom, hurry up!&quot; she yelled, &quot;I really gotta go to the bathroom, come on, let&#039;s go inside before I have an accident right here!&quot; I had just pulled into the parking lot, ready to grab some lunch and I had to use the bathroom pretty badly myself.

        <p class="card-text">A few weeks after I had peed my jeans in the rain with my sister I was in the park with a good friend of mine, Jo–Anne. We were goofing around and having fun in the nice weather when Jo–Anne suddenly told me we had to find a toilet. She had had to pee for a while, as did I, and a bit escaped. We went to where the toilets were in the park, or rather, usually were. The city had apparently had had enough of the vandalism, and the toilets had been removed. Jo–Anne doubled over in pain and told me she&#039;d never make it home. She barely got here and she was about to pee her jeans. I felt sorry for her and told her she would be able to make it if she just tried. With a tear falling down her cheek she told me she couldn…</p>

I was wearing black knickers, a blue skirt down to my knees, and a white T–shirt. After a while, I began to feel the need to pee. I ignored it, and I continued to watch my sisters. My family said they were going home for an hour, leaving me on my own with them, a responsibility thing they said. After a short while, I really needed to pee. I crossed my legs, which helped, but it couldn&#039;t hold for long. I could feel the pressure on my bladder; it was sort of a dead weight.

Jane had arrived suffering from a bladder complaint that left her with feeble control of her bladder and inclined toward having accidents. Her embarrassing state would be made worse if any sexual stimulation were indulged in; as it inevitably delayed the time it would take for the complaint to get better. Unfortunately, the medication that Jane was taking had a side effect that caused such vaginal irritation it drove Jane to near nymphomania.
