        <p class="card-text">Gina, Carol and Fiona were 24 year old triplets, and pretty much identical. The only really obvious difference between them was their hair. Gina wore her natural blonde locks flowing down to the middle of her back. Carol had dyed her hair black and wore it to the shoulders with a severe fringe halfway up her forehead. Fiona had kept her hair blonde but had it cropped close to the scalp.
The girls were sitting in the garden of a man whose money they loved. Uncle Joe, as he liked to be known to them, was celebrating his 65th birthday and he&#039;d invited only three guests – the triplets. He&#039;d known the girls most of their lives as he&#039;d been their fathers business partner. When the girls were 17 their parents were…</p>

        <p class="card-text">October 8, 2002 was a bitter day for our little software company. We had begun the firm almost as kids and soared to the heights of the tech boom not as millionaires, but amazingly affluent for young adults in our late 20s. Fortunately, we were a solid company with a good product. We didn&#039;t tank when the bubble burst, but we definitely were no longer looking at retirement in our 30s as we all had imagined.
What really stung, though, was when it became apparent that takeover by one of the larger telecom concerns was inevitable. The offer was reasonable, we had incurred minor debt, and there was no question our financial security depended on selling out to a more secure operation. We were coming out alright,…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Irene is a tall sexy 49–year–old legal secretary. She has found time from her busy schedule to go a one day school reunion where a mock normal school day will be had by all attending for their pleasure (or so Irene thought).
It is an afternoon class and at lunchtime Irene has consumed 2 large glasses of coke and 2 bottles of water.
The first sign that the day isn&#039;t going as planned is about 15 minutes into the afternoon class when the woman sitting next to Irene, Celia, put her hand up and said to the teacher, &quot;Please Miss Jones, Irene has just kicked me under the table.&quot;
Miss Jones looked angrily across to Irene and called her to the front of the class and said, &quot;Irene, I am going to make an example of you…</p>

He had been with a wedding party all day, most of which took place out of doors at a vast estate in the English countryside. Once evening came, the party moved to an enormous house, practically labyrinthine, five stories or more, the rooms and passageways innumerable, and as Reginald was soon to discover, nearly impossible to navigate if unfamiliar.
He had been out of doors and in the company of others for the entire day, (as this particular wedding party was very large, over two hundred people, most of them high aristocracy, and…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Chloe was an 18–year–old girl, who was studying for her A levels at a very strict school in England. She lived with her 3 older brothers who were very highly sexed and loved seeing girls bursting for a pee. They also lived with her parents who knew nothing of their sons&#039; peculiar pastime and were very prim and proper. They would think that the sight of an 18 year old wetting her pants was an absolute disgrace, and could not even imagine that anyone could &#039;get off&#039; on such a thing.
Well one Friday evening the brothers decided that it would be amazing to contrive a plan, working together to make Chloe absolutely desperate for a pee, and then ultimately wee in her knickers in public.

I finally worked up the courage to have a public wetting &quot;accident&quot;. I decided on a mall as the location. I didn&#039;t want to use a mall near my home for fear of being seen by someone I know, or worse yet someone who is friends with my wife. I had some errands to complete first; bank, post office etc. I drank water as I drove from one location to another. When it was time to drive to the mall I picked up two beers and another water for the ride. The mall is located in Dutchess County, New York, about 30 – 40 minutes from my home.

        <p class="card-text">Saturday, 6am: Danielle paced nude through her hotel room, coffee in hand, the sunlight streaming through the windows, making geometric patterns along the carpet. She looked at her watch. Another hour, and she had to be down the block at the old loft. Thankfully it was a nice day outside, and the walk would be short. Danielle stared at her suitcase. Picked a pair of black tights, a very short plaid miniskirt and a black long sleeve top. She skipped the bra; 34A wasn&#039;t going to get anyone&#039;s attention, and she hated the things anyway. Plus, she thought, she liked the feeling of the supple fabric of her top against her bare breasts. Underwear, she thought, what to wear. Ah, a tight fitting pair of panties, a snug…</p>

        <p class="card-text">This story is one of my fantasies (based on some fact) but is not meant to be in any way disrespectful to the very real problem of bullying in schools.
Making my way to the ladies&#039; room I saw them, three girls standing in the hall, their uniforms the same as mine, but that&#039;s where the similarity ended. My name is Mary. I attended my local school, but even at 18 I was still being bullied– by Heather and her two cronies.
I had refused to give them any money or CDs and they wanted to push me. Heather called me over and I went timidly pulling my blazer over my dark blue pleated skirt (ballerina length) and white blouse.
Suddenly I had a thought. Anything is better than the insults and pain so I increased my leg…</p>

        <p class="card-text">This story is based on real facts. (Everything related in it its true and happened some time ago).
On a fine sunny Friday of late May, my ex girlfriend and I decided to go on a trip to the mountains, just the two of us. (It was actually planned to make things work better between us.)
So on that Friday afternoon we went to the station and we took the train to Brasov situated 140 Kilometers from our city. From there we took a bus to the resort where we were going.
We arrived at about 6:00 pm, and we took out a room in a villa. Things were going really well. After settling down we went down to a club to spend our first evening. (This was at about 8:30 pm)
My girlfriend, Maria, was dressed in a nice pair of…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Bruce was to pick Nancy up at 5:00 PM. It was midsummer and Bruce had gotten off early from work. So Bruce went to his favorite bar to while the hours away until it became time to pick Nancy up from her place of employment.
Bruce enjoyed a few beers at his favorite bar. As a matter of fact he enjoyed too many beers. When he left to pick Nancy up he had already violated the rule of six. The rule of six means that when you have had six beers you will probably need to pee. And, when you answer that need all subsequent needs become very urgent needs. In short, while the first pee when beer drinking can be put off for a long time the next and all subsequent calls to pee are urgent. Once one has acknowledged the…</p>
