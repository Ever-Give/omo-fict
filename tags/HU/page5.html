&quot;Oh Trev, apparently it&#039;s HUGE, everyone will be there!&quot; Nick rolls his eyes, and smiles.
&quot;Alrighty, what time?&quot;
&quot;Well, we could go early I thought, We could have a few drinks here before we go too, I wanted to drink that Chambord, I would take it but I don&#039;t want those assholes to get their hands on it, so we&#039;ll start drinking here, and…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Oh no, I woke up too late!
Glanced at the clock, quarter past eight
I hurried into my pink panties and short skirt
Covered up my C cup titties with a tight shirt
Grabbed a quick bite and drink
Already need to pee, but no time to I think
I rush quickly out the door
Already getting desperate for sure
I made it to the bus stop just in time
Got another soda, this one lemon &amp; lime
I let my blonde hair fall down
So beautiful all the other girls cried and frowned
I felt my bladder start to fill up
Hoping I could make it to my bus stop
So thirsty I had to drink another one
Crossing my legs now, this should be fun
Wriggling my legs while sitting on the bus
Hoping to not wet myself and make a fuss
I…</p>

Lisa looked up at Christy confused and Christy smirked at her, saying, &quot;If you&#039;re going to be wetting your pants like a baby, then we need to treat you like one! I want you to go to the store and buy some diapers and a pacifier. Also buy a pair of handcuffs.&quot;
Lisa threw her arms in the air and looked down at her soaking wet jeans. Christy smiled and said, &quot;You&#039;re going just like you are now.&quot; She looked up at the clock. &quot;Hurry, baby, I&#039;m timing you.&quot; Christy lay on the couch and turned on the television.

        <p class="card-text">Victoria Gray smoothed down the skirt of her Armani dress, anxious that it should not wrinkle. She wanted to look every bit the $500 it had cost. It looked marvellous on her tall, willowy form, and she knew it. The choice made specifically for her performance evaluation that afternoon, looked smart, professional, and elegant, a garment to suit board members from the highly conservative to the outright lascivious.
Victoria knew she was a hot contender for promotion to Assistant Regional Director of Highline Apparel, probably the fastest growing quality fashion chain on the east coast. She needed to look the part if she was going to go places within the company.

        <p class="card-text">Ellen was a colleague of mine at a large advertising agency. She and I were competing for the same promotion. The bosses at the agency made it clear that the winner got the job, and the loser had to leave.
Ellen is a bright and attractive woman in her late 30&#039;s who was completely driven by work and success. So far as anyone knew, she had no private life. Her dress was stylish, but her in–office demeanor very prim. Ellen also never admitted mistake, nor showed any remorse. Her goal was to succeed by any means necessary. We did not work together, and our relationship was limited to saying hello to one another in the hallways.
For six solid months Ellen and I competed for the coveted vice–president&#039;s position.…</p>

The damned place was always short of staff, and her stints on the checkout were always far longer than they were supposed to be. She had started this session at five o&#039;clock to cope with the influx of customers who stopped to shop for groceries on the way home from work.

She&#039;s very pretty, long tanned legs, tight ass, 36C cup, and sexy brunette hair to match her cute brown eyes. She&#039;s also very bisexual; she may even prefer girls to guys. And for the past few months she&#039;s been toying over the Internet, getting interested in the idea of being dominant and having a submissive girl. And today was the day she was going to meet the girl she had been talking with for those few months. From the pictures she saw, Christy is a feisty redhead girl with shoulder length curly hair who is athletic and has perky tits.

As a divorcee of 30, Lindsay was flattered when one of the younger men at work asked her to join a group of his friends going to the rugby match. The group consisted of two other couples who were all in their 20&#039;s. The other two girls were Tracy, about 25, slim with dark hair and thick glasses, which spoiled her looks, and Belinda, well built, a blonde about 28. Both were casually dressed, Tracy in the tightest pair of jeans you could imagine, and Belinda in a denim mini–skirt, which was both short and tight. Lindsay had also gone for the casual look, wearing jeans, not as tight as Tracy&#039;s with a sweater and anorak. As you might expect from a rugby crowd, they met in a pub…</p>

She sat there, letting the warm sun soak her through the windows, glistening on her tight, tan body. She ran her hand over her rock hard abs and smiled as she looked down at herself. She loved her body and she loved the attention it got. She didn&#039;t have a boyfriend but she loved fucking a different guy every night. She knew she was a total slut and didn&#039;t care. She sat there thinking how it was Thursday, wishing it were Friday so she could go clubbing. It wasn&#039;t worth going on Thursday nights, though; the clubs weren&#039;t even half packed.

        <p class="card-text">Alyssa, Elizabeth and Michelle were three sisters from the oldest to the youngest, who had been chatting and drinking at a bar. The beers went by and the conversation was so interesting that they hadn&#039;t remembered to go to the bathroom, but finally they realised that their bladders were dangerously full. The first to notice it was the middle one.
Elizabeth: &quot;Girls, I&#039;ll be back in a minute, I need to use the toilet.&quot;
Michelle: &quot;Wait, I&#039;ll go with you, I need it too.&quot;
Alyssa: &quot;Hey, don&#039;t leave me here alone, you aren&#039;t the only ones that have several beers inside!&quot;
Elizabeth: &quot;Ok, but I called it first, so one of you&#039;ll have to wait here to watch our stuff while the other one comes with me.&quot;
Alyssa: …</p>

        <p class="card-text">Kristan enjoyed skiing. She and Brad were on their way to the ski resort and she couldn&#039;t be happier. She wore her skin–tight jeans because she knew that they drove Brad crazy. This was their first date, so Kristan was incredibly nervous. And when she gets nervous, she has accidents. Nevertheless, when Brad offered her some coffee to warm up on the way to the slopes, she accepted. When they got to the resort, Kristan began to feel the urge to pee. Brad was eager to hit the slopes though after the long 2–hour drive, so she agreed to take a few runs before going to the lodge.
She put on her skis and teetered her way to the lift. Brad held her hand as they slowly slid their way onto the bench. The seat came in…</p>

I dumped Melissa and boy did she ever get revenge. I was out at a bar with my new girlfriend Kristan one night drinking. As usual, Kristan was decked out in her skin–tight stretch jeans with black boots and tank top. Her ass was unbelievable in her light, skin–tight jeans. There we were drinking and having a good time when I spotted Melissa across the bar. Melissa was about ten years older than me and we had dated about a year. It used to be a real turn on for me that she was around 40 and I was 30. I used to love the way she would dress – everything skin–tight. Tonight was no different. She looked hot wearing a pair of…</p>

John Gallagher gave her a reproving glance as she rejoined him. &quot;Keep under cover before somebody sees you,&quot; he warned in a harsh whisper.
&quot;I can&#039;t help it,&quot; Allison snapped. &quot;I&#039;m dying for the loo.&quot;
&quot;Look,&quot; Gallagher said, &quot;If someone looks out of the back windows of that warehouse and sees you strutting up and down out here, the whole operation will be blown.&quot;
&quot;Alright, alright,&quot; Allison conceded. &quot;I just hope something happens soon, because I can&#039;t wait much longer.&quot;

Part Two
The polished hardwood floor of the ballroom glistened; the lights from the chandeliers overhead were reflected in the varnish of the wood. Spacious, the room stretched from one end of the old mansion to the other, high ceilings adorned with artwork, sculptures embedded in the royal columns that supported the old roof. A long bar, covered in black velvet formed the right border of the room, in the back, a double doorway led to the hallway of the old mansion. Before the doorway, still in the ballroom, a small antique table with an old lamp on it and a set of ledgers…</p>
