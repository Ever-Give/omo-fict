Jae and Penny hurried uncomfortably through the Maxiversity hallway to the next exam session. One hellish semester, six humiliating months, behind them, and still no sign of the promised revolution. Even Lisa, the eternal optimist of the Bird Women, and Caryn, the most muscular and intimidating of the oppressed group, were losing their hope. Doing her best to ignore the intense summons emanating from between her long legs, Jae shuddered to think what she and her friends would do without Lisa and Caryn to give them hope.
&quot;D&#039;you think this bunch will be as rude as the boys from last week?&quot; Jae asked Penny between short breaths.
&quot;Hope not,&quot; the shorter girl answered. &quot;You&#039;d…</p>

The wait paid off, for when Katie rounded the corner towards the history library a few moments past 8:00, Penny was sitting at a table there, pretending to read an old Time magazine. &quot;Hi!&quot; Katie said cheerfully as she sat down. For once, the cheerfulness wasn&#039;t made up; Katie was delighted to have this slender reed of hope to cling to.
Penny was happy – for the first time since the Deluge – as well. &quot;Hey! I was just reading about Watergate here. It&#039;s amazing how far back the magazines go.&quot; As she closed the magazine, she couldn&#039;t help allowing a nervous glance at the Swineherd standing guard by the library door, not even fifteen feet away. They&#039;d found each other, but…</p>

Neither of us had been able to go to the bathroom for several hours and both of us had imbibed a few beers just before the concert. Now we were standing on the platform waiting for my car while there were many other patrons doing the same. While I was somewhat uncomfortable with the stress on my bladder, I couldn&#039;t help but notice that Loretta was getting desperate for a pee.
She shifted her weight from one foot to the other and occasionally walked around in a small circle. She was wearing an off–white suit with a straight skirt and powder blue blouse. She didn&#039;t mention…</p>

Episode 5 – Wet by Dawn
Laurie&#039;s jeep stopped with screeching tires in front of the fraternity house where the big party was being held. She and Cathy had been able to hear the music from down the road, but they weren&#039;t there to party. Cathy jumped out of the jeep immediately as it came to a halt and crossed her legs with both hands grabbing at her crotch.
&quot;I don&#039;t care what you say,&quot; she snapped at Laurie, &quot;the first thing that I am going to do, is go to the bathroom!&quot;
&quot;That&#039;s where we have to go,&quot; Laurie replied as she got out too and walked toward the entrance with her thighs clamped tightly together all the time.

        <p class="card-text">Hello!
This is a true story about my first peeing accident on our short trip to Paris.
I am a 20 years old girl from Germany and I had a very bad peeing accident last week at our school trip to France. It was a very hot day when we had our last day in Paris. It was 8 or 9 o&#039;clock p.m. when we left our hotel and put the luggage in the bus. We had to drive nearly 10 hours home, so my friend Marie and I bought 2 six packs beer and a bottle wine to have a party during this long journey. We drank a lot and had a lot of fun.
After 2 hours I first recognized that my bladder was full. The toilet in the bus was defective so we had a break every 2 hours to go to the bathroom. The last break was only 15 minutes ago so…</p>

The ticket counter was at one end of the hallway, the performance reception, put on by a local arts association was at the other. That&#039;s where I saw Sarah that night. Working behind the reception table, serving punch to the many visitors, all alone, trying her best to keep up with the masses eating the cheap cookies, home baked cakes and drinking the fruit punch (non alcoholic, to my dismay).

They&#039;re trouble. Nothing serious you understand. We&#039;re not talking violence here, but they do have weird senses of humor that leave the victim often failing to see the funny side. For example a girl I know was walking past one of their houses when she got utterly drenched by a bucketful of water dropped on her from a bathroom window.

        <p class="card-text">Where Robert lives they have an agricultural show each year. There are pens of animals, rabbits in cages, plates of vegetables and flowers, tables of jam, a beer tent, lots of little girls and their ponies– all set around a marquee where they award the prizes. We only went for a quick look round after our midday snack hoping to be back for an afternoon in the garden.
The field where the cars are parked being some distance from the show site we had to join a crowd picking its way through the heaps of dung left by the cattle. I spent ages along the row of cages with pets. Again there was a lot of dung. Moving on to the ponies I had my third encounter with this dung, which the country people seem quite happy…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Saturday night and Lemonade was packed from wall to wall with gorgeous girls. Stella looked around her in wonder. Her London friends had been right; Lemonade was definitely Manchester&#039;s hottest lesbian nightclub. Quality tunes pulsed from the decks and quality girls filled every corner. Serious female talent stretched from the strobing dance floor to the secluded alcoves where several sets of faces were already pressed together.
A girl, that was what Stella needed now. There was definitely enough to choose from. Some possibilities had already caught her gaze– maybe the strawberry blonde at the bar, or the little Chinese girl. Yes, the little Chinese girl in the even smaller tight white dress had definitely…</p>

        <p class="card-text">I continue my theme of female desperation with a middle aged, well to do, well–dressed woman caught short in at least a semi public situation. I continually tire of stories about younger women that are provocatively dressed.
What a nightmare. Joan was sitting in her car and the traffic was backed up for miles; there seemed to be no way off the rural road she was stuck on, a combination of rain and sleet was pouring down, but worst off all... she had to go to the bathroom! Badly!!!
She had been to a dinner party with other people from her office where she had imbibed lots of wine and coffee. While she dutifully used the ladies&#039; room before she left, most of the liquid she had consumed hadn&#039;t reached her…</p>

        <p class="card-text">I was seated at the computer and surfing the Web. I&#039;d only just got online and this was a new experience. Well, not so much the Web surfing, I&#039;d done that at work, but obviously there were certain kinds if sites that I didn&#039;t dare look at in work. I couldn&#039;t afford to lose my job because I&#039;d been on an inappropriate site. I don&#039;t know how they found out what you&#039;ve been looking at and I didn&#039;t want to find out.
But now I had the Web at home, I could go where I liked. I&#039;d done a lot of the porn sites, but basically I find staring at naked women rather boring. I have my own girlfriend I can see naked and she&#039;s better looking than most on the Net. So I started looking for something different. A magazine I bought…</p>
