        <p class="card-text">Holly strolled through the city shops without a care in the world. She was browsing for some new sports clothes, window–shopping mainly, and her only purchase so far had been a large coke from McDonalds. Holly was an outgoing girl, and was enjoying being 18 and home from college for the summer. She was wearing an old pair of ripped jeans that she had cut off into shorts, and a red vest with &quot;Party Girl&quot; emblazoned across her firm round breasts. The vest was tight and short, showing her nipples since she wasn&#039;t wearing a bra, while leaving her tummy bare and exposed. She felt the cool air over her bare skin as the afternoon cooled gradually. She took slow, rolling strides from her hips as she walked, and smiled…</p>

Kristine had two fingers pressing on the track&#039;s hard surface, her other arm cocked at her left side. Her Nike track shoes were pressed against the starting blocks, white socks barely showing above the edge of the shoe line, her calve muscles taut, her perfectly shaped, sleek yet athletic thighs tensed as she awaited the starting gunshot. A slight sheen of perspiration shone on her legs and arms. A single drop of perspiration fell from her nose, falling to the tracks surface, a small dark circle where it fell. Crouched in starting stance, her face stared down the straightaway of the track, her butt sticking up in the air, her short green nylon…</p>

It was a day just like every other day after Inuyasha got over his little &quot;transformation.&quot; Unlike other times, they did not have to fight for their lives. It seemed as though the demons of the surrounding territories had taken a break from hunting them.

        <p class="card-text">Just to set the scene, I&#039;m a bi girl, into watching. My name is Summer.
A few years ago, I was on a bus traveling across Australia on my gap year. I was sitting right at the back in the window seat and a pretty, blonde girl was sitting on the opposite side. The desert had been rolling by for hours and I hadn&#039;t really taken much notice of her. But then I noticed she was beginning to fidget. She was trying to read a map, jiggling the whole time. After a minute she turned to me, leaned over the empty seats and said. &quot;Excuse me, do you know how much further we&#039;ve got to go?&quot;
I looked at my watch. &quot;About 2 hours.&quot;
She smiled and thanked me and sat back in her seat. But she couldn&#039;t sit still. She stared out of…</p>

        <p class="card-text">The automatic door of the van hissed with air escaping loudly from the hydraulics, and creaked on old bearings as it slowly opened. The cool night air rushed in to greet the passengers as they stepped out of the vehicle in front of the hotel. Grasping the chrome handrail, they each stepped onto the black stair platform and then onto the asphalt parking lot. The high–rise building was new, the crowning jewel of the airport hotels, rising 15 stories into the clear night sky, suites along the very top floors and well appointed rooms below. Twin miniature man–made lakes were in front, framed by the granite entrance, a pair of palms framing the lakes. The blurred words &quot;HOTEL SHUTTLE&quot; were visible, reflecting in…</p>

After five months of misery with no hope for rescue, they finally had their first real chance; it&#039;s strange how much time seems to slow down as one comes to anticipate a wonderful event. As the Bird Women went through the nightly routine – being blindfolded in the locker room so that they couldn&#039;t see their fellow prisoners, having the blindfolds removed as they were herded into the bathroom stalls so that they could see the Swineherds watching them relieve themselves, having the blindfolds restored as they were sent to an edible but bland dinner…</p>

At one particular casino, which we used to go to quite often, there was a female croupier who was always very jovial and chatty, very different from the sour–faced type that many of them seem to be. Even though she (usually) still managed to take our money, it was always more fun when she was dealing, and all the regular customers knew her quite well, my wife and I included.
I&#039;ll call this croupier Sally for the purpose of telling you about the incident, she was about 20 years old, she did tell us her age once, but I can&#039;t remember. She was nicely slim and had long, slightly curly, blonde hair, and a…</p>

It was two minutes to the start of Free Hour, and Katie had been pacing furiously back and forth across the floor of her hideout, praying that Penny would be there and that she&#039;d had better luck than Katie in tracking down recruits; Katie hadn&#039;t seen Lisa or Caryn at all that day.
Her fears subsided a bit when a tall, stocky girl with blonde curls appeared in the doorway. Initially terrified…</p>

        <p class="card-text">My name is Becky. I&#039;m a Dutch national and a twenty–four year old PA to an advertising executive in Reading, UK, where I live with my boyfriend Marcus, a university tutor who is sixteen years older than me. The following is a true account of a wetting accident that I had in public last month.
It was a warm Saturday afternoon and I had been enjoying lunch at a riverside restaurant with three girlfriends. Marcus had promised to pick me up on his way back from work at 2:30pm but was late, so at 2:50pm I was standing alone in the car park waiting for him. I had drunk three glasses of wine at lunch and was feeling pleasantly merry, but also in desperate need of a wee. I had declined to use the facilities in the…</p>

        <p class="card-text">10:00 AM. Jenny rose off her couch, still in her nightgown, barely out of bed, and walked over to the window. She peered outside at the early summer day, clouds puffy and white in the sky, people walking along the busy street in the harried pace of the office employee, heads down, moving with purpose along the sidewalks. Moving from the window to her dining table, she picked up her resume and read it once again, double–checking for spelling errors and considering yet again rewriting her summary to put a different slant on her skills. The interview was at 12:00 noon downtown, about a mile away from her upscale apartment and Jenny was nervous. She needed a job, and the economic woes had made them scarce to come…</p>

Emily bounced down the college steps and out towards the car park. It had been a typically boring Friday and she was eager forget all about her Business Studies course and concentrate on the evening ahead. She was a little bit late out of school because she had changed out of her Sixth Form uniform in the Ladies&#039; toilets. Now she was wearing a light pink sleeveless tee shirt, tight black stretch–cotton skirt and strappy platforms. She&#039;d put on a little glitter spray too because they were going into town.

        <p class="card-text">It was 1960 when Vicky climbed aboard a Greyhound Bus affiliate that connected her hometown to the main line. It was the cheapest way for Vicky to get to Philadelphia where she had acquired a job writing copy for an advertising agency. It was a Friday morning and she had to report Monday morning at 8:00AM sharp. With the help of her parents she had already arranged for lodging in Philly and she had an advance in cash from her daddy to last until she got her feet on the ground. It was the best she could do with her recent Baccalaureate Degree in English and she was very excited about her prospects. She couldn&#039;t imagine a better starting point.
