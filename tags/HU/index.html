        <p class="card-text">This story contains Female Desperation, Humiliation, Female Wetting, Female Peeing, and Golden Showers. When I got home, no one was around, so I quietly went to my room, changed clothes and went straight to bed. There was so much to dream about: wet panties, soaked pussies, and overwhelming ladies! Two weeks passed and nothing had happened. The weather was rather rainy and I had chosen to ride my bike or hitch a ride whenever some neighbor&#039;s kid had the same hours as I did. But summer came back and so did my desire to pick up my clothes. Doubtless, Mom would ask for them now that the weather allowed wearing them again. And maybe there was something else that attracted me to that house with a birch tree in…</p>

My parents didn&#039;t think I should be given a car, so usually I preferred riding my bike to school. But since that memorable day, I chose to walk home more often, benefitting from the fact that I could get a lift in the morning by a neighbor working close to my school. I knew my parents didn&#039;t expect me home at a specific time &#039; after all I was old enough to care for myself &#039; and I kept wandering along quiet roads, immersed in memories of &quot;Lady Birch&quot;: In my dreams I had needed a name for her, so I christened her after the tree standing in her front yard.At the same time, Lady Birch had started to feel qualms…</p>

A part of her now wished she had used the toilet before embarking on the weekly grocery shopping.But how urgent would her need to pee become? This morning, she had had quite some milk in her cereal, drank two glasses of fresh garden fruit smoothie &#039; there were just so many fruit in her garden &#039; and later she had slowly sipped through the contents of two bottles of mineral water whilst going about the normal house work.

The guitarist and lead singer of the band she had worshipped practically all her life! In her wildest dreams of becoming a rock star, she had never anticipated THIS. A 5&#039;1&quot;–110 pound, black–haired eighteen year old who had just graduated high school last week was going on tour with her favourite band, TrashFlinger! She HAD to be dreaming. Nissa pinched herself to make sure she was awake before dialling up her band mates to reveal the news. Since Grade 8, Nissa and her best friends had been fans of TrashFlinger, a local punk rock band that had been kicking around for almost ten years now.…</p>

It was by no means the tallest tower in New York City, but definitely one of the city&#039;s finest. It had been constructed over the past two years, 1988 and 1989.The rumour on the street whispered that it had cost Stephen Burns Jr. over twenty million dollars.Glancing at the directory sign, Karen confirmed that she was going to the top floor and hit the elevator button. She took a sip of her large coffee as the elevator arrived. It had been a restless night, with a big day looming. She had finally fallen asleep around 3 am, only to be awakened by her alarm four hours…</p>

She was finally addressing her weight concerns with this three–month program. A 5&quot;9 natural blonde with a busty build, she had been the talk of her high school in her younger years. Now 28 years old and a manager at the local Walmart, she had seen her weight skyrocket nearly twenty pounds in past eighteen months, following a bitter break–up with a boyfriend of three years. Despite the weight gain, she still got plenty of lustful stares from men when she walked around the store.Heather showed her ID to the brunette at the front desk and was directed to Training Room B, down the hall on…</p>

This had led to some incredibly risky lovemaking outside their homes– at the movies, in the quiet corners of the public library, even the bathroom stalls at school. The risk of getting discovered turned them on immensely and they had barely escaped some close calls. Jamie received a phone call from Misty the day after the wetting incident at the bar. Being the experimental type and a closet wetter for many years, Misty was dying for more fun with Jamie and Kiran.

Kathy greeted her with a hug and a quick peck on the lips at the door. Sharon was pleased to see her eyes wander over her body as she invited her in. Kathy led her to the kitchen where a large pot of hot chocolate was brewing. Sharon immediately accepted Kathy&#039;s offer of a hot drink and excitedly watched her…</p>

&quot;What can I do for you?&quot; said Danielle to the seemingly happy young couple sitting in front of her. Having been specialised on sex–related cases directly after University about 10 years ago, the therapist wasn&#039;t used to couples holding hands during the first session. &quot;You don&#039;t seem to be too unhappy with each other!&quot;
&quot;Well&quot;, the boy started, &quot;we do love each other, and we have been together for more than five years now. It is just that our sexual fantasies seem not to match.&quot;
&quot;Now, this is the case with the vast majority of all couples&quot; said the therapist &quot;but it is great to see that you intend to…</p>

There were four of us in the car. I was driving and the only guy. Sitting beside me in the passenger seat was Rosemary, a longtime co–worker and years ago, my girlfriend and lover. In the back seat was Mandy, a cute although a bit overweight blonde prone to sexy outfits and too–tight stretch jeans. Next to her was Geetu, a stunningly beautiful dark complexion India–born woman with raven black hair and flashing dark eyes. She dressed more modestly than Mandy, but her tight jeans clung attractively to her lithe body. All of us worked for Acme Industrial Insurance and were returning home on a Friday afternoon…</p>

Here she was again, outside the apartment bathroom with a morning bladder full to bursting. Inside of course, was her roommate Ashley.
&quot;Ashley! Open the door damn it. You can primp yourself later it&#039;s an emergency.&quot;
&quot;Hold on,&quot; Ashley said.
Geeze, that girl can&#039;t hold it more than 5 minutes before she is pissing all over herself. Ashley thought.
Damn her, damn her, Sam thought to herself again. Ashley did this every morning. Sam tried to wake up before Ashley but sometimes she timed it wrong. What did she do to get stuck with a roommate like her? The pretty girl and the average girl, Sam knew what everyone thought of her and Ashley. Sam herself was not ugly…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Turtle Island, October 1644
With only the feeble starlight, walking on the docks through the mist made Temperance nervous. Her pace kept accelerating, and soon it became even brisker than she thought possible. Cold was sending shivers down her spine but she knew she could not go faster without jeopardizing the poor balance alcohol induced. She passed by a man throwing up every ounce of liquid he had had in the night and her heart missed a beat when she twisted her ankle because of a slippery paving stone. Her squeaking out of surprise and pain was muffled by the mist but not enough. Four blokes she had not spotted at first were coming towards her with small shining blades in their hands, and dark brown rum in…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Sharon had enjoyed her time at North Hill Military Academy, but she was quite glad to return home after six weeks of physically and mentally demanding training. Not only had she learned some valuable life skills, she had also discovered some activities she really enjoyed– rock climbing, paintballing, target shooting, even wetting her pants. The trainers had stressed that the girls were contractually obliged to keep silent about what had taken place over the past six weeks and were not even permitted to talk to each other about the camp once they had left the premises. The organizers of the training had even gone so far to mail the girls&#039; houses, specifically asking their families to refrain from asking…</p>
