        <p class="card-text">Sayuri shifted uncomfortably in the driver&#039;s seat of her Mercury Tracer. She had been sitting there for more than two hours: Her butt was numb; the backs of her thighs ached, and her bladder was almost bursting. She reflected ruefully that they never showed this aspect of a stakeout in the movies. Male detectives either had cast–iron bladders, or they would simply step out of the car and pee in the gutter. For a woman, that wasn&#039;t an option, especially not on a street bordered on one side by a high wall and on the other by a residential estate. She adjusted herself in her seat, flicking her long, black, slightly curly hair over her shoulders, and wondered how much longer she would have to sit there before her…</p>

        <p class="card-text">The sunlight shone in from the east, filtering through the white curtains, casting patterns upon the hardwood floor of the upstairs bedroom. The window was open, the cool morning breeze wafting gently throughout the room, birds chirping as the new day began. Next to the window, to the left, stood a cabinet, filled with picture frames and mementos. On top of the cabinet sat an old alarm clock, manual wind, a worn cell phone, and a hairbrush. A few bobby pins lay next to the hairbrush, along with a torn piece of paper with a phone number on it. To the right of the window there was open space; only a faded picture of an old Elle magazine cover hung sloppily in a cheap frame. Within the wall to the right of the…</p>

I was shopping at the local supermarket and was packing the goods as they came through the checkout. It was quite a busy time and there was a long queue at each till. When the last items came through, I packed them up and turned to pay the cashier. As I handed over the money I heard someone say &quot;Noooo&quot; in a shrill anguished voice. I looked, and the next lady in line had her hands firmly jammed in her crotch and was doing a frantic pee–pee dance. As I collected my change she seemed to get herself under control. I turned to her and said that I sympathized with her predicament and asked her whether I could help…</p>

        <p class="card-text">In all my life I had never known anyone who was remotely as androgynous as Terri. Everything about her was just totally ambiguous, and I continued to harbour some residual doubts as to her true sex right up to the moment she began to wet herself. And even then, it was only the obviously &quot;female&quot; pattern of the wet spot spreading across the front of her jeans from a point slightly below the bottom of her zipper which finally convinced me that she had to be a girl, even though the visible fastenings on her clothes all did up on the &quot;boys&#039; side.&quot;
She boarded my train at Mile End. I had traveled in from Loughton, so naturally I had a seat. By Mile End, however, the train was becoming crowded and several people…</p>

Sally was a highly attractive 18–year–old working in a fast food restaurant in the north of England. She attracted attention from all the boys, but had a steady boyfriend, Dave, who was a manager at the restaurant. Tonight it was an awards night and about 20 people from Sally&#039;s restaurant were attending. The company was organizing a coach to take them to the nightclub and drop them off again afterwards. It was going to be great.

        <p class="card-text">20–year–old Tiffany was late for class again. She knew that her professor was going to be very upset with her for being late again and would probably fail her on the lab that she was late for. She brushed her brunette hair that fell to her shoulders, wishing that she had a roommate to wake her up. She hated living by herself. Looking in the mirror she noticed she was standing there in nothing but a white pair of bikini panties and a white bra. She quickly slipped on a pink skirt with a matching belt and pulled on thigh high tan stockings. She threw on a white halter–top, slipped on shoes, gulped down a cup of coffee, and ran out the door. She started running to class when she realized that she had forgotten…</p>

When she woke up, her long brunette hair was all in clumps, and when she went to get out of bed her pajamas caught on the bed post and ripped right at the crotch.

She quickly stepped in the shower and washed her hair, but it was still hard to brush when she came out.

My super pee marathon encouraged her to try a normal pee marathon and go 26.2 hours without a pee. I was out of town at the time, but Jessica recounted the entire experience for me:
Well I knew I usually had to pee worst in the morning, so I decided on a three–day weekend I would get up at 7:55 AM on Sunday and go for my morning pee.

        <p class="card-text">Any of you who work in construction will know that, occasionally, a zip–tight bladder is pretty much essential. Whilst I was at university (on my year placement) I really learned the hard way! It wasn&#039;t the first time I&#039;d wet my knickers – either in public or privately ;–) – but doing it at work was never top of my list!
I was working with a firm of architects and was asked to go and do some survey drawings at an English cathedral. This involved going up into the roof space and then climbing down onto scaffolding about 25 meters above–ground on the outside of the building. I love this kind of stuff about my job and was really chuffed when the practice manager said I could handle the work myself.
I drove up…</p>

She arched her back to stretch and she tilted her head back, her long straight blond hair flowing straight down, shimmering in the remaining rays of late afternoon sunlight that shone through the large plate glass windows of the indoor pool. She looked like the letter &quot;C,&quot; her athletic body arched as she paused in the position, working the kinks out of her back after sitting for so long. Her red official lifeguard one piece bathing suit fit tightly against her slightly tanned body, her toned abs taut underneath the red fabric, her legs…</p>

        <p class="card-text">In my school days, when I was young I can remember an amazing desperation accident by one of my schoolteachers. I will not mention the school and I will call her Ms. Shirley C_ to keep her name secret. Ms. C_ was in her mid twenties when this event happened and looking back at old class photos now, she was extremely attractive.
Ms. C_ always wore nice flowing knee high hemmed skirts and when we were all sitting on the classroom mat she would squat down in front of us to talk.
This would always get the attention of all the boys, myself included, because Ms. C_ would sometimes forget to tuck her skirt behind her knees and we would get a free peepshow of her underwear. After that we were left talking about what…</p>

        <p class="card-text">You know how there are people out to get you, even when you haven&#039;t done anything to them? That was what it was like for Clara Birks. It was her first year in the sorority, and she wanted to make a good impression on the girls. Clara was about 5&#039;5, 105 lbs, with brown hair and brown eyes. She was merely average. So why did Amanda Poole hate her so much? Some think it was because when attending the initiation, Amanda wet herself in fear, and mistook Clara&#039;s laughter at her friends for laughter at Amanda&#039;s embarrassing accident. Who knows, but after that night, Amanda had regained her dignity by cliquing up in her rich circle of friends. Amanda soon became the ringleader of the popular crowd of 5.

21–year–old woke up one morning and tossed off her sheets, which were slightly damp. She reached down and felt the bottom of her light blue cotton thong, which was fairly dry, but still a little damp. She cursed her small bladder and got out of bed, her long blonde hair flowing down to just above her tight little ass. She shook out of her panties, letting them drop the floor, and ripped the sheets off the bed, moving to the kitchen and putting them in the washer. She noticed the time was 8:50 and wanted to leave at 9 for her shopping, so she ran back into her room and threw open her drawer, grabbing a pair of pink cotton bikini panties, pulling them over her long legs and covering her delicate bush.…</p>
