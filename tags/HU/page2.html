        <p class="card-text">Sharon&#039;s semester had gone as well as she could have possibly expected. She was doing well in all her second year classes and had good grades going into her final exams. Her Psychology 241 class was by far the most interesting course she had ever taken. She had her first ever sexual experience with Kathy, her professor, but it seemed like a one–time deal. Sharon had stayed behind after class a number of times; approaching her professor after all the other students had left. Last week, she had even gone to her during office hours with several questions, seductively dressed in a skimpy workout shirt and tight shorts in obvious desperation after a bottle of water and two beers, but hadn&#039;t gotten any response from…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Sharon felt a mix of anxiety, anticipation, and excitement as she lay awake in the lower half of the bunk bed. Her watch told her that it was 6:56, just a few minutes from her wake–up call and the start of her first day of cadet training at North Hill Military Academy. She had just checked in last night after a 4 hour bus ride from her hometown, where she had lived all her life. She was pretty excited to be away from her parents for the first time in her 18 years, having just finished her first year of Psychology at Fairmont College, a twenty minute drive from her house.

        <p class="card-text">I have been reading this site for a while now, and to be completely honest, it both reassures me and turns me on that other people get into these situations too! I&#039;ve been having these sorts of problems (and accidents) for as long as I can remember, and my friends and family just don&#039;t seem to get it. I guess I have a small bladder (much smaller than anyone else), and so need to pee a lot.
As I&#039;ve been reading and reading these stories, thought it was about time to give something back. I&#039;m no writer though, so instead of writing long, in–depth stories, I&#039;ve put together a few of my different memories. Trust me, there&#039;s too many to count!

Her body drew looks everywhere she went, with her thin waist and swaying hips, she hypnotized everyone without even trying. Her eyes were bright green and her hair was beautiful strawberry blonde, down to her shoulders. She was currently a student who held a job, working as many hours as she could while still getting straight–A&#039;s. Her job was a stressful one – she worked all day doing paper work and taking, often long, phone calls for the very large, very important real estate agent she worked for.

And after four years of college she wanted nothing more to work as a T.V reporter, and this was finally her chance to get into the business. She thought she had an edge up over some of the hundreds of other girls that always wanted the job because of her looks. She was really striking; 5&#039;6, 125 lbs, very full, slightly curly light brown that flowed past her shoulders, slightly pale but it suited her. And a body to match with a very cute full butt, but still very firm and trim and perky B cup breasts. So, Claire got ready for bed by putting on a soft light blue tight t–shirt…</p>

Mandy&#039;s life had changed dramatically in the past 2 months. Her boyfriend, Doug had recently asked her to move in with him and she had happily accepted. Doug&#039;s client base was growing rapidly and the law firm had gotten very busy. With the busier workdays, there had not been as much time for wet fun at work. It had gotten so busy that Doug had to hire a junior lawyer to help him keep up with the workload.
Mandy had been forced to make adjustments as well. Last month, Doug had told her he would have to hire a secretary more experienced in the law field, because of the huge call back list of clients he…</p>

We were playing in the semi–final game Saturday, and if we won, were playing in the state finals on Sunday. We headed up to Denver after school on Friday, because our coach didn&#039;t want us to play after a 2–hour bus ride. Unfortunately, the school was only planning to pay for Saturday night and all the girls had to share beds because we could only get half the rooms. I was rooming with three other senior girls. Kelly was a starter, like me, while Alyssa and Kira were backups. Though this was not a big deal, Alyssa played the same position as me and made it clear she thought she should be the starter.

Mandy had an unusual relationship with her boss and lover, Doug. Outside of work, he was everything she could ask for in a man; he was kind, passionate, and extremely fun to be with. However, the situation was a little different at work. He had requested that their relationship should be kept a secret for now, because it looked unprofessional and he was fearful of getting of being perceived as someone who took advantage of women who worked for him. He asked her to continue to address him as Mr. Welsh at work and not to show any public displays of affection at the office. He promised her that he would tell…</p>

In spite of the fact that she was almost twenty years older than me we became good friends and shared a lot of interests. She cared a lot about her appearance, always dressed in stylish clothes, suits with trousers or skirts and looked much younger.

        <p class="card-text">My name is Rahab. It&#039;s a Biblical name, but most people call me Rae. I had a very sheltered upbringing; my father was the vicar of Causton, a small English country town in Midsomershire.
Within his limits Dad was a good father. He made me work hard at school, he encouraged me to read widely, and he was always very patient answering my questions. But it was all in the world of the mind. The fact that his darling daughter had a bladder, bowels and a womb was something he could not really get his head round.
So the bodily aspects of my upbringing were all left to Mum. Sex was dealt with quite simply; it could be summed up in one sentence: &quot;Wait till you&#039;re married.&quot; Sometimes I seemed to pick up the implication…</p>

Mandy looked at her reflection in the mirror for the umpteenth time that morning. She had to make sure that she looked perfect. It was an important day for her– she had to make sure she looked as attractive as possible. She was dressed in a tight white t–shirt with no bra, showing off her perfectly round breasts and erect nipples. She wore a tight denim skirt, short enough to reveal her light pink cotton panties when she bent over. She wished she was brave enough to wear her favourite pair of skinny jeans, but couldn&#039;t bring herself to risk the consequences of that just yet.
Mandy had been preparing for…</p>

        <p class="card-text">It was finally that day, a cloudy Saturday morning that my worst nightmare came about. Well, I had to visit my relatives in another city and I hate throwing my precious time off the cliff doing some pointless stuff. However I had no idea, they would probably say that I had forgotten them or I had abandoned our very good relationship if I were to deny this invitation, not to mention that it was holiday. Honestly, I&#039;d rather slack at home for some sexy omorashi videos.
Before long, I reached the airport earlier than expected; I was anticipating a rain that might cause a traffic jam to occur at first, though the cloudy sky remained calm. I bought a Fillet O&#039; Fish from McDonald&#039;s and began eating mindlessly.…</p>

        <p class="card-text">The Seattle city center traffic was so bad that it was often joked that it caused people to become junkies and then kill themselves. It made sense as the city was famously known for being the center of the early 90’s grunge scene, a short–lived but significant era in rock music, with bands such as Nirvana, Alice in Chains, Pearl Jam, and Soundgarden. Two of the more influential grunge bands, Nirvana and Alice in Chains abruptly ended following the suicides of their lead singers in the mid 90’s.
Mandy, currently stuck in the same afternoon Seattle traffic, sighed deeply as her frustration mounted behind the wheel of her 2004 Volkswagen Golf. She was on her way home from work, a commute that was no more than 20…</p>

Ever since my last accident, I&#039;d been thinking on how to best go about my next wetting. Every idea just seemed too bold for me. I liked what I felt to a certain extent, but most of my initial ideas would potentially put me in very socially dangerous situations. I kept arguing with myself in that regard, because it is entirely the point to feel that danger. The simple release is nothing without thought of losing it, the fear of utter humiliation.
That&#039;s when I came up with my plan. I wanted to pee in front of someone but have it not matter. I wanted to experience the urgency of a consequence to flooding my pants.…</p>
