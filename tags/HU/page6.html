Her wrists were tied behind her, fastened to her ankles. There was a rope around her knees, pulling them apart, and she was slightly suspended from above, where ropes under her arms held her up. Her body was arched back, pushing out her breasts, and her legs were apart enough that Thy knew the men would be looking at her pussy.
Occasionally she heard murmurs from behind the glass, and caught a word of English here and there. Thy was Japanese, and was in the country on a student exchange program…</p>

        <p class="card-text">As shopping sprees went, it hadn&#039;t been a particularly good one. Sarah had found little to interest her, and wished now that she had done something different with her Saturday. True, she had found a few small items of lingerie in J. C. Penny, but not much else. She had consoled herself with lunch at an eatery on the top floor of the mall calling itself the Cottage Garden. It was pretentious and overpriced, but she did enjoy the lasagne and Caesar salad, accompanied by what the proprietors claimed was tea made the proper English way, Earl Grey in a large white tea pot, all to herself.
The highlight of the lunch had been when a handsome guy had asked to share her table. They had chatted, and Sarah had crossed…</p>

He&#039;d had a big breakfast and didn&#039;t get the chance to relieve himself before coming to class like he normally does, so he was getting rather uncomfortable by the end of Professor Johnson&#039;s lecture.
A crowd of students began milling around the professor to ask him about the day&#039;s notes, but Chris was lucky enough to push out of the classroom before they started blocking the door. He…</p>

She moaned loudly, sounding like a wounded cat as she did so. Another bead of sweat rolled down her forehead, her bare legs clenched together, tightly, tensed, her pulse quickening, breathing rapid, eyes dilated, face twisted. Her left hand waved through dark brunette hair, tied up in a single ponytail that flopped against her back and then rapidly grasped her thigh, finger–nails biting clutching her skin. Her body twitched, she shivered. Goose bumps rose on her bare legs, the cool air chilling her. She struggled again, breath held tight, eyes widening as the pressure came again. Stinging. Pulsing.

Mrs. Hauser was my PE coach in college. She was known for being a real bitch, and for having an incredible ass that she always showed off in tight jeans and skin–tight sweat pants. She developed the bitch reputation for not allowing people to leave to use the restroom in her class.
Inevitably, once or twice a year, she&#039;d make some poor freshman wet their pants in front of the entire class without fail. She seemed to get some type of sadistic pleasure out of watching you squirm until you flooded the pants you were wearing. She was especially mean to the guys, as I unfortunately found out my senior year in college.

        <p class="card-text">Laura, an ambitious young woman, had decided to expand her skills by taking night classes at her local college to obtain a diploma in business studies, a qualification which would enable her to go after a more demanding and better–paid job than the tedious office assistant style stuff she was doing at present. Night classes took their toll, however. Starting at six p.m., she had very little time to get across town from work and rarely arrived in the classroom on time. She hated being late, and besides, her repeated late arrivals were beginning to irritate her tutor, Dr. Edwin White.

I made a visit to Wendovers, a new clothing shop in the High Street to buy some new shirts. While I searched the racks for shirts in my size, and in my style, I overheard a conversation going on between two of the shop assistants. As I began to listen, my ears literally pricked up.
I had already noticed the Chinese girl when I came in. She was slim with long black hair, and dressed in typical working attire –– black heels, black pencil skirt and a white short–sleeved blouse. She was standing in an enclosed area where the tills were located, along with an older woman with a repellent perm and frumpy clothes.

        <p class="card-text">School was going by so slow. Well, that&#039;s what 18–year–old Nicole thought anyways, sitting in her high school chemistry class. Nicole was a dream girl...shoulder length brunette hair that she always had in some sexy position and never wore the wrong way. Always wearing her short skirts with her stockings and high heels...and of course, today, she was wearing one as well. A short pink skirt that definitely wasn&#039;t school dress code length, but she managed to keep her fingertips above it and black stockings that ran right up to under the end of her skirt with her black high heels that just went past her ankle. And her cute little top that was way too tight and showed off her 32 C breasts nicely. All the guys…</p>

        <p class="card-text">I first saw her as I was walking along the main concourse at Kennedy Airport, looking for the departure gate for the American Airlines flight to San Francisco. She was perched up on one of the metal railings, shoes off and peering down at her feet. A slim blonde, probably in her mid–twenties, I could not help but admire how apt was her appearance– I&#039;d already recognized her flight attendant uniform as belonging to the Scandinavian Airlines (or SAS) stable. She was simply very cute, and as hard as I tried not to stare at her as passed, I just couldn&#039;t help myself.
She glanced up and caught me looking, but instead of quickly avoiding my gaze the way most western women would do, she smiled. It was an electric…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Jenny said &quot;goodbye&quot; to her last client of the day, and hitched her bag up onto her shoulder as old Mrs. Finch closed the front door behind her. The sun beat down on her, and a heat haze rose from the pavement. A gentle breeze took the edge off the heat, but it was still easily the hottest day of the year so far. She felt thirsty, and wished she could take a long, refreshing swig from the bottle of water at the bottom of her bag; but she dared not. She was already feeling the first faint urges of the need for a pee, and there was nowhere that she could stop to use the toilet on the long walk across town to her old friend Samantha&#039;s house. Sure she&#039;d be able to use the toilet when she got to Sam&#039;s; but she didn…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Sharon handed her ticket to the uniformed steward who was standing on the platform beside the open door to carriage E of the Inverness Sleeper. He studied it for a moment or two and made a tick on a piece of paper on his clip board, then handed the ticket back to Sharon.
&quot;Turn right,&quot; he said in an indifferent, couldn&#039;t–care–less tone of voice. &quot;Third compartment. Your room mate&#039;s already aboard.&quot;
Sharon wasn&#039;t altogether happy with the idea of sharing a sleeping compartment with a total stranger, but that was the deal if you could only afford a standard class fare. First class passengers got a sleeping compartment to themselves; but first class fares were way beyond Sharon&#039;s means. So she hefted her…</p>
