Tanja and I were together in Mexico. It still seemed so surreal even as I lay beside her in bed that first morning in a five star beachside resort. It was already getting quite warm even though it couldn&#039;t have been past 9:30. I considered getting up to turn on the AC before it got too hot, but didn&#039;t want to leave the comfortable bed just yet. Tanja was still sleeping beside me, completely nude. 
It had been a long but fun night. We had gotten drunk back in L.A., but not drunk enough to be restricted from flying. We had taken a cab to the airport, already desperate from the alcohol we had consumed. We…</p>

The first seven weeks of my new job flew by. I was really busy with work, learning many of my tasks on the fly. I was glad that I had paid attention in school; I knew the basics of my job very well. However, there were still many aspects of my job that had been taught lightly or not at all. I worked hard to learn the ropes of the trade and complete my tasks as quickly and effectively as I could. My boss, Mr. Brokovich had been pleased with how well I was picking up things, but it was really all Tanja&#039;s doing. She was a great mentor, both in accounting–related matters and in love.
Before I knew it, it was Friday…</p>

Things were going well between Tanja and me. I was madly in love with her and I could feel that she had a growing liking to me as well. We did have our differences though. I wanted nothing more than to be with Tanja all the time. She was absolutely amazing in every way. She was the woman I had only seen in my dreams until now.
However, Tanja was more non–committal and tended to shy away from any discussions of getting to know each other better. She seemed to want to keep her options open and rolled with life as it came, taking in all of each and every experience. I had told her that I was okay with…</p>

So here goes....
I&#039;m Katy, I live in Cornwall, I&#039;m about five and a half feet tall with shoulder length dark hair, and people often say I look a bit like Posh Spice.
I turned 19 a couple of weeks ago and as an extra special treat for my birthday my mum took me to New York on a shopping spree (I&#039;m so spoilt!!)
On the morning of the trip I had a couple of coffees and a bowl of cornflakes with lots of milk –yum!
We set off in good time to get to Heathrow, I was sipping my water bottle as we made our way up the M4 when suddenly near the Chippenham junction the traffic ground to a halt,…</p>

My new job has kept me very busy to say the least. I begin work at 9:00 am each morning and quit at 5:00 pm. There is usually a few hours of work left over that I complete at home for clients coming in the next morning. Despite the big workload, I am enjoying my job. A big reason for this is the money. It is nice to be able to eat real meals after living on Kraft Dinner for the past six years. I am even considering moving out of my rented apartment and buying a place within the next year, a big step for someone just a few months out of university.
Without a doubt, the best part of my job is Tanja. I fell in love…</p>

She was sitting on the bus on the way to the trail with her friend Sara. &quot;I know– that&#039;s why I brought this!&quot; Sara exclaimed, pulling a half–full water bottle out of her bag. &quot;What? Water?&quot; Kelly asked. &quot;Vodka,&quot; Sara said. &quot;I only snagged enough from my parents to give us a good buzz, we don&#039;t want to get hammered on a class trip.&quot; &quot;Awesome!&quot; Kelly exclaimed. &quot;Hey, got enough to share?&quot; asked their friend Kim from the seat behind them. &quot;I suppose,&quot; Sara sighed.
Ten minutes later, the bus arrived at the trail. &quot;If anyone needs to go to the bathroom, there&#039;s an outhouse over there,&quot; announced…</p>

        <p class="card-text">I am writing about my experiences with a very special woman that I felt very fortunate to meet even if it was for a limited time. It all started with my new job at an advisory and management accounting firm in Los Angeles. I had just graduated from university at the age of 23 and was a little inexperienced in the relationship department. I had never had a girlfriend or even a high school sweetheart. All my sexual experiences had come from binge–drinking campus parties and one–night stands. Admittedly, I was glad to get out of the college life and into the real world, where was I hoping to find a more meaningful relationship that I had not found up to this point.

I really enjoy if that happens to other young women, but after that one accident I have not seen that kind of wetting event. Close situations many times (club lines and taxi lines in the night for example), but not really wetting accidents. I never thought I could accidentally pee my pants myself.

Going on holiday to Cyprus was supposed to be so much fun! My friends, Alice and Barbara had talked me into the idea, but I had my doubts from the start.
&quot;Come on Janice, why don&#039;t you join us on holiday before we all go off to university! It will be great – promise you!&quot;
The first day was quite nice, exploring the coast, and lazing in the warm sun, but I found the evening hell! To be honest, I guess I was just not very good at mixing with people, and I really couldn&#039;t bear the idea of getting disgustingly drunk!

        <p class="card-text">Trisha was really cute but not innocent, she was also quite adventurous, mostly when it came to clothes. She drove the staff nuts at our school, skirts too short, shirts too little, bra less, but even so she had a way of not looking like a slut or a hooker. This had a lot to do with the fact that she wasn&#039;t either of those things but there was something about her. She was just a regular girl who wore what she wanted. The teachers, male and female, tried everything; sending her home to change and she would come back in a different crazy outfit, making her wear the school uniform, she would just cut it short. 
Even though she was 18 and a senior the staff felt that she shouldn&#039;t wear such things in high school.…</p>

Val was fashion modelling, and now helps run an agency. When she first came over here from Italy, she worked in an antiques shop in between assignments. I met her there when I was a student and we got on pretty well. As she was new in England I helped her out with quite a few things. After six months she even had to move in with me, as she had got herself involved with a really dodgy landlord and didn&#039;t feel safe.
We were just friends at this stage, but any bloke would have wanted more, and I was happy to work my way slowly into her affections. Then as luck would have it, two bombshells landed in quick succession.…</p>

When I got home after college Eve and Ann were waiting for me in the living room. They had put a blanket on the floor and told me I had to stand on it while I peed my jeans. I felt so turned on. I had just come home, with my coat and backpack still on and I could wet my pants now. I didn&#039;t hesitate, without taking anything off I stepped on the blanket and slightly spread my legs. Ann said something like, &#039;Oh my God, she is going to do it completely dressed, with even her backpack on,&#039; and then I relaxed. I felt it coming soon enough. It erupted against my panties, making it jet back at…</p>

Maria Zellar is a thin girl, very geeky, but also quite attractive at the age of eighteen. Her dark, brown hair contrasts her pale skin very nicely, and her glasses compliment her face. She also has very large breasts for someone so thin.
Today Maria&#039;s senior class was on a field trip to the Natural History Museum. Her class had arrived in town at around 11:00am, and it was now 3:50. It was nearing time to leave, but Maria didn&#039;t even notice because she was so enthralled by the exhibits. She had been walking around a lot today, visiting all the shops in town and touring the museum, and so she had been drinking lots of water to…</p>

At work we have a strict policy. You can surf and mail work related and mail privately as well if it doesn&#039;t take up to much work time. Porn is strictly forbidden. As head of the IT department I had to check this from time to time. All Internet pages visited were logged on both who visited and how long they stayed if they were not in the approved list. I checked the log twice a week and if a site was clearly work related I added it to the list immediately. If it was on the edge of work related but not in violation of work codes (porn) I added it to a second list where the maximum visit…</p>

        <p class="card-text">As the three women were lying in the sun after their lunch, a girl came riding along on her bicycle. With her long, shiny hair, her slender and athletic but well–rounded figure, and her –as usual – fashionable style of dress she was the siren boys might die for. She was living in the next village and not especially fond of Marianne, although she knew the girl liked her. At present, she was disappointed to see the group of women here, where she had thought to take a quick pee break in the bunker. She knew about the vagabond living there and as she did not like vagabonds she wanted to annoy him by peeing into his treasured home. She was relieved to see the three women were almost asleep and as it seemed, naked.…</p>
