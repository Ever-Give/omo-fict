        <p class="card-text">I&#039;d like to say up front that I am an ancient male who loves sightings and stories of females accidentally wetting themselves. However, such incidents have necessarily had to be incidents of pure accident in order to arouse me. I have never thought I would be aroused by purposeful wetting accidents on the part of females. But then, I never considered it possible that a female would wet herself on purpose.
Male wettings whether accidental or not has never entered my mind as a means of sexual arousal, only as a matter of curiosity. 
As an ancient male I have had occasion to witness many female struggles with full bladders and I have witnessed many females who have lost those struggles. Although not nearly as…</p>

        <p class="card-text">The urge had come upon her quite suddenly. No gradual feeling of fullness in her bladder, she seemed to go from not wanting to pee to being bloody desperate in a matter of minutes.
This was not good. All she had on either side of her were tall hedges. Occasionally there was a gate that led to a field, but now that she wanted one there wasn&#039;t a gate to be seen. As she walked, so the feeling in her bladder became more acute. It was obvious to her that unless she could get into a field pretty soon she was going to have to empty her bladder on the path.
The trouble with that was that the lane was pretty twisty which meant that anyone could come around a corner at any moment. The thought that someone would…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Lucy and Jayne were walking home from work past the fountain in the town square when a teenage girl sat on the side of the fountain and overbalanced– to fall backwards into the water in front of several hundred people who were gathered around enjoying their lunch break or just relaxing.
When the girl emerged from her soaking she looked as embarrassed as hell, her face red and obviously quite close to tears. The two friends watched her step out of the water, her jeans and blue t–shirt clinging and shining on her body, water pouring off of them. Some well meaning people fussed around her, but it was obvious that all she wanted to do was get the hell away from the spotlight.

The girl smiles and walks across to the car, and I&#039;m struck by this look she has– all bright and shiny, like the sunlight&#039;s just streaming straight through her. She&#039;s maybe twenty, twenty–one, not too tall, not too blonde, and with enough showing below the line of her little yellow top to tell me she must exercise her belly every day to keep it that shape. &#039;Are you going anywhere near Brinwell?&#039; she asks, and I give Howie a look that tells him we are…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Mia Stevens got out of her white Kia Reo, the only car she could afford when her college costs were considered, and knew that she was more than a little nervous. It was late evening on a cool September night; the sun&#039;s final blood red rays were streaming through the leaves of a nearby tree. She pulled her blue jean jacket closer around her body to fend off the wind and started up the sidewalk towards the pale green house. At the age of nineteen, Mia was a beautiful girl. She had very long, curly black hair that was pulled back into a ponytail. Her curves were perfect and well defined and her face held the very essence of beauty. She was wearing a white sweater and light, faded blue jeans, just as she had been…</p>

In 1962 I was in a position as a peon who manned the coffee bar at my squadron operations facility. In this role I was privy to many pilots&#039; conversations.
There was one conversation that was particularly interesting, as you will see. My squadron was one of fighter interceptor aircraft in the New York/Washington D. C. air defense sectors. These fighter interceptors were two–seater, two engine aircraft capable of mach one speeds with a cruising range of 1500 miles. However, for the purposes of this story they normally cruised at less than mach one for less than 1500 miles.…</p>

Nancy&#039;s wetting accident on the city bus was merely a dream, a dream that coincided with her wetting her bed after a night of beer drinking.

Jackie and I had left for home after an early morning breakfast that included a lot of coffee and juice. We choose to go west for spring break instead of the typical Florida or Padre Island thing that most college kids choose, as we both loved the desert and had friends in Palm Springs. As we drove along that stretch of deserted blacktop, listening to music on the radio, we talked and kept drinking away at a cooler of cokes that we had purchased.

        <p class="card-text">MaryBeth Pickman did little to hide her annoyance when her mother told her that the family was going to the zoo for her little brother Joey&#039;s birthday. She was, after all, eighteen years old, an adult and far too old to be going to the zoo with a small child. But, her mother had used the famous &quot;as long as you&#039;re living under my roof, you&#039;re living under my rules, and I say you are coming,&quot; and MaryBeth was forced to go. She was more than a little upset, thinking it unfair for her mother to say that to her, but she had little choice and that Friday found herself riding next to an overly excited Joey who did little more than talk about how much he wanted to see a real live elephant.
With a fall of full, soft…</p>

        <p class="card-text">It was 11:45 and Nancy had just finished her filing. That was a normal duty and what came later was her notion of simply completing the job. She realized she had a full bladder and she was squirming somewhat in her tight gray gabardine skirt as she worked. Not to worry as she would be finished in a few minutes and would be free to go to the bathroom on the way home. 
It was a fine Saturday morning in 1957 that Nancy found herself working. The building was open and therefore the office was open. She wanted to impress her boss with her sense of duty. Most of what she was doing could have been put off until Monday but there were two reports her boss had asked her to do that were outside the domain of her job…</p>

        <p class="card-text">The night had been fun, for sure. Driving along the dark road back to their hometown, the two seniors were giddy with excitement. The Senior Night their high school had thrown for them was pretty cool, especially considering that it was the principal&#039;s idea. Surely his teenage son planned it, they had thought, laughing.
Of course, the principal didn&#039;t know that over half of the seniors had snuck in alcohol, sneaking drinks in the bathrooms or out by their cars when the chaperones weren&#039;t looking. There wasn&#039;t going to be any alcohol in this car though, Amber thought, as she drove home, still with a slight buzz on. She couldn&#039;t believer her Dad let her take HIS car, his prized Mercedes, out on the town for one…</p>

        <p class="card-text">I&#039;ve been into peeing since I was a teenager, and I did a lot of stuff in the privacy of my bedroom when I was in high school. I had a few close calls during junior high and high school, where I leaked a little into my panties, but nothing that anyone noticed. One of my most memorable experiences happened in college. I went to a small private school that was out in the middle of nowhere. During my junior year, I took summer classes so I could graduate one semester early. One Saturday in late July, one of the student groups organized a day trip to an amusement park that was about 150 miles away. They chartered a bus, and we left at 9:00 o&#039;clock in the morning. The bus was very comfortable, with air conditioning…</p>
