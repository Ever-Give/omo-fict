Michaela jolted up in bed as her deafening alarm clock started to beep. She quickly silenced the alarm and rubbed her eyes, it was a little past 4 pm and she was supposed to meet her roommate Alyssa for a late lunch down the street. The two girls worked together as bartenders at a trendy nightclub nearby. Michaela didn&#039;t get home until 6 am that morning but tonight was the beginning of their weekend and she intended to put it to good use. Michaela crawled out from under the covers revealing her smooth tan legs, She was about 5&#039;&quot;7&quot; and weighed around 108. She ran her fingers through her shoulder length…</p>

        <p class="card-text">I&#039;ve told the story (Patience and Prudence: An Introduction) of how my twin sister Prudence and I acquired such different toilet habits. After a wetting accident in the car, Prue became neurotic about taking precautions if she was going to be out of the range of a toilet, while I, after a very painful evening out with my boyfriend, had discovered that I had very good control and had decided not to take precautions at all.
As time went on, Prue and I noticed our different attitudes and we often used to joke about it. I would say that if Prue was going to the shop across the street for some milk she&#039;d run up to the toilet first &quot;just in case&quot; she got caught short in the middle of the road. On the other hand if…</p>

Laura was sitting in the folding chair, filming Gillian as she was holding Marianne and felt her body quiver with lust and expectation, but also with the urgent need to pee. They had been hiking almost two hours now, and the nice pee break behind the picturesque chapel had been before they started. Laura felt the three litres of water she had drunk in the meantime filling her bladder to full capacity. She was on the verge of letting go; she wanted to pee right in the chair she sat in. Thinking about this she realized Marianne could look right up her crotch since she wasn&#039;t…</p>

        <p class="card-text">I met Emily at a trade–union meeting connected to the company we both worked for. I really liked her and I asked her out to dinner. We went to a very nice restaurant I knew in central London, not too expensive but excellent food. We got on really well; we were clearly on the same wavelength. I had great hopes this might go further.
As we were preparing to pay the bill, Emily looked at me and said: &quot;Shall I go to the Ladies&#039; here, or hang on till I get home?&quot; I was rather taken aback; I wasn&#039;t used to young women asking such intimate questions. Rather facetiously I mumbled something about not having the necessary information to give an answer.
Emily smiled; there was a twinkle in her eye that showed she could…</p>

Unfortunately for her she was stuck in a massive traffic jam with her boyfriend and wasn&#039;t going anywhere for a while.

Another two cups as she went about her morning tasks, a pint of water to hydrate before her morning run and another one as she got back. Just before setting out she had gone to the loo but hadn&#039;t peed much. Now, two hours out of the house and caught in the worse traffic jam she had ever seen she gritted her…</p>

Now that she&#039;d had time to think things over, I felt sure she would decide to tender her resignation and move on, rather than having to face the awkwardness of working alongside me.
It had been good while it lasted, I told myself. She had asked for a shot at the job, despite the difficulties created by the lack of female facilities, but things had gone hopelessly wrong on her very first day. I didn&#039;t see how she could deal with the embarrassment.…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Barbara had managed to get herself into a situation that she had promised to never do again. She had wound up in the third period class in a desperate need to go to the bathroom.
At her school any request to leave the classroom was to be refused so Barbara was left to squirm and fidget throughout the class in the hope she could hold her water until the end of the class. Squirm and fidget she did telegraphing to all her nearby classmates the cause of her distress. Barbara had to pee very badly and her friends knew it.
Barbara was wearing a light blue, denim knee–length straight skirt. I mention all this because Barbara was completely unable to hold herself due to the tightness of her skirt. When Barbara got…</p>

        <p class="card-text">It was Saturday morning, and Sarah had slept late. She awoke with a fierce, burning need to pee. Simon was already up, and she glanced at the bedside clock. 10:00 a.m. Then she jumped out of bed and ran to the bathroom, where she immediately dropped her pyjamas around her feet and sat on the toilet. As a powerful, apparently never–ending torrent gushed out from between her legs; she began to do some mental arithmetic. Since she had been living with Simon, she had abandoned her habit of taking a leak before going to bed. She slept like a log, especially after good sex, and never awoke till she was absolutely bursting. On this occasion, she calculated, it was a good fourteen hours since her last visit to the…</p>

Since her empathic abilities had developed she sensed she was destined to meet her soul mate, the women she would join with for life, but it never happened. Then she started working for the Paltathion Ministry of Education, only to be arrested for murder. And then she had believed she could postpone her execution indefinitely by giving herself to Cota, but now even that had failed.
Gabri–Ann sensed the jailers were coming with a new prisoner, and she combed her short blond hair and straightened her robe before they entered. The new prisoner was wearing an officer&#039;s uniform of the Imperial…</p>

        <p class="card-text">My First (and best ever) Experience
My name is Julia. Though I&#039;m still in high school, since I&#039;m now 18, I feel liberated, in that now I can share my experiences with others. This story is about my first experience, when I first learned that peeing and watching others pee was such a turn–on for me.
Though I like boys, I like peeing with other girls more than anything else in the world, and in that aspect, I guess I&#039;m somewhat of a bisexual. This story is told in the third person. I chose to write it this way so that I could include every event that took place, since I wasn&#039;t in the same room as some of the other girls when they peed.
Chloe, Claire, Julia, Ashley and Dani were all going over to Eliza&#039;s house…</p>

        <p class="card-text">As I mentioned previously, my original story was based on true events but not quite. What is true is that I am twenty and The Diet really has taken off at my office causing some pretty interesting events – well it&#039;s of interest to me anyway. While I am heterosexual something about seeing someone (regardless of gender) desperate to pee makes me crazy.
Anyway, at the office there is this girl Hannah who is very pretty but not exactly a rocket scientist and is kind of full of herself. The truth is that I doubt we&#039;d talk if we didn&#039;t go to the same gym. She came over to me the other week and casually asked me if I thought The Diet made me better at holding it. I replied that yeah, of course it did since it makes…</p>
