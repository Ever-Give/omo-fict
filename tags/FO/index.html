        <p class="card-text">The next few days went by rather uneventfully. Neither Carol nor I wanted to make a mistake in our relationship, so we were very, very cautious. In fact, aside from the fact that we continued to sleep in the same bed, our relationship went back to what it had been in the past. I had arrived on Saturday evening and all the big revelations had taken place before midnight Sunday.
While it was uneventful in terms of any wetting together or other sex play, we did get around a bit. We went swimming in Lake Coeur d&#039;Alene, borrowed a friend&#039;s sailboat for a day, spent one whole day shopping and Carol tried to teach me how to play golf – sorry, but that&#039;s just not going to happen! Through it all there was, for me at…</p>

        <p class="card-text">*** Why Is The Bed Wet?
I met this girl named Kate about a year ago. We were both 25 at the time and we have been dating since. Things were going well for us. But recently Kate began having this problem...
&quot;Kate, Why is the bed wet?&quot; I asked as I woke her up from a sleep.
&quot;WHAT?&quot; Kate yelled as she sat right up in bed. &quot;Oh my god! I ... I wet the bed!&quot; Kate was sitting in a large puddle in the bed. The sheets were wet enough that you could see liquid being squeezed out of the fabric as she moved. I woke because I felt the wetness seep over to my side of the bed and found my pajamas wet as well. Kate had a sheer panic look on her face and tears were forming in her eyes.
&quot;Shhh ... Kate it&#039;s ok, accidents…</p>
