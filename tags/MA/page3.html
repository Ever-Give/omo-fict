        <p class="card-text">It all started for me when I moved with my parents to the town my mother grew up in. We went living next to my uncle and aunt, but more importantly my niece Caroline. It was the beginning of the summer–vacation when we moved, so my parents had time to settle down in the new house before they had to start working again. This gave me the time to get to know the town a bit better and to make some friends before school started. Caroline showed me around and introduced me to some of her friends. We spent a lot of time together and grew quite close. One day we decided to go to the beach together, well beach is a somehow big word. It was a river with a bit of sand on the shores. The best spot happened to be behind…</p>

Laura was sitting in the folding chair, filming Gillian as she was holding Marianne and felt her body quiver with lust and expectation, but also with the urgent need to pee. They had been hiking almost two hours now, and the nice pee break behind the picturesque chapel had been before they started. Laura felt the three litres of water she had drunk in the meantime filling her bladder to full capacity. She was on the verge of letting go; she wanted to pee right in the chair she sat in. Thinking about this she realized Marianne could look right up her crotch since she wasn&#039;t…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Elizabeth is taking a walk through the forest with her sisters. They&#039;re on holidays and decided to go out to enjoy the wild. Suddenly Michelle stops, and Alyssa and Elizabeth turn around to see what&#039;s going on.
Michelle: &quot;Wait a minute girls, I have to pee, can&#039;t hold it anymore.&quot;
Elizabeth guesses that her sister is going to go behind the bushes, or even pull down her jeans and panties to squat right there, but gets surprised seeing Michelle just standing still and closing her eyes. From where she stands she can&#039;t see anything unusual, but now she&#039;s looking at her from behind and sees two lines of wetness starting to form down her sister&#039;s legs as a wet stain grows in her ass.

Carrie and Brad were a happy couple in their late twenties, their strong marriage made stronger by a great sex life.
Carrie was slim and fit; she&#039;d been a swimmer in school. She was small–breasted with a tight butt and gorgeous natural blonde hair. Brad was taller and more substantial, oftentimes looming over her, but she was the more forceful personality; Brad was a gentle soul, but with a mischievous streak.
Carrie was not terribly pee–shy; she&#039;d grown up with three brothers, and when they&#039;d been small they&#039;d routinely peed in front of each other. So Carrie was never overly concerned about anyone seeing her…</p>

It was a sisters&#039; night out. They stayed at the bar a couple of hours, drinking, looking at guys and chatting about recent events (except for Elizabeth and Alyssa don&#039;t share certain secrets with their little sister). Then they decided it was late and went home. Michelle took a bus, while Elizabeth walked Alyssa to their mother&#039;s home, since her sister was pretty drunk. Considering that their mother was out on a trip, she decided to stay all night with her sister, so they took a cab and headed home. Alyssa was barely able to stay awake during the trip, and…</p>

Aunt May was always happy to put up anyone who dropped in, whether they were expected or not, so I decided to surprise her and turn up unannounced. I arrived about 7pm on Friday evening, knocked the door, walked in and shouted &quot;Hi!&quot;
I was a little surprised when a young female voice shouted back, &quot;Who&#039;s that?&quot; I walked into the lounge and saw that Jenny and Jilly were sitting on the sofa with no sign of Aunt May. Jenny and Jilly were identical twins that lived across the road from Aunt May. They were about 23 years old and were absolutely gorgeous. &quot;Oh, Hi Gord,&quot; said Jilly, &quot;Your…</p>

Carlee really enjoys her new job as a meter reader for the public works department. She had always been an outdoors type, but not like the earthy women one usually associates with this stereotype. Carlee was 23–years–old, fresh out of university and working towards a career in municipal government. She thought that starting out with a first job as a meter reader would enable her to get real–world experience in local government as well as helping her keep fit. At the same time, she also thought that this job would allow her to indulge in her fetish of desperation and panty wetting, without anyone knowing.

I fell in love with this girl a couple years ago when we were seniors in high school. We had flirted around for a couple of months when a mutual friend finally hooked us up. I couldn&#039;t believe my luck that this slender, athletic blonde country girl wanted to hook up with me.

        <p class="card-text">Let me first explain why I&#039;m writing these stories. I&#039;ve got kind of a dilemma. I really enjoy desperation stories, but whenever I encounter such situations in real life, I&#039;m far too much of a nice guy to try and prolong a girl&#039;s need. In fact, on the most notable occasions, I&#039;ve felt extremely bad for them, and even worse at the simple idea that I&#039;d enjoy such a situation.
So I&#039;ve concocted Parker. Parker isn&#039;t really me; most of the stories I&#039;m telling here are entirely fictional. But Parker&#039;s got my approach: when a girl needs to pee around him, he tries to help her as much as he can. He doesn&#039;t get off on it until later (and I don&#039;t do that, not if the girl in question is a friend of mine; it would be way…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Michelle is feeling that familiar sensation in her bladder, telling her that she had been holding too long and it&#039;s time to go to the toilet. It&#039;s past noon and she hasn&#039;t moved from her desk since she arrived that morning. And worse, all the coffee she drunk all morning has since descended to her bladder.
In another situation she wouldn&#039;t have gave it a second thought and would have walked the thirty steps that separated her office from the toilets (two of them, shared with the rest of the offices on the floor), but that time she couldn&#039;t do it because her sister (the only one that worked with her in the family business) had gone out to do some errands. To being able to go to the toilet, she would&#039;ve had to…</p>

Sex was great but we had no real connection. My girlfriend Courtney took it much harder than I did. She called me about a dozen times a day to make sure I was all right. I was!
About a week after the break–up she called and insisted that we have &quot;girl&#039;s night.&quot; I did not need one, but it seemed fun anyway.
She took me to the liquor store and insisted that we buy the best. She had more money than I so I let her pick the drinks. She worked for a law firm. Although she was only a secretary she seemed to run the place. Anyway, money was no problem for her.…</p>

Mel is the type of girl that has &quot;the eyes.&quot; &quot;The eyes&quot; are the type of eyes that can give a super sexy look and get anyone to do anything. She fidgeted with her panties for a moment as they were riding into her crotch cause she liked to wear tight satin panties. These ones were blue with flower prints on them under her baby pink mini skirt. She made sure her tits looked nice and perky in her matching pink halter–top and knocked on the door. After she knocked on the door she realized pulling her panties out of her pussy made her horny and she shifted her legs.…</p>

My interests include female desperation, and accidental wetting, specifically the exact moment when one becomes the other. My stories will therefore focus on this momentary loss of control. This first story of mine, however, is not part of the series and is based on a true story. The first half of the story is true, at least the parts I can be sure about, however the second half is what I wish I had done. Peter Hiss is the pseudonym I use in and around desperation, it is best pronounced &quot;PEE–ter, hisssss&quot; as in the sound a girl makes while pissing her pants. I will say I am Canadian, but if…</p>

Tammy broke her ankle a few days back and she probably had a bad case of cabin fever. There was no way I could turn her down, even in the middle of a busy Sunday.
I have to admit Tammy looks very cute on crutches. She&#039;s petite and wears these pleated mini skirts that give her the prep school girl look even though we&#039;re older than that. Everyone was very courteous at the restaurant, holding the door open for her and giving her sympathetic smiles.
I&#039;m technically hotter, but she looks younger and more endearing. I was glad I wore my tank top and really short…</p>
