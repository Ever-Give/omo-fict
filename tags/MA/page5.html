        <p class="card-text">Nikki had the day off work and was home alone. It was a warm summer day and Nikki was wearing one of those long flowing gauze skirts that you twist after you wash it. She was also wearing a cute little white t–shirt that showed off her tan tummy. She wore nothing on her feet because she liked to feel to cool floors when she walked around the house.
It was a little after noon and Nikki was relaxing on the couch reading a book. As was her habit, she had already had quite a lot of liquid to drink– orange juice with breakfast, a large tea, and several glasses of water.
Nikki&#039;s reason for constantly sipping water was not only for the health benefits, but also because of a little fetish she had. Nobody, but her…</p>

Part Two
The polished hardwood floor of the ballroom glistened; the lights from the chandeliers overhead were reflected in the varnish of the wood. Spacious, the room stretched from one end of the old mansion to the other, high ceilings adorned with artwork, sculptures embedded in the royal columns that supported the old roof. A long bar, covered in black velvet formed the right border of the room, in the back, a double doorway led to the hallway of the old mansion. Before the doorway, still in the ballroom, a small antique table with an old lamp on it and a set of ledgers…</p>

The rain beat down remorselessly on the fly sheet of the tent while Helen tossed and turned in a vain attempt to get to sleep; but try as she might she could not get comfortable. Eventually, remembering something she had once read about the sleep–inducing qualities of the female orgasm, she gently lifted the hem of the long pink cotton T–shirt which had served her as a her night dress during her camping holiday with Andy, and slipped her hand down inside the front of her knickers.
They were the same dark blue knickers she had worn that day at Byron&#039;s Pool when Andy had caressed her, and fondled her, and…</p>

Cultural Anthropology was always so boring, and today he had been even more anxious for it to be over because he really had to go to the bathroom. He&#039;d had a big breakfast and didn&#039;t get the chance to relieve himself before coming to class like he normally does, so he was getting rather uncomfortable by the end of Professor Johnson&#039;s lecture.
A crowd of students began milling around the professor to ask him about the day&#039;s notes, but Chris was lucky enough to push out of the classroom before they started blocking the door. He…</p>

Someone could come by and interrupt me, or something might come up. Usually when I write a story at work it takes most of the day. Right now it&#039;s 10am. I got here at 7am. Like all slow days it&#039;s tough to stay awake, and since I&#039;m new here I don&#039;t think it would be good for me to be found sleeping at my desk.

The 5&#039; 8&quot; tall 18–year–old college freshman was having a difficult time adjusting to life away from home. When she found herself short of time, it was usually her toilet visit that was sacrificed. Her busy class schedule, dorm living and pet–sitting job combined to leave the beautiful, bright, big bodied, but bodacious busted bubble–butt brunette&#039;s bladder being badly bursting before bathroom break (whew!) each day. Her bladder capacity did grow to accommodate her schedule, however, and became less a problem. At first, Tamara would rush to the dorm after classes to relieve her tortured body of its treasure of liquid gold, but as her capacity grew…</p>

I was covered in blankets and nice and warm, but not quite warm enough. I was mildly horny because of a movie I had watched before going to bed. I did not recognize the star actor, but he was hot. At one point in the movie he kissed a beautiful redhead. I must admit that during the kiss scene I was more watching the redhead than the star actor. I wished I were she. She is so hot, with such a nice body.

        <p class="card-text">The sun shone through the window on the beautiful June morning, the slivers of sunlight beamed through the curtains into the bedroom. A ray of light hits a sleeping girl&#039;s face and she tosses and turns as she slides into consciousness. Today was Shannon&#039;s 18th birthday and she couldn&#039;t have asked for a more beautiful day to celebrate it on. There wasn&#039;t a cloud in the sky and it was a perfect 30 degrees outside. Her friends had decided that they were going to take Shannon to dinner for her birthday and then throw her a party at her friend Sarah&#039;s house. Shannon knew that she probably would get some really cool stuff for her birthday because she hounded her friends and family for weeks telling them what she…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Godfrey was sat on the train, reading his newspaper on his way home from a business trip. It was a two–carriage train and it was beginning to fill up, but the seat next to him was still empty, which pleased him. At the next station, however, several more passengers got on, including a very pretty blonde girl in her early twenties, who came and sat next to him. Godfrey shuffled up a bit to make room for the young lady. As the train pulled out of the station the young lady looked round and upon seeing that everyone was seated, she got up and went toward the toilet. She returned almost immediately and sat down looking a little irritated and uncomfortable. &quot;Typical of this damned rail company,&quot; she complained to…</p>

George prides himself on his analytical skills and determination to get things done. Now, however, George is simply baffled. His latest device fails to work. He has checked and rechecked his design; this doesn&#039;t happen to him. Based on secret medical data, the device is intended to project a signal to enemy soldiers, which will be received directly into the brain. This signal is computer generated and intended to mimic human synaptic generation.

She had a pretty smile and long blonde hair and a tiny sexy body. And she was wearing a cheerleader uniform.
&quot;Hello Mr. Thompson, I am Jenny. Amanda told me you needed somebody part time.&quot;

&quot;Yes Sir, we are in the same class at school.&quot;
&quot;Well if you are in her class then I am sorry but you are too young to work here.&quot;

Sharon wasn&#039;t altogether happy with the idea of sharing a sleeping compartment with a total stranger, but that was the deal if you could only afford a standard class fare.
