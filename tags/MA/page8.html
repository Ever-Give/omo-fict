        <p class="card-text">Susan and Gemma were returning home from a Friday night trip into town. They had met some friends in a bar where they had enjoyed a pint or two before someone had suggested a visit to a beer festival just down the road. On arrival several of their party had disappeared to the loos while Gemma and Susan went to get a round in. As they met up again one of the other girls said she did not recommend the toilets, as they were disgusting. In fact they were just a portacabin each for the men and for the women and both were totally inadequate for the number of visitors to the festival that night.
Gemma already needed a wee but decided to wait a while. After their third pint of the evening she decided that she couldn…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Earlier today I had my first wetting experience (Playing Sick), and I can&#039;t stop thinking about it! I remember the warmth forming between my legs. I remember orgasming like I never have before as the pee flooded my panties. It was the most orgasmic experience of my life, but I needed to make it better. Last time I peed on the toilet. This time I would need to do something more exotic!
I lay back on my bed, again trying to study for my test. After all, I do have a test today. I tried to think of equations, but all I could think of was the sight of that wonderful dark patch growing in my panties earlier today. My panties were white and the pee was wet; it felt so good. It even flooded my bottom as I sat on the…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Barbara awoke slightly aware that something was wrong– her eyes flicked open, and she was not sitting in a country gateway with her panties round her ankles. She was in bed, with alarm bells sounding in her mind. Her hand went down to her panty crotch to confirm what her waking mind already knew. She had wet the bed!
She had been dreaming that she had been out walking her new baby son Mark around the countryside in his pushchair. She had somehow gotten lost, and was unsure about which way to go to find the quickest way home. Above all she really needed to wee but was unsure of the length of time it would be till she could make it all the way home.
Her need had suddenly become urgent and with her pelvic…</p>

        <p class="card-text">The most daring I have ever been was in July of this year. It was a Sunday afternoon, chilly but crisp and clear. I was sitting on the balcony of my apartment, drinking beer with my new flat mate, Anna. We were chatting away comfortably when she mentioned the time she had wet herself after a university pub–crawl. I was instantly aroused, and tipsy enough to press her for more details. Anna was very obliging, in no way guessing that she had inadvertently stepped right into the territory of my secret passion. Then she turned it round, and asked me when I last had an accident. I couldn&#039;t tiptoe round the issue, for the beer had made me alarmingly honest. I felt myself go bright red, and Anna, realizing straight…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Ingrid didn&#039;t really remember how it started. Probably some time in early childhood, when she discovered that putting off going to the little girls&#039; room caused a mix between pain and pleasure that made her tingle all over. Like everybody else she peed in the sea when she had to, but eventually she always was careful to avoid the toilet before going to the beach. From just letting go under water, she began releasing her urine as she waded in, feeling the warm wetness in her bathing suit seconds before the water reached her crotch. Lingering in the shower after exercises at school, she let it run down her legs when nobody could see her. Soaking in the tub at home, she spread her legs as the water drained,…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Hi. This is a personal account of some of what is going on in my life right now. I only recently discovered that I wasn&#039;t the only person in the world who enjoyed wetting my pants, so the stories here have been a real revelation to me. After reading a bunch of them I decided to write about my own experiences, I hope you like them. This story is mostly true– I just changed enough details to make it pretty hard for someone to actually find me. I&#039;m not going to publish my e–mail right now, maybe with a later installment. Enjoy! I sure enjoyed writing it – almost as much as I enjoyed doing it when it happened. –– Janis

I saw you looking at yourself in the mirror, admiring your curves that I had liked so much. Watching you admiring yourself turned me on so much!
I also noticed that you had damp panties, like you had recently accidentally wet yourself a little. I didn&#039;t know why, but I found the idea very arousing, and as my breath came is shuddering whispers my hand found its way slowly…</p>

I am a senior, and failing this test could be the end of my academic career. I thought of a way out; I would pretend to be sick. I didn&#039;t do this often because I was a good girl... overall. I rarely needed to make excuses, but today was the exception.
The alarm rang for about three minutes before mom came in. She shook me, and asked me if I was awake. I was, of course, but I pretended not to be. After a few seconds, I rose suddenly, and sat up. I told mom of my upset stomach, and my throbbing head. She had no reason to doubt me since I almost never missed school.…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Karen, Mia and I had been friends since going to college at Ohio State University. We had all had a few serious dating relationships since college, but always seemed to get back together when those relationships failed.
This weekend we rented a cabin and a rowboat in the woods near a small lake in West Virginia. The cabin included just the bare necessities, and was pretty isolated from the rest of the campers on the lake.
We started drinking beer about 7:00 pm, and decided to take the rowboat out for a trip around the lake. We took a cooler of beer with us, and headed out to explore the lake.

She peered outside at the early summer day, clouds puffy and white in the sky, people walking along the busy street in the harried pace of the office employee, heads down, moving with purpose along the sidewalks. Moving from the window to her dining table, she picked up her resume and read it once again, double–checking for spelling errors and considering yet again rewriting her summary to put a different slant on her skills. The interview was at 12:00 noon downtown, about a mile away from her upscale apartment and Jenny was nervous. She needed a job, and the economic woes had made them scarce to come…</p>

I grew up on a secluded New Zealand farm, very steep country, but lovely native forest with sparkling streams and rivers. This story is from my favorite place in the world! It is from early on in my wetting, back when it was more fun than sexual. I hope you like it.
I guess I first got interested in wetting my panties at an early age, too. I remember growing up on our farm, and a lot of the time I would be left to my own for long periods of time. Summer was the best time of the year.…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Linda didn&#039;t know why she enjoyed wetting herself. She only knew the secret pleasure of letting go into her panties. The sensual release she felt as the wet patch at her crotch moved up and down the inside of her thighs, spreading a comfortable warmth in her most sensitive areas. For years, she had reveled in the shameful naughtiness of the act, but she did not try to understand it.
Maybe that was all there was to it, she thought to herself as she lay on her bed, idly fondling the crotch of her jeans. Linda looked at her watch and frowned. Her girlfriends were supposed to call her when they were ready to meet. If they didn&#039;t come soon, they were going to miss the movie.
No matter, she decided. She had…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Mary Ann Gardener wrinkles her pert nose in disdain as she walks, quickly, past the ladies&#039; room. She and her husband Richard have spent the early evening dining and dancing at their country club and are getting ready to go home. She can make it home; She is a lady, a grown woman, not a child. She dislikes public restrooms anyway. She really doesn&#039;t like to pee in a restroom at all. It is no secret. There is more, but it is very secret. No one must ever know. Mary Ann is a lady. She keeps the arousing thoughts away. Richard would never understand.

        <p class="card-text">Part 1 – Motorbike Wetting
I&#039;m a 23–year old German girl. Three weeks ago we made a tour through Europe with our motorbikes. &quot;We&quot; are five male friends and I. I was the only girl, and that was my first big tour.
At the planning of the tour meeting, I forgot something to tell to the others: I have a very small bladder. The first day was okay. It was cloudy and so it was not very hot. We started at 8:30 am and drove until 6 pm, with a break about every two and a half hours.
But, the second day was very hot. Everyone drank very much in the first break, which was at 11 am. Then we all went to the toilet before getting back on the road, myself included. After about one hour of driving, my bladder again started…</p>
