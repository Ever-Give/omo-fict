        <p class="card-text">That night, when she came home, she was feeling very naughty....
But let&#039;s start at the beginning. Nicole was a very hot girl in her early twenties. With her long blonde hair, she was a typical cheerleader type– wearing the latest and tightest fashion around. Her favorites were a black lycra–spandex pair of pants, a thong (as long as it wasn&#039;t visible from any angle) and a matching black top (preferably without a bra, as gravity hadn&#039;t gotten hold of her nice breasts yet). And even though a push up bra would have fitted her well, she wasn&#039;t planning on wearing one tonight. She would have a lot of moments for herself and didn&#039;t want to be blocked from touching her nipples in any way.
For the same reason she…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Melissa Barnes was running late for work. Her car was nearly out of fuel and she really, really needed to pee. She debated with herself about what to do. As a sudden spasm of her distended bladder came over her, she jammed her hand into her crotch to stem the impending flood. She rubbed her pussy, hard, barely getting control. It did not bother her that a small squirt of her golden fluid had escaped despite her best efforts. Melissa had always enjoyed peeing her panties, and just because it was not convenient was little reason not to enjoy it, especially if it was out of her control. She closed her bright blue eyes for a second, enjoying the feelings between her shapely legs. Melissa kept her ex–cheerleader&#039;s…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Sheila was on her way home from college. She was sitting by window, alone in the train. She was looking forward to getting home soon; she hadn&#039;t seen her sister for two weeks. Sheila was a tall, slim, 19 year–old woman with well–sized breasts and long hair. She had very nice sexy butt and her pussy was really perfect, shaved into a slim decorated line.
She was wearing white elastic trousers and a purple shirt beneath which was white lacy bra that was very sexy. On her sexy ass she was wearing nice white lacy panties, no thongs because she didn&#039;t feel comfortable with them in the train. Sheila was single; she didn&#039;t get on well with her last boyfriend because he was jealous when she was enjoying sex with other…</p>

        <p class="card-text">She could make me do anything.
I first saw her at an early–morning swim. We were the first to arrive, before the hall filled up. She was swimming with slow, easy strokes, doing flip–turns and sliding under water, long hair streaming. She was wearing a red, high–cut swimsuit, emphasizing her slender, well–trained body. I went in, doing the best I could, but found her passing me again and again. I had to admire the elegant way she moved in the water.
Suddenly she was gone. I decided it was time to return to the dressing room.
We were still alone. She stood under the shower, back to me, washing her hair. She looked to be in her early forties, but very fit for her age, with slim waist, tight buttocks and just a…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Gina Marstin sat at her computer with her hand between her legs trying to prolong the inevitable... a trip to the bathroom to relieve her torturously full and visibly swollen bladder. It wasn&#039;t that this would provide any help in keeping her silky white nylon panties dry; they had hosted her deliciously wet pussy for quite some time before her desperation (and her fingers) had entered the picture. As she contemplated her trip to the bathroom she thought how she, always so prim and proper, had arrived at this point.
She and her husband were opposites in everything they did. She was an early riser and he liked to sleep in. Since their bedroom time was so different, they discovered early in their 12–year…</p>

        <p class="card-text">We married quite young; I was twenty–one and Tracy was twenty. I had admired her shapely body in the tight jeans for some time before things fell into place and we started dating. We got married within a year.
I first met her sister at the wedding. Lynn was eighteen with a slender body, usually dressed in tight, short dresses and skirts, or leggings and t–shirt. Tracy didn&#039;t mind me noticing her sister. Isn&#039;t she cute? She used to say, &quot;don&#039;t you just love her?&quot; Not as much as I love you, was my truthful answer.
The summer after the wedding we spent two weeks at Tracy&#039;s family&#039;s summerhouse by the sea. One day Lynn turned up unexpectedly. &quot;Time to check out the happy couple,&quot; she said. &quot;Still in love?&quot;

She lived with her 3 older brothers who were very highly sexed and loved seeing girls bursting for a pee. They also lived with her parents who knew nothing of their sons&#039; peculiar pastime and were very prim and proper. They would think that the sight of an 18 year old wetting her pants was an absolute disgrace, and could not even imagine that anyone could &#039;get off&#039; on such a thing.
Well one Friday evening the brothers decided that it would be amazing to contrive a plan, working together to make Chloe absolutely desperate for a pee, and then ultimately wee in her knickers in public.

        <p class="card-text">This story is based on real facts. (Everything related in it its true and happened some time ago).
On a fine sunny Friday of late May, my ex girlfriend and I decided to go on a trip to the mountains, just the two of us. (It was actually planned to make things work better between us.)
So on that Friday afternoon we went to the station and we took the train to Brasov situated 140 Kilometers from our city. From there we took a bus to the resort where we were going.
We arrived at about 6:00 pm, and we took out a room in a villa. Things were going really well. After settling down we went down to a club to spend our first evening. (This was at about 8:30 pm)
My girlfriend, Maria, was dressed in a nice pair of…</p>

        <p class="card-text">When Katie awoke some time later, finding that she smelling strongly of dried pee, she remembered that she had to get the mink panties cleaned. She picked up the phone and rang the express collect delivery service, finding that an item could be cleaned and returned within an hour. Retrieving the panties from the radiator, she found that though they were dry they had a strong pungent odor, so to avoid embarrassment she added some strong perfume. Then sealing them in a bag, it would not completely mask the sexy smell but it might stop the cleaners from thinking too much.
The courier called later for the dirty panties, promising to return them in an hour and a half, leaving Katie time to shower, wash her hair…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Maggie checked her watch. Just past 5:30 and just outside her comfort zone. Six months into her job and life in New York, and she had the timing down perfectly. Two liters of water and no restroom breaks after 4:00, and let the rumbling on the subway do the rest. 
It was late October, and that morning had been pleasantly chilly on the walk from her apartment to the station and then to her office at the end of the line. The overcast sky and the ever so slight nip in the breeze had gotten her thinking; maybe this was one of her special days. When lunchtime had finally rolled around, she&#039;d known for sure. Friday night, a place of her own downtown, all that time to herself and the melancholy from the last breakup…</p>

This is the true story of my first sexual encounter with piss. It was when I was 18 during the summer break.I spent my morning reading a book and drinking as it was a fairly hot day and only went to the toilet once after I woke up. After I finished the book, I went to the mall as I was planning to see a movie with my friend Jade. I met her at the box office and we bought our tickets and cokes. It was one of those really long movies and we both wanted to watch it for some time but we hadn&#039;t come round to it so this was one of the last screenings of the movie. We entered the cinema and it was fairly empty, there were only 2 other people in there. We picked some seats at the back away…</p>

        <p class="card-text">From an early age I discovered that I obtained much sexual pleasure from holding my pee until I was really desperate. I&#039;ve often played little games with myself whilst out and about just seeing how long I can hold out without going to the toilet. Last weekend I woke up needing a wee but decided to hold on. I was planning a shopping trip and the thought of walking around town whilst desperate to wee was already turning me on. I drank plenty of orange juice with my breakfast and could already feel the pressure on my bladder building up. I put on my short denim skirt and a pair of black panties and set off for town.
The town was very busy and there were lots of queues. At one point whilst waiting at the bank I…</p>
