        <p class="card-text">I&#039;d been called in to investigate a commercial burglary. As the first detective on the scene, I walked into the second floor office. I saw a beautiful woman tied to her office chair: her arms bound to the chair arms, and her legs tied apart, also to the arms of the chair. Her skirt had ridden up to reveal some of her beautifully nylon–clad legs. She was blindfolded. There was a piece of duct tape securing her mouth. She was pulling and writhing against the restraints in an effort to get herself out of the chair.
I removed the blindfold and I showed her my badge, and her eyes signaled her relief. From under the duct tape, she was trying to talk or scream to no avail. The crime scene investigators were on their…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Sayuri shifted uncomfortably in the driver&#039;s seat of her Mercury Tracer. She had been sitting there for more than two hours: Her butt was numb; the backs of her thighs ached, and her bladder was almost bursting. She reflected ruefully that they never showed this aspect of a stakeout in the movies. Male detectives either had cast–iron bladders, or they would simply step out of the car and pee in the gutter. For a woman, that wasn&#039;t an option, especially not on a street bordered on one side by a high wall and on the other by a residential estate. She adjusted herself in her seat, flicking her long, black, slightly curly hair over her shoulders, and wondered how much longer she would have to sit there before her…</p>

        <p class="card-text">In all my life I had never known anyone who was remotely as androgynous as Terri. Everything about her was just totally ambiguous, and I continued to harbour some residual doubts as to her true sex right up to the moment she began to wet herself. And even then, it was only the obviously &quot;female&quot; pattern of the wet spot spreading across the front of her jeans from a point slightly below the bottom of her zipper which finally convinced me that she had to be a girl, even though the visible fastenings on her clothes all did up on the &quot;boys&#039; side.&quot;
She boarded my train at Mile End. I had traveled in from Loughton, so naturally I had a seat. By Mile End, however, the train was becoming crowded and several people…</p>

I take the dress off the hanger and brush my hand across the smooth, shimmering ruby–red fabric. The anticipation already sends little sparks of pleasure through my mind and body. I feel the tips of my nipples harden slightly and a warm sensation passes over my breasts and between my thighs. Stepping into the dress and slowly pulling it up and over my legs, watching in the mirror as it climbs over my thighs and hips. The sheer light tan tights and white satin high–leg briefs I&#039;ve chosen are slowly covered by the sheer red body of my outfit and I finish running the dress over my bare chest, already cupping and gathering my breasts…</p>

        <p class="card-text">20–year–old Tiffany was late for class again. She knew that her professor was going to be very upset with her for being late again and would probably fail her on the lab that she was late for. She brushed her brunette hair that fell to her shoulders, wishing that she had a roommate to wake her up. She hated living by herself. Looking in the mirror she noticed she was standing there in nothing but a white pair of bikini panties and a white bra. She quickly slipped on a pink skirt with a matching belt and pulled on thigh high tan stockings. She threw on a white halter–top, slipped on shoes, gulped down a cup of coffee, and ran out the door. She started running to class when she realized that she had forgotten…</p>

When she woke up, her long brunette hair was all in clumps, and when she went to get out of bed her pajamas caught on the bed post and ripped right at the crotch. She wanted to cry, but figured she could just sew it later. As she walked into the bathroom, she noticed all her dirty clothes lying on the floor and knew that she had to go do laundry today. She quickly stepped in the shower and washed her hair, but it was still hard to brush when she came out.
She wrapped a towel around her tight body and walked to her dresser, where she found she had no clean clothes. She looked at the dirty laundry pile realizing how bad the day was going. She picked…</p>

        <p class="card-text">When I first met Gill, it was a mutual attraction. She was an attractive blond, quite tall and at the time innocent, or so I thought. We were soon beyond just kissing and cuddling and starting to become more adventurous. But even in those early days there was a hint of things to come, but I was slow to recognize it.
She had a lovely body (still has) and I enjoyed looking at it and playing with it, as she did mine. I should have taken more notice of something that happened every time we indulged in mutual masturbation.
Either she went to the bathroom first, or wanted to when she was near to climax, but put it off till after we had cum and then sprinted for the toilet. At that time our activities where…</p>

Just as she thought she&#039;d make a break for the bathroom anyway, a woman came up to the purse counter she was working.

        <p class="card-text">Kandra put both of her hands onto the rails of the lifeguard chair and lifted her body up into a standing position, her bare feet curled onto the rungs of the chair below. She arched her back to stretch and she tilted her head back, her long straight blond hair flowing straight down, shimmering in the remaining rays of late afternoon sunlight that shone through the large plate glass windows of the indoor pool. She looked like the letter &quot;C,&quot; her athletic body arched as she paused in the position, working the kinks out of her back after sitting for so long. Her red official lifeguard one piece bathing suit fit tightly against her slightly tanned body, her toned abs taut underneath the red fabric, her legs…</p>

        <p class="card-text">This is my first attempt at posting here – hope you like it. This is also a fantasy – there is no Sarah and the events portrayed are completely fictitious.
I&#039;d been going out with Sarah for quite some time, and we had a fairy normal boyfriend/girlfriend relationship in all respects. I had never mentioned my interest in watersports and I&#039;d never had the slightest indication that she was interested either. Then one day we decided to go to the seaside. We wanted somewhere fairly secluded, so the trip turned into a long weekend in Cornwall. I don&#039;t remember exactly where we ended up – we stayed at a B&amp;B in Truro, but we drove for quite a while before we found what we were looking for. The beach was perfect – a…</p>

I did something new last night. I&#039;ve been reading the stories on this site for about a year and enjoying them and some of the pictures. What I&#039;ve most enjoyed is the knowledge that there are other people out there who enjoy the same sort of thing that I do. I thank you all for being there and helping me enjoy being the person who I am. But about last night...
I enjoy wetting myself. If you&#039;ve been reading my stories from last summer that should be pretty obvious. I&#039;ve been wetting my panties for several years and discovered the thrill of actually wetting my pants last summer. I can hardly get enough of that feeling when I first start to let it go, when I can&#039;t quite tell if I&#039;m getting wet or…</p>

        <p class="card-text">As she watched her mom pull out of the driveway, Becca could hardly contain her excitement. She had waited all morning for this. She had started the day by drinking lots and lots of coffee, telling her mom that she needed to wake herself up to study for her finals. As she sat down at the computer now, she started to look at sites with pictures– pictures of girls wetting their panties, pictures of girls masturbating, and even pictures of girls humping each other. How she longed to do the same. Her clit began to tingle.
Her mom had told her to do the laundry. Now she had a wonderful idea. She made her way into the laundry room, and decided to do a load of jeans. She picked up the first pair, and put them on.…</p>

I thought I had sent it just a couple days after part two, but I think I suffered a bit of an organizational breakdown. At any rate it never got sent, but here it is now, better late than never. I hope you all are enjoying reading this– it has gotten longer than I thought it would. At first I thought two parts would take care of it, but it is really a lot of fun to write about, so I&#039;m including all the detail I can remember. I&#039;ve decided to put my e–mail address on this one just so I can hear how you all like my story. You can write me using the link at the bottom of this page.
