        <p class="card-text">Randi was kicking herself for not going to the bathroom before setting out on her bike for a day&#039;s ride. Of course, there wasn&#039;t much to kick. At barely 100 pounds, she was a petite brunette with a small chest and a cute smile that showed off her braces. She had a slim figure and dark brown eyes that often shined in a naughty way when Randi had one of her schemes in mind. This was one of those schemes. She was scolding herself for leaving the house in tight, white jeans without peeing first, but it was a playful scolding and she intended to have fun today. The five glasses of water were beginning to make Randi feel full as she rode through the countryside that surrounded her house. She rationalized that that…</p>

        <p class="card-text">The next day in school I met up with Jo–Anne during lunch break. I hadn&#039;t gone to the toilets after my morning pee, and neither had Jo–Anne. We went to the football field to watch the school team practice. That was something we always did, but this time we went there more to pee our panties than to watch the game. We were sitting on the grass, our skirts out of the way and our legs up a bit. I counted down from 3 and we started to wet our panties at the same time. It felt great to pee in our panties with so many people around, and no one could see it. After lunch we went back to class, and the rest of the day I went to the toilet to pee trough my panties every chance I got, and more often than not I met…</p>

        <p class="card-text">This is Donna&#039;s story. I will tell it to you as she related it to us. One day, a few years ago Donna was outside with a few friends in the garden and they were all very giggly. At one point they were challenging each other to do all sort of things. Finally they challenged one of the girls to wet herself, which she did to her friends&#039; shock and laughter. They all laughed so hard that they almost ended up with wet pants.
A few days later she was in a store with one of those friends and she had to pee. Donna suggested to her that she could always pee her pants, just like the last time. Her friend suddenly got real nervous and giggly and asked Donna if she really meant that. Donna pressed the girl to just go in…</p>

        <p class="card-text">I&#039;m Lori, and I guess a few of you out there have liked hearing about certain things I do when I&#039;m by myself and I get a thrill telling about it. I do have a &quot;session,&quot; as I call them, that I&#039;ll describe. It&#039;s about doing it in these tight–as–skin jean cutoffs. I&#039;ll tell how I pissed in them on purpose then squirmed myself against all the hot naughtiness until I came.
You anxious boys (and girls too, I hope) that can&#039;t abide a touch of foreshadowing and background to illuminate and color this magical thing that makes us all interested in reading this stuff – you can click this narrative down, and get right to the description of my act. But I want to describe a little bit why I do what I do...I think it might…</p>

        <p class="card-text">After the phone sex I had with Amanda, my college lecturer, we had both promised to refrain from any sexual indulgence until our arranged meeting the following afternoon. By that time we would both be feeling very horny, and we had also decided to resist relieving our bladders from lunch onwards. I was more than happy to agree, &quot;but don&#039;t forget,&quot; I had reminded her. &quot;You have us for P E at the last session – you don&#039;t want me to wet myself during that?&quot; &quot;No,&quot; she said, &quot;but it will be nicer if we are both having to hold on, so be a good girl until then, good bye.&quot; The phone went dead, leaving me sitting on the toilet tingling with anticipation, my hand still in my wet panties, it was all I could do to keep my…</p>
