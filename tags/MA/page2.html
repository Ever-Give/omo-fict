Alisha was a university graduate in her twenties. She was raised in a conservative family but had always wanted to explore her secret hidden desires. She was sweet looking on the outside with her curly light brown hair and her cute little smile. She also was a bit sexy looking, her chest a little bit above average and with a nice bottom. Though she was a little bit shy sometimes, she was the…</p>

Julia and Jessica had been friends since childhood. They had grown up together and were now 20 years old. They had always talked openly together about almost everything, including sexual urges and behaviour. Occasionally they indulged in wetting themselves together, for they both enjoyed feeling their bladders filling up to their capacity and sometimes they went that one bit too far. One Saturday the two were shopping in town. They had drunk several large cokes during the morning and were seated in the…</p>

The bus arrived and Ann and Linda got on. When they were sitting Ann looked around. They were sitting at the back of the bus and no one was near them. Ann leaned over to Linda. &quot;I do it here IF you promise to pee through your panties on the toilet in the mall.&quot; Linda thought about it for a few seconds. She was wearing black jeans so it wouldn&#039;t show a wet spot if she pulled her pants up to her wet panties. &quot;Deal, but I only promise to try, I don&#039;t know if I can do it!&quot;
Ann just got up a little bit and pulled her skirt out from her bottom. She sat back down, folded her skirt up so it wasn&#039;t conspicuous but clearly…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Most people thought of them as the most despicable/disgusting/unpopular girls in the school, but some thought of them as heroes – not to mention a real turn–on.
The pee gang was a group of three senior girls – Rachel, Melissa, and Randy. They were famous for the wetting stunts they frequently pulled. Probably their favourite trick was to use a two code–word system. Most people had no idea how they did it, but then again most people didn&#039;t try to be around every time the pee gang put on one of their shows. They&#039;d stage a casual conversation, use one code–word to indicate when they were ready, which would then be repeated by all the other members of the group to indicate that they, too, were ready, and another…</p>

Margaret, Maisie and Mandy were sisters. Margaret was the oldest aged 22, Maisie was 20, and Mandy was 19.
About 5 years ago, while she was in school, Maisie had taken part in a French Exchange visit, where she went to stay with a family near Lyons for two weeks, and then the daughter of the French family, Juliette, came to stay with them for two weeks. They had kept in touch, and Juliette, who was the same age as Maisie, was spending a fortnight&#039;s break with Maisie and her sisters. Of course, there…</p>

When she wanted to go to the toilet in the bar Linda realised they were going to miss the last bus home if they didn&#039;t leave now. So they ran to the bus stop, jumped in and drove of. It was a 25–minute drive and she was getting more desperate each second. Though it felt she was going to have the urine pour out of her mouth soon she held on until the bus came to their stop. Linda also mentioned she had to pee badly but Ann knew she was worse. Linda had gone to the toilet…</p>

The sign said the nearest public toilet was at Nightingale Road. I knew where that was, but, it was half a mile in the opposite direction from home.

This is another real life experience from me :)
When I had finished cleaning up after my first accident, I was still pretty confused... I mean, I&#039;m not supposed to wet my pants when I&#039;m almost 20 years, how could such an odd thing be the best turn–on ever? I still haven&#039;t figured that one out, but I stopped bothering. It&#039;s the best feeling ever, I don&#039;t care if I can&#039;t explain it as long as I love it!
Anyway, I had two full days alone still, and it&#039;s not often I get the opportunity to be alone like this. Also, with school over for the week and no particular homework I needed to care about, I had nothing to do…</p>

My first experience with pee fun was when I was younger. I woke up at about 7am and lay there for a while as it was Saturday and I didn&#039;t have to be anywhere. After 5 minutes I was hit with a sudden urge to pee that made me cross my legs together under the sheets; however the urge went away as quickly as it came and I fell asleep again.
I woke again half an hour later by an even bigger urge to pee as I had ignored the first one. Carefully but quickly I climbed out of bed but as I stood up some pee squirted out, enough to make a large coin sized patch on my panties. I managed to stop the flow and…</p>

Today had been the concert that she and Jason had been waiting for, and an awesome concert it turned out to be, with one of the greatest rock bands of all time on their recent tour. Lauren had had 2 large cokes, as well as some of Jason&#039;s water, and was now regretting many of her other decisions of the day as well. For one, she absolutely refused to use the porta potties at the concert, and now that they were sitting in the parking lot, waiting for the line of cars to move, she knew it would be a very long ride home. The ride was set to be nearly an hour back to her house, and even more if they went to Jason…</p>

When I got home after college Eve and Ann were waiting for me in the living room. They had put a blanket on the floor and told me I had to stand on it while I peed my jeans. I felt so turned on. I had just come home, with my coat and backpack still on and I could wet my pants now. I didn&#039;t hesitate, without taking anything off I stepped on the blanket and slightly spread my legs. Ann said something like, &#039;Oh my God, she is going to do it completely dressed, with even her backpack on,&#039; and then I relaxed. I felt it coming soon enough. It erupted against my panties, making it jet back at…</p>

        <p class="card-text">I have been interested in wetting for quite some time, been watching all kinds of sites on the Internet where girls wet themselves, and really enjoyed it a lot. I don&#039;t know how or when it started, I&#039;ve seen some girls showing signs of desperation every now and then when I&#039;m out, so I guess that&#039;s what triggered it for me. But I had never even considered doing it myself, until one lucky day when it just happened. (English is not my first language, I&#039;m sorry for any spelling mistakes or incorrect words that might appear in the text, but I hope you will get what I mean anyway.)
Since this is my first story I&#039;m posting, I thought that I&#039;d start with trying to describe how I look– from my experience most people…</p>

At work we have a strict policy. You can surf and mail work related and mail privately as well if it doesn&#039;t take up to much work time. Porn is strictly forbidden. As head of the IT department I had to check this from time to time. All Internet pages visited were logged on both who visited and how long they stayed if they were not in the approved list. I checked the log twice a week and if a site was clearly work related I added it to the list immediately. If it was on the edge of work related but not in violation of work codes (porn) I added it to a second list where the maximum visit…</p>

The next day my parents were going to a wine shop to get estimates on the worth of the wine. They were going with my grandparents and were planning on making a day out of it. I stayed behind and went into the secret area. When I was in the cellar I heard the doorbell and it was Monica. I opened the door from the inside and told her to come in through my living room. When she was with me she asked me why I wanted her to come in that way. I told her I didn&#039;t want anyone to find out about this secret place, so as few doors as we needed had to be used. The only door that opened inwards was my room; the…</p>

Sophie&#039;s bladder throbbed insistently. She ignored it and took another pull on her glass of Chablis. Sophie had other, more pressing matters on her mind, such as her hard earned career crashing to the ground. All her efforts destroyed in an instant, and all because of one damn picture. The image flashed back into her mind again as she squirmed slightly in her chair. All those frills, all that lace, and those two shiny stilettos with that huge ... Sophie again tilted the glass, but the image in her head could not be banished.
Sophie Cl&#039;risseau had flown to England four years ago to study English and Business Studies at South Bank University. With finances running low, Sophie had…</p>
