        <p class="card-text">&#039;Oh fucking GOD it&#039;s too fucking HOT today,&#039; thought Summer as she walked down the street with her friend.
&quot;Yeah it is,&quot; her friend Mandy replied. Summer&#039;s brain stopped for a second before she realized that she was thinking out loud.
&quot;So what are we going to do?&quot; Summer asked, her long blonde hair falling almost seductively over her face, sweat dripping from her shoulders down under her tank top, making her 36 Cs glisten under the hot sun. The only thing on her that wasn&#039;t sweaty was her toned, tan legs, which looked especially sexy in her short pink &amp; white striped satin basketball shorts. For being 25 she definitely looked like she could still be in high school and yet would get any guy&#039;s testosterone…</p>

        <p class="card-text">My First (and best ever) Experience
My name is Julia. Though I&#039;m still in high school, since I&#039;m now 18, I feel liberated, in that now I can share my experiences with others. This story is about my first experience, when I first learned that peeing and watching others pee was such a turn–on for me.
Though I like boys, I like peeing with other girls more than anything else in the world, and in that aspect, I guess I&#039;m somewhat of a bisexual. This story is told in the third person. I chose to write it this way so that I could include every event that took place, since I wasn&#039;t in the same room as some of the other girls when they peed.
Chloe, Claire, Julia, Ashley and Dani were all going over to Eliza&#039;s house…</p>

        <p class="card-text">A month has passed since the holding contest, and Elizabeth had forgotten about her suspicions that peeing herself sexually arouses her sister Alyssa. That time, while she was peeing her clothes sitting on the toilet, she would&#039;ve sworn that Alyssa was touching herself. But as the days passed by, she began to discard that idea, thinking that it was only her imagination, until something happened that reminded her of those suspicions.
Yesterday they were alone at their mother&#039;s house playing cards, drinking tea and eating crackers. Once during the game Elizabeth felt the need to pee, but she ignored it because the game was getting interesting, and later the urge passed. When the game was over, they took the…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Oh no, I woke up too late!
Glanced at the clock, quarter past eight
I hurried into my pink panties and short skirt
Covered up my C cup titties with a tight shirt
Grabbed a quick bite and drink
Already need to pee, but no time to I think
I rush quickly out the door
Already getting desperate for sure
I made it to the bus stop just in time
Got another soda, this one lemon &amp; lime
I let my blonde hair fall down
So beautiful all the other girls cried and frowned
I felt my bladder start to fill up
Hoping I could make it to my bus stop
So thirsty I had to drink another one
Crossing my legs now, this should be fun
Wriggling my legs while sitting on the bus
Hoping to not wet myself and make a fuss

        <p class="card-text">A few months ago my friend Melinda had given me a cigarette lighter. When she gave it to me I didn&#039;t smoke, so I thought it was a little weird. I guess because it led me to my first cigarette, I was not complaining– just curious. Why would she give such an odd gift?
I got the answer today.
Yesterday, Melinda and I were at the picnic table at school. We were just talking and gossiping as usual. As she did everyday, she opened the secret pocket in her book bag and pulled out a cigarette. She walked down to the &quot;smokers ditch&quot; and puffed away. As always, I followed her. As usual I seemed out of place in the smokers ditch. All of the others were Punks and Heads, the few that were lucky to have somehow gotten…</p>

Our bladders we&#039;d been filling by the chimney without care, In hopes that even St. Nicholas our pants could not spare;
Then we&#039;d nestled down all snug in our bed, While visions of sexy accidents danced in our heads;
And mamma in her panties and I in my cap, Had just settled in, but for much more than a winter&#039;s nap;
When out on the lawn there arose such a clatter, Our hands sprang to our pants stop the leaking from our bladders;
Away to the window we flew like a flash, And stood crossing our legs while we threw up the sash;
The moon on my wife&#039;s breasts, which were as white as snow, Gave the…</p>

Her roommates, with whom she had been good friends with since childhood, had all travelled back home for the holidays. Ramona would be left all alone in their vast apartment for three lonely weeks. On this particular day Ramona found her self parked in front of the television, reclining on the couch and enjoying her first real free time in months. Her peace was shortly interrupted by the twinge of nature calling her to empty her bladder. Ramona thought about getting up, but her favorite show was on. It could wait for now.

She had taken an interest in the country and the culture from travel documentaries on TV, and recently she had begun taking lessons in speaking Japanese.
We decided to meet one evening after work to decide. We would discuss the matter over a few pale ales, persuading each other with pictures from brochures and well–reasoned arguments. She thought Vegas was tacky and decadent (exactly the point, I thought). I thought Japan would be too…</p>

After a while, we were already deeply into the subject and had dropped in passing some information about the people we had met on our way. In one of my mails I had answered her question whether I knew people in Europe who were into watersports, too, in writing her that I had made very few such acquaintances. Actually, all I remembered was a summer I had passed in France working on a farm, a while ago. It was a small hamlet with just a farm, two houses and a small chapel in a picturesque landscape of small mountains and green valleys. Nice place to be on holidays,…</p>

Doctor Annabel Hart. The pretty young redhead&#039;s green eyes sparkled as she stared in amazement at the shingle hanging outside her office. She had thought, more than once, that this day would never come. Still, she had persevered, working long hours to support her schooling and even longer hours to pass medical school. The sleepless nights and heavy schedule had granted Annabel her most intense desire, but at the price of any social life. In fact she had no friends outside the stodgy little medical school she had attended. She thought it was worth it. Social opportunities would come when she…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Nikki and Tyler had not had as much time to spend together as Nikki wanted. She had been working hard and had been tired after work and Tyler had had to work late many nights. So by the weekend Nikki was ready to close out the whole world and concentrate only on each other.
Friday night was a wash because Nikki and Tyler were so tired they just popped in a DVD and watched a movie until they fell asleep. However, Nikki woke up energetic and horny. Tyler was still sleeping when she climbed out of bed. She skipped her usual morning potty stop and held it until she stepped into the shower. She waited to turn on the water and stood there naked savoring her full bladder. She ran a finger between her vaginal lips…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Alyssa, Elizabeth and Michelle were three sisters from the oldest to the youngest, who had been chatting and drinking at a bar. The beers went by and the conversation was so interesting that they hadn&#039;t remembered to go to the bathroom, but finally they realised that their bladders were dangerously full. The first to notice it was the middle one.
Elizabeth: &quot;Girls, I&#039;ll be back in a minute, I need to use the toilet.&quot;
Michelle: &quot;Wait, I&#039;ll go with you, I need it too.&quot;
Alyssa: &quot;Hey, don&#039;t leave me here alone, you aren&#039;t the only ones that have several beers inside!&quot;
Elizabeth: &quot;Ok, but I called it first, so one of you&#039;ll have to wait here to watch our stuff while the other one comes with me.&quot;
Alyssa: …</p>

        <p class="card-text">Lee lies still, awake enough to know she needs to pee, but not enough to actually do anything about it. She watches as her friend Donna stirs in her sleep, moans, and goes quiet again. She and Donna are new friends; they have not yet learned the intimacies of the other&#039;s mannerisms and habits. Donna&#039;s covers are kicked back and Lee can see Donna&#039;s hand resting between her legs, where dark curls peek from under the crotch of her white panties. Donna&#039;s hand moves, ever so slightly, and she arches her back, just a bit.
Another moan. Lee wonders if the hand has anything to do with the moan. It doesn&#039;t surprise the 23–year–old blond to realize she, and apparently her nipples, like the idea that it does. She had…</p>

        <p class="card-text">The next few days went by rather uneventfully. Neither Carol nor I wanted to make a mistake in our relationship, so we were very, very cautious. In fact, aside from the fact that we continued to sleep in the same bed, our relationship went back to what it had been in the past. I had arrived on Saturday evening and all the big revelations had taken place before midnight Sunday.
While it was uneventful in terms of any wetting together or other sex play, we did get around a bit. We went swimming in Lake Coeur d&#039;Alene, borrowed a friend&#039;s sailboat for a day, spent one whole day shopping and Carol tried to teach me how to play golf – sorry, but that&#039;s just not going to happen! Through it all there was, for me at…</p>
