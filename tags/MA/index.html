        <p class="card-text">Heather hesitantly stepped out of her car and walked towards the gym entrance. She felt nervous and excited at the same time. She was finally addressing her weight concerns with this three–month program. A 5&quot;9 natural blonde with a busty build, she had been the talk of her high school in her younger years. Now 28 years old and a manager at the local Walmart, she had seen her weight skyrocket nearly twenty pounds in past eighteen months, following a bitter break–up with a boyfriend of three years. Despite the weight gain, she still got plenty of lustful stares from men when she walked around the store.Heather showed her ID to the brunette at the front desk and was directed to Training Room B, down the hall on…</p>

Note: This story contains Female Desperation &amp; Wetting, and Masturbation. I first discovered the pleasurable aspects of wetting my knickers while at university. It all began when I became friendly with a group of girls in the folk music club and began to frequent the various pubs in the area. For some reason cider was our preferred drink, being cheap and strong – despite its well known diuretic properties.When I first joined the group I was amused by the frequent references to ending up with &quot;cider legs&quot; if one of us drank too much. I assumed this to mean drunk, but was to find out otherwise, though our frequent visits to the ladies loo and the fact that I knew that…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Two weeks had passed since the eventful sleepover at Jamie&#039;s house. Both girls had grown to need the others touch. This had led to some incredibly risky lovemaking outside their homes– at the movies, in the quiet corners of the public library, even the bathroom stalls at school. The risk of getting discovered turned them on immensely and they had barely escaped some close calls. Jamie received a phone call from Misty the day after the wetting incident at the bar. Being the experimental type and a closet wetter for many years, Misty was dying for more fun with Jamie and Kiran. However, getting to Mistys apartment during her free hours was a difficult task for the two schoolgirls living under the close…</p>

Note: This story contains Female Desperation &amp; Wetting, Bed Wetting, and &amp; Masturbation. Work has been hell recently. I have really been under pressure to complete a major project to get some complex documentation complete and the whole thing has been dogged by problems. As a result I have had sleepless nights and have felt really stressed out, the eventual result of which proved rather embarassing. At the end of a particularly bad week my friends persuaded me to go out for a drink on Friday night. I arrived home more relaxed and rather drunk, though not excessively so, took a quick shower and tumbled into bed. Around 6.30, half asleep and confused, I realized something was…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Sharon&#039;s semester had gone as well as she could have possibly expected. She was doing well in all her second year classes and had good grades going into her final exams. Her Psychology 241 class was by far the most interesting course she had ever taken. She had her first ever sexual experience with Kathy, her professor, but it seemed like a one–time deal. Sharon had stayed behind after class a number of times; approaching her professor after all the other students had left. Last week, she had even gone to her during office hours with several questions, seductively dressed in a skimpy workout shirt and tight shorts in obvious desperation after a bottle of water and two beers, but hadn&#039;t gotten any response from…</p>

&quot;Sure, you know where it is,&quot; said Julia, standing aside to let her past. Elizabeth took the stairs 2 at a time, holding her crotch as she went. Julia followed her up. Elizabeth darted into the bathroom leaving the door wide open. She hiked up her skirt and yanked down her panties just in time.

My chief attraction is my neat figure. Otherwise I am average in almost all areas. I have shoulder length brown to mousy hair. I am about average height, and would never win a beauty contest.

I still did well, but allowed myself to have a social life as well.
I still wasn&#039;t a big house–party person. Those things are just annoying to me. A bunch of my friends were having a dorm party though, with one of those giant jugs of vodka and a couple of gallons of Tampico. I was pumped.

Mandy looked at her reflection in the mirror for the umpteenth time that morning. She had to make sure that she looked perfect. It was an important day for her– she had to make sure she looked as attractive as possible. She was dressed in a tight white t–shirt with no bra, showing off her perfectly round breasts and erect nipples. She wore a tight denim skirt, short enough to reveal her light pink cotton panties when she bent over. She wished she was brave enough to wear her favourite pair of skinny jeans, but couldn&#039;t bring herself to risk the consequences of that just yet.

In a half–hour she wakes up and we start talking. Her name is Lori and she is very easy to talk to, and we were having a good time until I see her start to squirm. Lori admits she really needs to pee and gets up to ask the driver to stop, then comes back with a very worried look on her face.
We talk some more, but Lori is getting frantic, and starts to bounce in her seat. And I am getting very turned on. Finally she reaches her limit, &quot;Oh…</p>

        <p class="card-text">The Seattle city center traffic was so bad that it was often joked that it caused people to become junkies and then kill themselves. It made sense as the city was famously known for being the center of the early 90’s grunge scene, a short–lived but significant era in rock music, with bands such as Nirvana, Alice in Chains, Pearl Jam, and Soundgarden. Two of the more influential grunge bands, Nirvana and Alice in Chains abruptly ended following the suicides of their lead singers in the mid 90’s.
Mandy, currently stuck in the same afternoon Seattle traffic, sighed deeply as her frustration mounted behind the wheel of her 2004 Volkswagen Golf. She was on her way home from work, a commute that was no more than 20…</p>

Rachel threw the last of her papers and other items into her briefcase and muttered &quot;Thank fuck for that!&quot; This was swiftly followed by &quot;Ow! Shit!&quot; as, slamming the lid shut, she trapped the fleshy part of the heel of her hand between the lid and the base. She sucked the wound ruefully; although she hadn&#039;t drawn blood, she expected that there would be a blood blister there later. God, what a day it had been; what a week, in fact. It had been all about stress, pressure, with a liberal helping of frustration thrown in for good measure; she was glad it was finally over, for the weekend, at least. But who knew what…</p>

This is another real life experience from me, about what I did right after my previous story, &quot;The camouflaged wetting&quot; =)
I had tortured my bladder two times today already, and I didn&#039;t know how much more it could handle. After stepping out of the shower where I cleaned up after trying my camouflage kit out, I needed to pee really often, like every 30–40 minutes, even though it wasn&#039;t much. My bladder was very weak, but I still had the evening and night for further experiments. Now that I had found this new interest, I couldn&#039;t let any opportunity go to waste. I was hoping that if I didn&#039;t torture my bladder at…</p>

Marge and George were decorating their bedroom. The old wallpaper had been stripped off, the paintwork rubbed down, and they had been to purchase the new paint and paper. When they returned, and pulled onto the driveway, Marge went to unlock the front door while George got the goods out of the car. As he stood up he was surprised to see a young lady in obvious great discomfort approaching him. She only took small steps and yet was hurrying, clutching her abdomen.
&quot;Excuse me,&quot; she said to…</p>

        <p class="card-text">I&#039;m a 31–year–old slim blonde math teacher at this local high school. I remember a really memorable experience I had a while back. When the classes were done for the entire year, the students had to take a math exam this one particular day, and after 3 hours every student had finished the test and left the school. By that point, I had to pee kinda badly. 
During the test, I think I had drunk at least a litre and a half of water, and I didn&#039;t get a chance to use the washroom that morning either because I overslept. Plus, I had drunk around 2 large cups of coffee that morning as well. But I decided to hold it in because I had a lot of exams to grade and such. Even though I could&#039;ve taken the exams with me and…</p>
