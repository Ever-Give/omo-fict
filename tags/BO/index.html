Here she was again, outside the apartment bathroom with a morning bladder full to bursting. Inside of course, was her roommate Ashley.
&quot;Ashley! Open the door damn it. You can primp yourself later it&#039;s an emergency.&quot;
&quot;Hold on,&quot; Ashley said.
Geeze, that girl can&#039;t hold it more than 5 minutes before she is pissing all over herself. Ashley thought.
Damn her, damn her, Sam thought to herself again. Ashley did this every morning. Sam tried to wake up before Ashley but sometimes she timed it wrong. What did she do to get stuck with a roommate like her? The pretty girl and the average girl, Sam knew what everyone thought of her and Ashley. Sam herself was not ugly…</p>

Mandy&#039;s life had changed dramatically in the past 2 months. Her boyfriend, Doug had recently asked her to move in with him and she had happily accepted. Doug&#039;s client base was growing rapidly and the law firm had gotten very busy. With the busier workdays, there had not been as much time for wet fun at work. It had gotten so busy that Doug had to hire a junior lawyer to help him keep up with the workload.
Mandy had been forced to make adjustments as well. Last month, Doug had told her he would have to hire a secretary more experienced in the law field, because of the huge call back list of clients he…</p>

Mandy had an unusual relationship with her boss and lover, Doug. Outside of work, he was everything she could ask for in a man; he was kind, passionate, and extremely fun to be with. However, the situation was a little different at work. He had requested that their relationship should be kept a secret for now, because it looked unprofessional and he was fearful of getting of being perceived as someone who took advantage of women who worked for him. He asked her to continue to address him as Mr. Welsh at work and not to show any public displays of affection at the office. He promised her that he would tell…</p>

Things were going well between Tanja and me. I was madly in love with her and I could feel that she had a growing liking to me as well. We did have our differences though. I wanted nothing more than to be with Tanja all the time. She was absolutely amazing in every way. She was the woman I had only seen in my dreams until now.
However, Tanja was more non–committal and tended to shy away from any discussions of getting to know each other better. She seemed to want to keep her options open and rolled with life as it came, taking in all of each and every experience. I had told her that I was okay with…</p>

Lisa looked up at Christy confused and Christy smirked at her, saying, &quot;If you&#039;re going to be wetting your pants like a baby, then we need to treat you like one! I want you to go to the store and buy some diapers and a pacifier. Also buy a pair of handcuffs.&quot;
Lisa threw her arms in the air and looked down at her soaking wet jeans. Christy smiled and said, &quot;You&#039;re going just like you are now.&quot; She looked up at the clock. &quot;Hurry, baby, I&#039;m timing you.&quot; Christy lay on the couch and turned on the television.

        <p class="card-text">Ellen was a colleague of mine at a large advertising agency. She and I were competing for the same promotion. The bosses at the agency made it clear that the winner got the job, and the loser had to leave.
Ellen is a bright and attractive woman in her late 30&#039;s who was completely driven by work and success. So far as anyone knew, she had no private life. Her dress was stylish, but her in–office demeanor very prim. Ellen also never admitted mistake, nor showed any remorse. Her goal was to succeed by any means necessary. We did not work together, and our relationship was limited to saying hello to one another in the hallways.
For six solid months Ellen and I competed for the coveted vice–president&#039;s position.…</p>

It had been a rough week at work and Nikki was ready for two days of relaxation and time with Tyler. To prepare herself she had been drinking lots of water all afternoon. Of course, she had had to pee several times in order not to embarrass herself at the office, but that was OK. She knew she was well hydrated and that she now only needed to drink a little to fill her bladder enough to make her hot and intensify her horniness.
She stopped in the staff kitchen on her way out of the office to fill up her water bottle and then headed out to the car. On the way home she fantasized about what she might do with Tyler tonight.…</p>

Part Two
The polished hardwood floor of the ballroom glistened; the lights from the chandeliers overhead were reflected in the varnish of the wood. Spacious, the room stretched from one end of the old mansion to the other, high ceilings adorned with artwork, sculptures embedded in the royal columns that supported the old roof. A long bar, covered in black velvet formed the right border of the room, in the back, a double doorway led to the hallway of the old mansion. Before the doorway, still in the ballroom, a small antique table with an old lamp on it and a set of ledgers…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Alexandra had just finished a long day: court in the morning and clients in the afternoon. She just wanted to get home, get out of her clothes, and relax. Alexandra was wearing her &quot;court clothes,&quot; a stylish dark gray business suit, skirt, jacket, and white blouse. She topped it off with a pair of pantyhose and very high heels. That morning, Alexandra felt the need to wear something to hold in her stomach. Over her pantyhose was a long leg, high–waist panty girdle. As the day wore on, her girdle seemed to get a lot tighter. She really wanted to go into the ladies room, and tear it off. At the same time, she really liked the way it made her look.
It was after six when the final client left. Alexandra went…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Thy was tied up. She was tied up well. She couldn&#039;t wriggle free. When the men had left before she had tried. They were behind a cop style mirror, where she couldn&#039;t see them, but they could watch every move she made.
Her wrists were tied behind her, fastened to her ankles. There was a rope around her knees, pulling them apart, and she was slightly suspended from above, where ropes under her arms held her up. Her body was arched back, pushing out her breasts, and her legs were apart enough that Thy knew the men would be looking at her pussy.
Occasionally she heard murmurs from behind the glass, and caught a word of English here and there. Thy was Japanese, and was in the country on a student exchange program…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Jennifer struggled against her bonds, but there was no escape. Sweating slightly from her excursions she lay there, panting and stared up from her living room floor. She was bored of doing dishes every day and had wanted more excitement in her life, so her husband suggested joining the local swingers club. She was intrigued, but she hadn&#039;t quite expected this. The meal had gone down great. She had cooked a grand feast for George her husband, and Tom and his wife Pat. There had been lots of wine on offer, which admittedly she had consumed quite heavily to calm her nerves.
Now her husband had whisked Pat up to the bedroom and Jennifer had been left handcuffed on the carpet. What&#039;s more she was beginning to wish…</p>
