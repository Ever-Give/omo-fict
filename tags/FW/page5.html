        <p class="card-text">It was just my luck that the night before we where to do the shopping for our house party, there was the biggest snowfall for years. Then to make matters worse, the strong winds had caused the snow to drift. Although the snow ploughs had made the main roads passable, the remainder of the thoroughfares were blocked to cars, even off–road vehicles. Ian, my husband, had dug paths along with the neighbors, so people could walk. But the nearest town was 6 miles away.
After a lot of thought we decided on a plan of action, the nearest main road was one and a half miles across the fields. We decided to make a fun thing out of it and walk to the main road, then phone for a taxi.
Then all dressed up in sweaters, wind…</p>

        <p class="card-text">It was one of those days where I just felt randy, and it was about 4 in the afternoon. Time to get the mail. I went to the mailbox at my apartment complex, when I saw the prettiest girl walking along to the entrance door of my building. She was wearing a denim mini and a cute pink short sleeved shirt, so right away my mind began dancing with the idea of how lovely it would be to have a little of my kind of fun with her. As I thought of this, standing there at the mailbox, I let just a tiny dribble go in my pink boy cut panties, making sure none showed through my jeans.
I headed back to the apartment, and who was standing at the door to my neighbors but the pretty girl. She was kind of dancing about strangely …</p>

She knows that is was her qualifications that got her the job, but looking okay is no disadvantage, right? Her hair is dark and curly and gathered in a ponytail, she is wearing a grey suit – a jacket and a straight skirt – above a white blouse, and her make–up is very discreet. She is a proper lady of twenty–five, single, who keeps a friendly distance to her suitors at work.
Julia straightens her skirt and drinks a couple of mugs of water from the cooler. It&#039;s Friday. She&#039;s ready for the meeting.
Afterwards they are served sandwiches and…</p>

Kristi woke up, her normal routine, on a Thursday morning. She took a shower, dressed up in a skirt (it was an unusually warm weather, reaching 90 degrees just south of San Francisco), took a drink, and took a quick pee before heading out. Working at a Sprint store, which was only half a mile walk through some redwood trees, she got there, avoiding the sun as much as she could since she was feeling hot. She headed there, did her usual work, answering phone calls and helping customers, and drank some water. Quickly feeling her bladder fill up from…</p>

        <p class="card-text">In my previous story, I explained how I had my first–ever real accident when I was incredibly desperate and sneezed. I had decided to &quot;hold it&quot; on purpose, and had become so desperate that when I sneezed, I peed my pants.
But although I didn&#039;t really enjoy peeing my pants, I really liked the feeling of being desperate, so I decided to do it again.
About a month after the incident described above, I once again found myself needing the toilet during our first fifteen–minute break period, and denying myself that relief because I wanted to be desperate again. I&#039;ve found that having a full bladder is extremely pleasurable for me, and I often put off going to the toilet for long periods so that I can experience…</p>

        <p class="card-text">This is part two of my story. I almost didn&#039;t send it in. After reading my first installment on the Web I sort of panicked, I was afraid that someone could figure out whom I really am and that it might cause problems for me. I was also a bit embarrassed to read such intimate details about my life on a forum that basically anyone with a computer could read. Strangely enough, it was Carol who persuaded me to send in this next part. She read the first one after I told her it was going to be posted and wanted to read the rest of my impressions of that week. Now that some time has gone by and I&#039;ve thought about it I think it would be pretty hard for someone to track me down, and even if it is embarrassing at times…</p>

It was a hot summer day, near the end of July and all of Tyler&#039;s buds had deserted him for their summer jobs. Bored and full of pent–up desires (solitary masturbation just isn&#039;t enough), Tyler donned a hot pair of swim trunks under his clothes, and headed over to the local pool. He was keen on all those dripping, scantily clothed females. Oh, how he envied the male lifeguards that worked there.
He scanned the edge of the pool, looking for a friendly face. Seeing no one he recognized, he then turned his focus to the vacant poolside lounge chairs. He finally spotted an empty…</p>

Still two hundred miles from home, she decided to rest rather than to risk an accident. She smiled to herself at the word accident; there were several kinds, not all of them unpleasant.
She parked, grabbed her bags and went to check in. Her tight jeans left little room for her full bladder, so she unbuttoned her top button to ease the pressure. Being this obvious was part of the thrill. She put her bags down at the counter and smiled at the receptionist, a young fair girl in beige pants and a white blouse.
— Do you have a room for me?
— Sure.…</p>

Her breasts flirted with the thin silky material of her blouse, tight against her nipples. She had no need of a bra and she liked the looks she got without one. Her long shapely legs looked even more remarkable under the tight mini. Her panties played peek–a–boo with her as she turned in the mirror, her perfect ass occasionally visible under the dress as she moved. Pretty short! She decided it was just right.

It was Saturday and rain brushed at the window.
A murmur of voices from the street idled through the glass, diffuse in the traffic noise. They drew his attention more than the TV and gradually his focus shifted to them, striving to separate male from female, even to catch an essence of what they said. This was not idle neighbor gossip, no. There was earnestness about the voices– instructing, planning, and plotting even.
Salesmen!

Darren was a distinguished quest, and therefore was to have a pair of women for the night. Darren gaped at all of the women, and slowly walked around the rooms to find the ones he liked best. Finally, Darren pointed at two slender, tall women who were among a group talking softly together on the patio, sipping at tall pink lemonades. Cara…</p>

I&#039;m a truck driver.
That doesn&#039;t mean I&#039;m fat and sloppy – the girls say I look OK at thirty–one, and I have had my share of relationships. But spending most of my life in transit makes for a lousy home life, so I&#039;m single.
I was on an overnight ferry to the continent, going to Hamburg with a load of machinery. I don&#039;t drink much on these trips, but that doesn&#039;t keep me from spending the night in pubs or the discotheque.
She was sitting by herself. I had seen her with two friends, but they were flirting energetically with a bunch of economists from Croydon (they were very loud) and this girl was not included. I didn&#039;t exactly…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Karen rose early from her sleep, feeling the need to urinate. She loved this feeling, being on the edge of desperation, and considered going back to sleep. &#039;No,&#039; she decided, she better get up, because she wasn&#039;t sure she could hold it until morning, and her boyfriend was over. Even though he knew of her fetish, they had never really practiced it together before, because she was shy. Karen tried to sit up and realized her ankles were chained to the bed. She rolled over and nuzzled her boyfriend, but Josh was already awake. She could feel him watching her in the dark. &quot;Honey, where&#039;s the key?&quot; but he just chuckled and asked why. Karen told him, but he refused. &quot;I&#039;m going to make your deepest fantasy come true,…</p>

        <p class="card-text">The sun was hot and the sky clear when Maryann set out in the morning. She carried a small lunch and a towel. Today she had decided to go off by herself and spend a quiet, private day in the forest. She had lived in these hills all her life and she knew every path and stream.
At eighteen, Maryann was in full bloom. She wore close–fitting shorts and a man&#039;s white shirt with the shirttails tied across her bare stomach. With one part of her mind Maryann knew where she was headed and what she planned to do when she got there, but with another part of her mind she pretended she didn&#039;t know at all and was just out for a good long walk.
On up into the hills she wandered, following paths she had known from early…</p>

        <p class="card-text">The automatic door of the van hissed with air escaping loudly from the hydraulics, and creaked on old bearings as it slowly opened. The cool night air rushed in to greet the passengers as they stepped out of the vehicle in front of the hotel. Grasping the chrome handrail, they each stepped onto the black stair platform and then onto the asphalt parking lot. The high–rise building was new, the crowning jewel of the airport hotels, rising 15 stories into the clear night sky, suites along the very top floors and well appointed rooms below. Twin miniature man–made lakes were in front, framed by the granite entrance, a pair of palms framing the lakes. The blurred words &quot;HOTEL SHUTTLE&quot; were visible, reflecting in…</p>
