        <p class="card-text">It was 1960 when Vicky climbed aboard a Greyhound Bus affiliate that connected her hometown to the main line. It was the cheapest way for Vicky to get to Philadelphia where she had acquired a job writing copy for an advertising agency. It was a Friday morning and she had to report Monday morning at 8:00AM sharp. With the help of her parents she had already arranged for lodging in Philly and she had an advance in cash from her daddy to last until she got her feet on the ground. It was the best she could do with her recent Baccalaureate Degree in English and she was very excited about her prospects. She couldn&#039;t imagine a better starting point.
Vicky was 22 years of age, 5 feet 6 inches tall, and 120 pounds of…</p>

        <p class="card-text">This is a story about my fianc&#039;, Eric and myself. We both have quite the wetting fetish and although this is a fictional story, similar things have happened to us before. Enjoy!
I knew there would definitely be some wetness that day because the traffic report warned of delays due to road construction on the highway. Before heading out we filled a cooler with bottles of water, cans of coke, and a few bottles of juice and iced tea since it was a rather hot day. Eric and myself are both freaks about staying hydrated and even if we have to go on a long road trip we don&#039;t hold off on the fluids. It&#039;s simply uncomfortable to be thirsty, and if it&#039;s only the two of us on the trip a little moisture never hurt anyone …</p>

Part One
Finally back at my hotel you hobble across the deserted lobby, hanging onto me. You&#039;re bent far forward, cute breasts thrust out. Your bladder is so, so very stretched out, aching, straining, bulging visibly in your abdomen in the visible inch of bare flesh between your shirt and the jean cutoffs.
And then the feeling in your little pussy, like a white hot knife blade pressing down from inside, that enormous quantity of pent up pee needing to get out of your little burning pee hole. Your whole body is trembling. Your inner bare thighs and the crotch of your denim shorts are wet, your free hand straying unashamedly to clutch your crotch and squeeze. The desk clerk looks up and stares, but you&#039;re…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Earlier today I had my first wetting experience (Playing Sick), and I can&#039;t stop thinking about it! I remember the warmth forming between my legs. I remember orgasming like I never have before as the pee flooded my panties. It was the most orgasmic experience of my life, but I needed to make it better. Last time I peed on the toilet. This time I would need to do something more exotic!
I lay back on my bed, again trying to study for my test. After all, I do have a test today. I tried to think of equations, but all I could think of was the sight of that wonderful dark patch growing in my panties earlier today. My panties were white and the pee was wet; it felt so good. It even flooded my bottom as I sat on the…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Jenna arrived at my condo at 2:00 pm to watch a football game. Jenna and I worked together for a couple of years, but never dated. She was the classiest and best–looking female in the company, and was widely known for being unapproachable. When she arrived, dark–haired Jenna was wearing a black t–shirt and a pair of designer jeans that laced up in the front like a pair of tennis shoes. After watching a few minutes of the game and drinking a beer, she got a very odd look on her face.
&quot;Jenna, is something the matter?&quot;
&quot;Well, I was with a friend named Erick before I came here. We were drinking at a bar for a couple of hours. I wanted to leave, but he wanted to talk in his car. As soon as we got in his car, be…</p>

She was in bed, with alarm bells sounding in her mind. Her hand went down to her panty crotch to confirm what her waking mind already knew. She had wet the bed!
She had been dreaming that she had been out walking her new baby son Mark around the countryside in his pushchair. She had somehow gotten lost, and was unsure about which way to go to find the quickest way home. Above all she really needed to wee but was unsure of the length of time it would be till she could make it all the way home.

After a couple of beers she had felt the need to go, but deep in conversation she had put it off. As she finally headed for the porta loos she realized the queues had grown in proportion with her need. Sighing, she took her place at the end of the line.
Becky was a short girl of twenty–nine, dressed in very tight white pants and a blue tee shirt. Her body was round in the hips, but she had a narrow waist, although her belly echoed the roundness of her bottom. With short brown hair and a nice smile she usually made friends fast.

I&#039;m twirling around, somewhat slowly, finishing a decidedly amateur version of a camel back spin, the announcer blaring that &quot;open ice is over&quot;. The other skaters begin to clear the ice, the overprotective mothers hovering over their next superstar wunderkind child, the harried parents yelling at their hopefully NHL destined little boy, the romantic couples skating a few extra laps lazily around the rink, arm in arm, seemingly oblivious to the announcers call. The dusk sky slowly rolls in, yet it&#039;s still somewhat warm out. The rink, a public outdoors facility, shuts down early on Fridays for maintenance. I&#039;m still amazed they kept it running today. While the ice was a little slippery,…</p>

The strong smell of chlorine fills the air. The concrete walls echo with the screaming of children, teens and nervous parents. It&#039;s two o&#039;clock and my shift is over. I survey the scene on this busy Saturday; take the empty water bottle with me as my replacement shows up. As I climb down the ladder from the watch chair I&#039;m aware how badly I need to use the bathroom. No breaks today, another lifeguard called in sick, and it&#039;s been four hours without a pee break, and with as much water as I had, I&#039;m about to burst. My red lifeguard bathing suit fits tightly over my 5&#039; 6&quot; body, my long dark hair tied up in a bun. I fidget as I sign out, the tight fabric of my bathing suit clinging to my…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Jenny, as the only women driver who worked for the coach company, always liked to arrive early, both to avoid any criticism in a male dominated job, and to give herself time to get ready before taking her coach out. Hence she wasn&#039;t happy when the yard manager was waiting as she arrived.
&quot;Change of plan, I&#039;m afraid, Jenny,&quot; he greeted her. &quot;Bill has gone sick, so you&#039;ll have to do his job, it&#039;s urgent, there&#039;s nobody else here yet. The coach is outside ready, fuelled and everything, instructions on the wheel. Better get moving– you haven&#039;t got much time.&quot;
He pointed to a coach parked opposite and turned away with a parting &quot;Good girl, you&#039;ve saved my life!&quot; before Jenny had a chance to say anything. She…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Stacy switched gear and the car sped across in a frenzy. Her rapidly filling bladder was already giving distress signals. Stacy had very little time for her fashion show. She had a 45–minute drive ahead of her and she had no idea if she would ever reach the place in time. She hoped that she would. At the same time, she was very apprehensive. This was her first major show, and she was one of the girls who was selected, groomed and trained for the big show. She was part of a 30–member model team who were supposed to make their presence felt.
Stacy had just turned 18 a month ago. She felt like a woman when she thought about her age, but at the same time, her body betrayed her falsely. Stacy was a brunette, stood…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Emily and I had hit it off from the time we had first met at a political gathering. She had approached me to provide positive commentary on something I had said at the meeting. From then on, I could easily tell she was sucking up to me, praising my &quot;brilliance,&quot; but in such a delicious way!
We dated for a few weeks. I invited her over to my place for dinner, and she reciprocated at hers. There&#039;s a considerable age difference between us, so initially we engaged as &quot;friend and mentor.&quot; Then one weekend when we were out hiking in an isolated canyon, she turned to me and said coyly, &quot;I need a bathroom, but I really detest the idea of dropping my trousers in this buggy place. Would you be terribly offended if just…</p>

        <p class="card-text">After what had seemed like an interminable Friday of classes at the NYU Downtown Campus, Katie McDonald, a 21–year–old graduate student in political economics, neatly arranged her books and materials in her tote pack and strode confidently out toward Washington Square. During the walk, she exchanged pleasantries with her classmates Rita Kudner and Boyd Hamilton, though declined an invitation to a student sleepover at someone&#039;s parents&#039; house on the Upper East Side. Katie had other things in mind.
Nearing the park, Katie managed to disengage from Rita and Boyd, who were heading for the subway. She strode over to a bench on the west side of the park, straightened her medium–length navy blue skirt and India…</p>

        <p class="card-text">The most daring I have ever been was in July of this year. It was a Sunday afternoon, chilly but crisp and clear. I was sitting on the balcony of my apartment, drinking beer with my new flat mate, Anna. We were chatting away comfortably when she mentioned the time she had wet herself after a university pub–crawl. I was instantly aroused, and tipsy enough to press her for more details. Anna was very obliging, in no way guessing that she had inadvertently stepped right into the territory of my secret passion. Then she turned it round, and asked me when I last had an accident. I couldn&#039;t tiptoe round the issue, for the beer had made me alarmingly honest. I felt myself go bright red, and Anna, realizing straight…</p>
