        <p class="card-text">As a South African working in England, Sonia wanted to see her national team when they were touring, and she was delighted when one of her office colleagues, Tony, a dedicated rugby fan, offered to include her in the party he was organizing to the England v. South Africa match at Twickenham. Tony was a regular at Twickenham internationals, and the group followed his usual plan to avoid the worst of the crowds– travel by public transport, stop at a little–known pub, and then walk to the ground. As well as Tony and Sonia, there were two other couples, both about Tony&#039;s age, while Sonia was about ten years older. She was a tall, well–built, girl of 35, with short blonde hair, and was wearing a knee–length tweed…</p>

Part Two
This picks up where Part One left off, obviously. So if you haven&#039;t read that, scroll down and catch up on your reading. This part will make a teeny bit more sense, maybe not much, but some. This portion here contains a little bit of, shall we say, consensual roughness between the two imaginary lovers. If you&#039;re uncomfortable with that, move on. Or even if you don&#039;t think you like it, try reading it. Gosh, you know sometimes we&#039;re surprised at what we find out about ourselves.

&quot;I&#039;m totally serious. No more until we get home,&quot; I said. But looking down at your skirt, already soaked in various places, I knew I&#039;d never be able to tell if you were behaving.

        <p class="card-text">At the time it seemed the logical thing to do – but trying to persuade my wife was another matter!
We had been at the beach for a few hours already and after a couple of bottles of cool water, we both needed to pee badly. Trouble is, my wife isn&#039;t one for peeing in public – even in the sea – so she sat there fidgeting while we discussed what to do. There were basically three options. One – she could go into the sea and pee while pretending to swim or paddle or whatever it is people do when they pee in the sea. Two – we could leave the beach, return to the car and find a rest area nearby that had toilet facilities. Or three – she could pee where she was, sitting next to me, onto the towel that was still damp…</p>

        <p class="card-text">This fantasy was inspired by the recent postings on Wink 11.
It was a chilly autumn Saturday. Football season had ended two weeks ago, and the students from State U didn&#039;t have much to do. A gang of four senior girls decided to liven things up by having a beer–drinking contest.
Susan, a local, was what might be called the leader of their clique. Her companions were from different parts of the state. All were interested primarily in boys except for Sally, who secretly preferred girls. Sally and Gabriella were brunettes; Susan, a blonde and Theresa had auburn hair. They had the typical, budding physiques of young womanhood, average height and weight. Boys found them sexy in their tight jeans.
They lived in an…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Sandy&#039;s much increased bladder capacity allowed her to earn a remarkable 1430 points out of a possible 1600 on her SATs, permitting her admittance to a top–ranked ivy–league school. Her parents couldn&#039;t be prouder, and frankly, Sandy couldn&#039;t have been more pleased with herself for conquering her illness. Throughout the remainder of high school and the first two years of college, Sandy rarely missed any class on account of her bladder. There were still some days when her thirst would be too great and she would still need to leave occasionally, but those days were few and far between. She continued working on her kegel exercises, and only visited the toilet when absolutely necessary. Even when bursting, she…</p>

Ruth likes a bit of a drink, but recently, she has been drinking to excess, and has been losing friends. Ruth never stays in her own house, she tends to go out and go home with other people, usually her female friends but some guys too.
Now, not everyone is into watersports and for some reason, people have been throwing Ruth out of their house after she repeatedly wet herself. I was hearing stories for weeks of how Ruth has been wetting her pants, and letting them dry out instead of changing, and I tried desperately to find her for a while.

Lisa stared at the lines of cars, gray with soot and dirt, and then gazed at the mall off in the distance. Parking was difficult this time of year. A few weekends until Christmas, and everyone headed out for their holiday shopping, all intent on getting the latest toy or the latest fashion, cutting one another off, swearing at each other all in Christmas joy.

The doorbell rang and I knew it was the UPS delivery I had been expecting. I opened the door and was greeted by a rather pleasant looking female delivery driver. She smiled at me in a slightly nervous sort of way and let out a bit of a groan as she set down the rather large box of parts I had ordered for my Alfa Romeo Spider. She straightened up and still seemed a bit fidgety, as she held out her electronic clipboard for my signature.
At this point, I took a better look at her. She was about 5&#039;7&quot;, with long dark hair and sunglasses on. Being the better part of August, it was already at least 80–degrees outside and she was wearing her &#039;standard issue&#039; brown short sleeve shirt and…</p>

The beaches never emptied entirely on their island. Through her sunglasses, Rosemary looked up from her novel and admired the sunset. Another long, slow, beautiful day in paradise was coming to a close, and after nearly ten years she was finally beyond the too good to be true stage. It was true. She really lived here, and she really was a hero for the very reason she&#039;d been ostracized back home. She set the book down on her lap and pondered that thought once again.
Naturally, since she&#039;d stopped concentrating on the book, it wasn&#039;t long before Rosemary&#039;s attention…</p>

Jenny&#039;s first thought when she awoke was, I have to pee. The second was, &#039;Please don&#039;t stop fondling my pussy.&#039;
The significance of that second thought took some time to sink in. She was lying on her stomach with one leg drawn up, and a probing hand was stroking her from behind, parting her butt cheeks, sliding all the way up and down, catching her moisture, slipping inside her openings. But as she felt herself rise to orgasm she remembered. A small spurt of pee escaped her as she climaxed. She lay for a moment, just breathing. Then she felt arms embrace her and the pressure of breasts on her back. Slowly she turned and met Becky…</p>

It was a gorgeous day, simply no other way to put it. The sun was shining, the birds were singing, the air was warm and dry, with barely a cloud in the sky. It was the weekend, and the faire was the place to be! Games, rides, all sorts of fun! Everyone was there, including a girl named Amy. Amy was a darling, sweet girl. She was 5&#039;5, 110 pounds, dark just–below–shoulder–length brownish–black hair, beautiful smooth ivory skin, a face that had just the right…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Chloe looked so adorable standing there in the entrance of the County Fair, fishing around in her purse for money to buy tickets. Michael snuck up behind her and poked her lightly on the bottom. She spun around and her grabbed her in his arms. Chloe was breathless with anticipation of being kissed right then and there, but when the ticket–lady, some old prude wearing a silly fez hat cleared her throat, the couple deposited their money, grabbed their tickets and entered the brightly lit, spinning, colorful fair. It was a little corny as always, but they were two teenagers ready to have fun. Michael absolutely loved Chloe&#039;s outfit. It was sexy, but not sluttish. She was a short, light denim skirt, a fitted tee,…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Andrea had been living with Jake for a couple of years– so naturally; they knew basically everything about each other. Of course, there was one topic that remained painfully secret... for a while. Even though they were very much in love and were sexually active, neither knew of the other&#039;s secret fantasies and fetishes. And since they were afraid of what the other might think about their secrets... It took quite a while for them to come out in the open. It all started on a cool Friday night. Jake had been working overtime all week and Andrea was struggling with her new job. Both had been pretty stressed out lately and decided to jump–start their weekend. They booked a table at an expensive restaurant on Greene…</p>
