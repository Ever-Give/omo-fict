        <p class="card-text">From an early age I discovered that I obtained much sexual pleasure from holding my pee until I was really desperate. I&#039;ve often played little games with myself whilst out and about just seeing how long I can hold out without going to the toilet. Last weekend I woke up needing a wee but decided to hold on. I was planning a shopping trip and the thought of walking around town whilst desperate to wee was already turning me on. I drank plenty of orange juice with my breakfast and could already feel the pressure on my bladder building up. I put on my short denim skirt and a pair of black panties and set off for town.
The town was very busy and there were lots of queues. At one point whilst waiting at the bank I…</p>

        <p class="card-text">This is Donna&#039;s story. I will tell it to you as she related it to us. One day, a few years ago Donna was outside with a few friends in the garden and they were all very giggly. At one point they were challenging each other to do all sort of things. Finally they challenged one of the girls to wet herself, which she did to her friends&#039; shock and laughter. They all laughed so hard that they almost ended up with wet pants.
A few days later she was in a store with one of those friends and she had to pee. Donna suggested to her that she could always pee her pants, just like the last time. Her friend suddenly got real nervous and giggly and asked Donna if she really meant that. Donna pressed the girl to just go in…</p>

You anxious boys (and girls too, I hope) that can&#039;t abide a touch of foreshadowing and background to illuminate and color this magical thing that makes us all interested in reading this stuff – you can click this narrative down, and get right to the description of my act.

        <p class="card-text">So, I left you with my last experience with Casey. We had finally got a couple of things out in the open. She knew how turned on I was at the sight of her desperation. I knew how much she wanted to see me in a similar situation. 
A week or so after my experience with her she was hanging out at my apartment when somehow the topic came up. Casey expressed the interest of getting me into a situation where she could get me desperate to go. She said the ultimate goal was to see me soak myself. I was a bit turned on by the idea. I have previously written about a situation I had with a good friend of mine, Brooke, last Christmas when we had both wet ourselves. That turned into a pretty orgasmic situation. So I knew…</p>

        <p class="card-text">When I was a student I spent some time on an exchange scheme in Germany and part of this time was spent in Berlin. One day our group was taken on a coach tour of East Berlin. We set off at 8.00, right after breakfast in the hostel canteen. I was pleased to find that I was sitting next to Daniella, a pleasantly rounded Dutch girl who I had noticed before. She filled her skin–tight jeans to perfection, and the outline of her low–cut 1&quot; knickers was clearly visible. Her T–shirt showed she was not wearing a bra. We chatted away freely as we passed through the checkpoint and into the Eastern Zone. We started talking in German, as we were supposed to, but Daniella soon asked me to use English as she was much more…</p>

My sophomore year at college, the Dorm system I lived in consisted of three buildings that needed a new maintenance man as the last one had graduated. The dorms and the college in general tried to give as many jobs as they could to the students to give them extra money. Of course if there were any major construction or re–construction going on, the physical plant personnel would come fix the problem. But for basic closet door repair, painting and the like, I was able to handle. In return I got my room and board for free as a member of staff, which was…</p>

Episode 3 – &#039;Till Wet do us Part
Laurie&#039;s jeep stopped with screaming tires at her sorority dorm. The door on the passenger side swung open immediately, and Kitty jumped out; her jeans were thoroughly soaked, she had already peed in her pants on two separate occasions but her bladder still wasn&#039;t empty – and her need remained. She took a few steps towards the dorm, but then looked back to see what was keeping the others. Laurie was helping Cathy, who was still crying and sobbing –as she had been all through the drive over here–, out of the car. She was trembling, clothed in nothing but a soiled T–shirt and her soaking wet panties. &quot;Will you hurry up!&quot; Kitty screamed, &quot;I still…</p>

Episode 2 – Return of the Living Wet
Each time there was a party on campus, one of the sorority members had the duty to stay in the dorm to ensure security and to open the door for fellow members who came home. This night, the victim was Cathy, not exactly one of the more popular girls although she was quite attractive, but her general attitude and interest in sports (she was on the hockey team) made the other girls have doubts about her sexual preferences. Cathy woke up in the middle of the night. She was certain she had heard something: a loud sound, like someone banging on the plumbing. None of the other girls had come home yet, and although she always had a butch exterior…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Then unbelieving, turning into sad. Finally plain mad. The cheek of it all. Staying out all night, coming home in the morning with what was feeble excuses, before owning up to having spent the night at some tart&#039;s place. Not his words, that. He had slowly gotten to the point, which was that he intended to stay with this slut, and would she please pack her things and be gone, like, tomorrow?A year and a half of living together, and then, poof. All right. A year and a half of staying at his place, bringing mostly clothes and glass animals. He had resented the animals, but until now he had loved her clothes, especially the short and tight ones. Apparently what fit in the clothes could be exchanged at times. Fuck…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Getting into the car, Ian suggested that they call for some lunch and a drink at his club. Jill was a little concerned about going in with no panties on, a predicament arising from their exploits in the car park. She felt her skirt was damp at the back, but Ian reassured her that it did not show. Going in to the club, which was very elegant, they checked in, and then proceeded to their respective toilets to freshen up. In the luxurious ladies&#039; toilet Jill wiped her tummy and legs with a damp flannel, before applying perfume between her thighs, wishing she had retrieved some clean panties from her case. Then she repaired her make up and tidied up her hair. With one final look in the large mirror she felt…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Since the beginning of high school, they always met each other at the bus stop, near their houses. Every morning Jenni would show up in her school uniform; a plaid skirt or blue slacks, a white polo shirt or a white button down shirt, and or course the white socks. She usually wore the plaid skirt to show off her long legs. Both Stacy and Jenni had blonde hair, and brown eyes, and a golden tan.As usual, Stacy got to the bus stop before Jenni arrived, so she started to study for a test. About ten minutes had gone by and Stacy was beginning to worry that Jenni wasn&#039;t going to school today. But a minute before the bus got there, Stacy saw Jenni running towards the bus stop. She felt relieved but Jenni was not…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Kate shifted her weight, balancing evenly on both feet, and moved her legs about 18 inches apart. It was going to happen any second now, so she tensed her muscles and really started to concentrate. The tension was slowly killing her, she could feel her muscles starting to quiver and she knew that once it was all over she could finally take a deep breathe and relax. It was coming, and there was nothing she could do to stop it.
She saw movement, her brain tracked it, and she flung herself to the right, stretching her leg as far as it would go. The hockey ball struck the outside of her pad, clipping a metal buckle, and deflected past the outside of the goalpost. &quot;Save&quot;, she thought, as the umpire blew the…</p>
