        <p class="card-text">This is the first story I&#039;ve written and it happened to me a couple of days ago. I&#039;m 25 years old, and have been married for three years. My wife Ashley and I started going out when we were 16 and have been together ever since. She&#039;s hot, blond with a killer figure. Ashley is the kind of girl everyone likes, she&#039;s sweet, kind and very sexy, and I&#039;m very protective of her. I have seen her desperate to pee about three times in our relationship, and one of them was at school. She knows that it&#039;s my fantasy to see her like this, but she very never does it, so I was surprised the other day.
I woke up at ten on Saturday and looked at my sexy wife. She is shopping obsessed, and has a dozen things to sleep in, but…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Madison was my best friend in my junior year of high school. We became close almost instantly, and we were almost never apart. We told each other everything, so it was only natural that she told me about how peeing made her come. I told her that I was the exact same way, and within a few months of meeting, we became lovers. We would always go to each other&#039;s houses, or drive somewhere secluded, and act out our most wild fantasies. One day, on the way to a most often deserted field, our most memorable experience occurred. We had started the day by drinking lots of coffee like we always did. Then we got into the car, she was driving, and turned on the radio. Usually, we managed to hold our pee without leaking…</p>

        <p class="card-text">As she watched her mom pull out of the driveway, Becca could hardly contain her excitement. She had waited all morning for this. She had started the day by drinking lots and lots of coffee, telling her mom that she needed to wake herself up to study for her finals. As she sat down at the computer now, she started to look at sites with pictures– pictures of girls wetting their panties, pictures of girls masturbating, and even pictures of girls humping each other. How she longed to do the same. Her clit began to tingle.
Her mom had told her to do the laundry. Now she had a wonderful idea. She made her way into the laundry room, and decided to do a load of jeans. She picked up the first pair, and put them on.…</p>

        <p class="card-text">There was a bit of a delay getting this third part out to you all. I thought I had sent it just a couple days after part two, but I think I suffered a bit of an organizational breakdown. At any rate it never got sent, but here it is now, better late than never. I hope you all are enjoying reading this– it has gotten longer than I thought it would. At first I thought two parts would take care of it, but it is really a lot of fun to write about, so I&#039;m including all the detail I can remember. I&#039;ve decided to put my e–mail address on this one just so I can hear how you all like my story. You can write me using the link at the bottom of this page.

Hi, I&#039;m Renee, a 28–year–old chemist with Everett Pharmaceuticals. I first saw Gabriele at the company ladies&#039; softball game. She was medium tall, like me, mid twenties with short red hair, and she was clearly unsure of herself as she stood there while sides were being chosen. But I noticed something else besides her shyness. Her thighs and biceps looked strong...this woman worked out. No one else seemed to notice though, and she was chosen last by the other team.
She did not play until the last two innings. At bat with one out and a runner on first, she swings well and hits the ball hard. But it is right at our second baseman who catches it and then catches the runner off first..…</p>

No need to bore you with the story of second–hand furniture and the roaming of garage sales, we were soon ready to live happily ever after. Karin was of average height, with brown curls to her breasts, green eyes and a nice girly shape. She preferred jeans and a sweater, but wore the occasional dress to feel womanlier. I&#039;m an ordinary guy. The most out–of–the–ordinary about me she didn&#039;t know about. We had a good sex life when we first started, enjoying each other regularly.

She would lay in bed at night, softly stroking her young pussy, and think about the day that would come, when she could live out her most wild fantasies. Her friend Jane was on her way...
Jane was into peeing too. Both she and Annie were only 18, but they had known each other since they were 5. They went through the everyday accidents of accidentally peeing in their pants when they were little. If one wet her pants, the…</p>

Sam&#039;s parents were going to visit her older sister, who had just had a new baby, so they would be gone as well, which left us either house available for our sleepover. Sam decided that she wanted me to stay with her at her house instead of coming to mine– and for some reason she…</p>

He needed to work in the attic and knew it would be best done early, before the Southern California sun turned the attic into an oven.

        <p class="card-text">I am at work. I am married to the most beautiful woman in the world, and she never leaves my thoughts. As another boring day goes on I compose this story:
Michelle wakes up and stretches her light brown body, then curls up again knowing it is still early, letting her hands rub her round belly and a little further down as well. A little later she rises, naked, and enters the bathroom where she meets herself in the full–length mirror. She likes to be seen. At thirty–five she has a perfect butt– probably as a product of her Caribbean ancestry, and a narrow waist above full hips. Her breasts are quite small, but very pretty; her black hair reaches her nipples when she straightens it. She turns on the taps.

        <p class="card-text">Blair was grocery shopping for the big party she was having the next day. All she could think about as she walked down the aisles was the huge amount of fun she would have with all of her girlfriends. Unfortunately, she had gotten so caught up in everything she was doing at home that she had forgotten to go to the grocery store until the very last minute.
&quot;I hope I can manage to get there before it closes&quot; –she thought to herself.
It was still open, but it was only 20 minutes from closing time. As she hurriedly made her way down the aisles, she was distracted by something going on in the back room. It sounded like an employee was getting fired, or at least yelled at a whole lot. So she hid behind a display…</p>

The card, off white with a pink and blue speckled background with specks of silver glitter attached, simply read &quot;Happy Birthday&quot; with a big blue number &quot;18&quot; embossed in the lower right. Firework–like designs surrounded the big &quot;18&quot; emblem. She opened the card and quickly scanned the message, looking for a check she thought might be in there. &quot;Happy 18th, honey. To a wonderful daughter on her special day! Love, Mom.&quot; Scribbled in black, from Mom&#039;s treasured 1940&#039;s fountain pen her grandmother had passed down to her.

        <p class="card-text">Just to set the scene, I&#039;m a bi girl, into watching. My name is Summer.
A few years ago, I was on a bus traveling across Australia on my gap year. I was sitting right at the back in the window seat and a pretty, blonde girl was sitting on the opposite side. The desert had been rolling by for hours and I hadn&#039;t really taken much notice of her. But then I noticed she was beginning to fidget. She was trying to read a map, jiggling the whole time. After a minute she turned to me, leaned over the empty seats and said. &quot;Excuse me, do you know how much further we&#039;ve got to go?&quot;
I looked at my watch. &quot;About 2 hours.&quot;
She smiled and thanked me and sat back in her seat. But she couldn&#039;t sit still. She stared out of…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Okay, earlier I had peed my panties sitting on the toilet (part 1) and peed my jeans on the bed (part 2). This was the greatest day ever! I was sure I was still drunk after all the rum I drank, but I still had 9 hours before anyone got home. It is not very often I get the house to myself so I decided to use it to the fullest. I drank more rum, but kept it slow. I wanted to stay in the joyous state I was in. I wondered what naughty thing was left to do. Then it came to me; what was more arousing than smoking? I had taken a few puffs before with friends, but had never smoked a whole cigarette before. I imagined peeing, masturbating, and smoking. What more could I want? Mom thought that I didn&#039;t know she sneaked…</p>
