        <p class="card-text">She could make me do anything.
I first saw her at an early–morning swim. We were the first to arrive, before the hall filled up. She was swimming with slow, easy strokes, doing flip–turns and sliding under water, long hair streaming. She was wearing a red, high–cut swimsuit, emphasizing her slender, well–trained body. I went in, doing the best I could, but found her passing me again and again. I had to admire the elegant way she moved in the water.
Suddenly she was gone. I decided it was time to return to the dressing room.
We were still alone. She stood under the shower, back to me, washing her hair. She looked to be in her early forties, but very fit for her age, with slim waist, tight buttocks and just a…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Gina Marstin sat at her computer with her hand between her legs trying to prolong the inevitable... a trip to the bathroom to relieve her torturously full and visibly swollen bladder. It wasn&#039;t that this would provide any help in keeping her silky white nylon panties dry; they had hosted her deliciously wet pussy for quite some time before her desperation (and her fingers) had entered the picture. As she contemplated her trip to the bathroom she thought how she, always so prim and proper, had arrived at this point.
She and her husband were opposites in everything they did. She was an early riser and he liked to sleep in. Since their bedroom time was so different, they discovered early in their 12–year…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Sue Frederick took a shallow breath and tried to maintain her composure. She had not accounted for the extra pressure on her bladder from the huge soft drink her employee had ordered for each of them at lunch. It had fallen in well with her plan so she had said nothing. Now she was beginning to wonder about her timing, to say nothing of her bladder capacity. Reminding herself of her goal, she gave herself a quick caress between her legs, then another because it felt sooo good the first time. Art would not know what hit him!
At 135 pounds on a five foot three inch frame, the dark haired accounting supervisor could have been a bit chubby, but Sue had been blessed with a firm, ample bust topped by richly dark…</p>

I am on an express bus sitting in a rear seat, going out to the suburbs to visit a relative for the weekend. The bus stops at one of the last downtown pickup points and then becomes an express bus with no more stops.
A beautiful, petite, slim, very sexy young woman climbs aboard. Her spectacular green eyes, set in a finely chiseled, sharp but not harshly contoured aquiline face, contrast marvelously with her stunning red hair. She is wearing a not quite see through green blouse that sets off her eyes and hints at a sexy, lacy bra cradling petite but perky eagerly up–thrusting breasts. A tight red miniskirt shows off perfectly sculpted lean legs, tapering nicely into matching…</p>

        <p class="card-text">I&#039;m 26, 5foot 5, 9stone nearly (120 pounds) and my boy friend is twice my age nearly. Both of us like watersports and we play almost every weekend. It was a Saturday in August 2000; we were on Robert&#039;s boat under the shade of an avenue of trees. The afternoon sun shone on a notice board saying &#039;Beware– Army shooting range&#039; so we stayed on board idly watching the ducks. My summer dress is the shortest a tubby girl can wear without looking silly. It&#039;s a pale blue with a belted waist and very full in the skirt covering my faded pink knickers by about three inches if I stand up straight.

Tall and willowy with blonde hair that cascaded down her shoulders and a sweet, very white, sort of baby face and sparkling, crystal blue eyes, Robin was of German–American ancestry.
Shortly after we began our relationship, Robin boldly stated, &quot;My main desire sexually is to do precisely whatever pleases you.&quot; She was kind of a sub, but far from being passive, exhibited an extremely ebullient, outgoing personality. She cajoled me to somewhat reluctantly confess to my watersports affinity; the first time I had done so in my entire life.

It had been after a long night of incredible (and I mean *incredible*) sex with my fianc&#039;. I woke up before he did, sat up in bed, and just watched him sleep. God, he was so gorgeous. Then, I felt the urge to pee. It wasn&#039;t too bad, just one of those morning pees. I was about to get up, but he woke up. We smiled at each other and I cuddled up next to him. He playfully started kissing me, but I was distracted because my urge to pee was getting stronger –– a LOT stronger. As he started to gently kiss down my stomach, I knew I had to go relieve myself. I think he saw my discomfort and figured out that I had to pee.

&quot;My troubles started when we were having a drink in the evening. I got into a stupid argument with Sharon, and we had a drinking contest, seeing who could drink a pint the fastest, and then immediately a rematch changing drinks, so I drank lager and Sharon bitter. (Sharon is a white girl who always seems to rub me up the wrong way. If I had not already been drinking I would have ignored her, like I usually do. It would have been much better if I had.) We had hardly finished that when Sister Loraine was telling us it was time to leave, and I just had to finish my drink before we left, so I had…</p>

        <p class="card-text">My virtual experience of Jill was one of scented rainbows, fluid motion, an animal sensuality that transmitted forcefully even across the airwaves. She called herself Gypsy Goddess, and I her Gypsy King. The effervescent mind of this young Up–Easter would not be confined to the humdrum drudgery of rural central Florida, try as she might.
Nonetheless, I was largely unprepared for the flood of flaming femininity that accosted me, and I say accosted because I was almost immediately swept off–balance, when I first met her face to face.
The experience can only be described as slightly hallucinatory. Her youthful beauty stood much more profoundly in evidence than I had imagined from her conversation and pictures,…</p>

        <p class="card-text">The favorite teen hangout that summer (1957) was a 10–acre pond that had been enhanced with a sandy beach and a platform with an Olympic style diving board. There were rowboats for rent and there was a concession stand. Even though the lake was far away from her home Pat spent many of her spare hours there in the summer of her eighteenth year (1957).
Pat was by now an accomplished musician having mastered the guitar and she carried her guitar everywhere she went. She didn&#039;t swim that much so her main reason for visiting the lake was to be with her friends and entertain them with her guitar playing. She usually didn&#039;t wear a swimsuit to the lake, as she didn&#039;t plan to swim. Trips to the lake for Pat required…</p>

        <p class="card-text">It was in the fall of 1967 when Nancy found herself in the clutches of the State Police. She was demonstrating on the campus of her college when the demonstration turned violent. She wasn&#039;t aware of this fact and she continued to demonstrate just as she had been prepared to do by the leaders of the demonstration. She was still shouting what a great sham the college administration and the government of the United States was when the state police hustled her and several of her friends into a line where she and her friends would appear in front of a pair of officers who would determine whether Nancy and her friends would be detained or not.
Gathered into this queue, Nancy began to feel a bit uncomfortable. She…</p>

Clare&#039;s alarm clock had failed to wake her in time to allow her normal exam routine of taking a shower, grabbing some breakfast, and reading through her revision notes. As a result her Mum had woken her at 8:30, with the exam due to start at 9 a.m. To make matters worse, it usually took twenty minutes on a good day for the car journey to school and students taking exams had been instructed to get to the exam hall 5 minutes before all exams.
&quot;Oh shit!&quot; Clare thought, as she saw her alarm clock had stopped. &quot;What&#039;s the time?&quot;
&quot;8:30. You&#039;d better hurry up – I&#039;m nearly ready to leave!&quot;
