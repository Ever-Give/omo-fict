        <p class="card-text">Debbie was running as fast as she could through the concourse. Well, running was being generous considering how tight her short little skirt was. As the athlete amongst her group of friends it bothered her that she was lagging yards behind them. They all just had to catch this train otherwise they&#039;d be stranded in New York for at least three hours. Plus on top of all that she had to pee like you wouldn&#039;t believe – no, Debbie wasn&#039;t too happy right now. It had all started innocently enough, Debbie and three of her postgrad classmates from Princeton had decided to go into the city that evening and hit the clubs. Debbie, Jennifer, Suzi and Shanique had ridden the train in earlier that evening, had a great dinner…</p>

It had been a really lovely day. We&#039;d been camping for almost a week and Des and I were so close it was perfect! We shared everything, told each other everything – a magical relationship, in fact.
We&#039;d been together for about two years, and once – and only once – I&#039;d told him how I felt about getting desperate to pee. He&#039;d taken it well; excited even – but I&#039;ll tell that story another time!
There had been a couple of times on this camping trip when one or the other of us had been pretty desperate but we&#039;d always managed to reach a bathroom before disaster struck and on this particular night I was hot and ready for something to…</p>

Robin rocketed out of bed just as her alarm clock exploded with sound. Robin swore, checked the time and swore louder. She was late for soccer practice AGAIN and Coach Martin would not be so understanding this time. The game was to start in just 10 minutes and Robin knew that she&#039;d be very late. Tossing on a sports bra, Robin hurried to the bathroom to comb her hair and brush her teeth. She had to pee but figured she could do that in the locker room. Besides, she just didn&#039;t have the time.
Pulling her strawberry–blonde hair back in a quick ponytail, Robin glanced at the clock again. It was 5 minutes to 10, meaning she had just 5 minutes to get to the…</p>

I had started working at a wood–based summer camp as a counselor when I was just 14. I had learned to appreciate nature, both its beauty and it&#039;s slight discomfort. The campgrounds were the typical mid–forested summer day camp; park benches and wooden tables, a shed for tools and a field area for play. High trees offered shade from the golden summer sun and soft soil padded our hiking trails. However, the lack of adequate facilities was tremendous.
Filthy water covered the muddy concrete floors of the bathrooms where rusty stalls refused to shut and foul toilets refused to flush. The ancient sinks bore no water, what can I say, the toilets were…</p>
