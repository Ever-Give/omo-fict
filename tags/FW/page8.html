        <p class="card-text">Ingrid didn&#039;t really remember how it started. Probably some time in early childhood, when she discovered that putting off going to the little girls&#039; room caused a mix between pain and pleasure that made her tingle all over. Like everybody else she peed in the sea when she had to, but eventually she always was careful to avoid the toilet before going to the beach. From just letting go under water, she began releasing her urine as she waded in, feeling the warm wetness in her bathing suit seconds before the water reached her crotch. Lingering in the shower after exercises at school, she let it run down her legs when nobody could see her. Soaking in the tub at home, she spread her legs as the water drained,…</p>

        <p class="card-text">The clock tick–tocked slowly, every eye was watching the minute hand... any second now the bell would ring. Finally, the clock struck 3:00 and all of the students dashed out of the classrooms. After dumping their books in their lockers, Laura, Nicole, Lydia, Elizabeth (Liz), and Melissa met outside. It was a nice Friday afternoon and the girls had planned a &quot;Girls&#039; Night Out&quot; for that night. It was Elizabeth&#039;s turn to play hostess that night, so the gang was headed to her house. As usual, all the girls were giggly chatterboxes, except Lydia. Lydia was a quiet, timid girl, but she was being unusually quiet that afternoon. When questioned by the other girls, her reply was, &quot;Oh, nothing.&quot; So, thinking that she…</p>

        <p class="card-text">You&#039;re my Aunty Julie, and I have had a crush on you for a long time. I can remember watching you as a young teenage girl, when I spied you in the bathroom one day, watching you in your panties and bra in the bathroom. You didn&#039;t see me I think, but I was hiding in the bathroom closet from my younger sister, staring out through the louvers. I saw you looking at yourself in the mirror, admiring your curves that I had liked so much. Watching you admiring yourself turned me on so much!
I also noticed that you had damp panties, like you had recently accidentally wet yourself a little. I didn&#039;t know why, but I found the idea very arousing, and as my breath came is shuddering whispers my hand found its way slowly…</p>

This is a true f/f event 
After we had shopped ourselves out around the boutiques of Bristol, we sat in a coffee shop to talk. I was inquisitive as to whether or not Fiona was really into watersports, or it had just been a way for her now obvious lesbian tendencies to manifest themselves when we had been in the toilet cubicle. She told me that she had been wetting herself for about two and a half years, ever since she had not reached a toilet in time, and she had enjoyed the experience. When I explained to her, that in addition to enjoying the feeling of being wet, that I also liked wearing a nappy and plastic or rubber pants, Fiona was intrigued. She wanted to know when and where I…</p>

        <p class="card-text">My neighbor Darlene has always been one of the best neighbors one could hope for. I had known Darlene for years as a secretary in the Honors Program at the University, and had been quite surprised to discover when she moved in next door to me.
Back then Darlene had been the proud possessor of a body to die for. She had been blessed by nature with perhaps the most beautiful and bountiful breasts I had ever seen on a small (about 5&#039;3&quot;) slender woman. It was always a pleasure to observe her large nipples stand up and salute through whatever blouse she was wearing during our conversations over the low wall separating our houses.
Sadly, this sweet and supportive young woman made many mistakes in her choice of men…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Karen, Mia and I had been friends since going to college at Ohio State University. We had all had a few serious dating relationships since college, but always seemed to get back together when those relationships failed.
This weekend we rented a cabin and a rowboat in the woods near a small lake in West Virginia. The cabin included just the bare necessities, and was pretty isolated from the rest of the campers on the lake.
We started drinking beer about 7:00 pm, and decided to take the rowboat out for a trip around the lake. We took a cooler of beer with us, and headed out to explore the lake. Blond haired, blue–eyed Karen was wearing a white t–shirt, a pair of loose fitting blue and white cotton shorts, and…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Ashley took a deep breath and opened the door to her classroom; she had to be ready to execute her plan. You see, Ashley loved to piss her pants and panties; she loved the feeling of holding a full bladder as long as she could. But one thing she loved even more was the satisfaction of being humiliated and embarrassed while being seen in public. She got horny at the thought.
So Ashley came up with a brilliant plan, she had asked for a study session with Mrs. Ross, a middle aged blonde haired woman, who was quite attractive. Ashley chose her for two reasons– one: the thought of wetting herself in front of her hot biology teacher made her insanely horny, and two: the fact that Mrs. Ross had some strict rules…</p>

In her 18th year, my middle daughter was a real knockout. She was tall and slender and kept after herself. As I look back, I miss all those girly things like shampoo and perfume smells, her music playing and her giggling with her friends when she filled the house with other pretty teens. Sometimes her friends would do the courteous thing and say hello to &quot;the Dad&quot; or give a nod or wink. What these kids choose to wear, or not to wear today makes me crazy and I confess, I get really hot…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Hi. I have been lurking here for quite some time, and love all the stories. Then I thought I should post some of my memories, as I always thought other people were rude if they lurked and didn&#039;t play &quot;show &amp; tell!&quot; So here goes.
I grew up on a secluded New Zealand farm, very steep country, but lovely native forest with sparkling streams and rivers. This story is from my favorite place in the world! It is from early on in my wetting, back when it was more fun than sexual. I hope you like it.
I guess I first got interested in wetting my panties at an early age, too. I remember growing up on our farm, and a lot of the time I would be left to my own for long periods of time. Summer was the best time of the year.…</p>

        <p class="card-text">A few years ago when I was living in London I traveled on the underground regularly (that&#039;s usually called &#039;the Tube&#039; in London, or the Subway or Metro for people outside the UK), and would often see girls who were obviously desperate for a pee.
Because there are no toilets on the Underground trains, and none on most of the stations, on many occasions I was lucky enough to witness girls getting so desperate that it resulted in a &#039;wetting&#039;, or a &#039;public peeing&#039; where the girl would just finally give up and squat down for a pee. However, this is the only &#039;Business Suit&#039; wetting that I can remember.
On this particular day I was traveling during the middle of the day and the trains were not very crowded, so…</p>

They&#039;ll be asleep for the next two hours and he will almost certainly sit beside them watching them breathe. He has proved himself an expert nappy changer, claiming to have practiced on me though we&#039;ve never tried the adult baby route. Some might say we&#039;ve been babyish throughout our time together. Whatever the case it&#039;s all got to come to a halt for now so I&#039;ve decided to set down some of the things about Robert and his ways that might intrigue your readers.
Some parts of our tale had to be excluded because there was no story around them. There was the time Robert was challenged to a…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Loretta and I had just attended a piano concert and we were waiting in the attended parking garage for an attendant to bring my car forward. Neither of us had been able to go to the bathroom for several hours and both of us had imbibed a few beers just before the concert. Now we were standing on the platform waiting for my car while there were many other patrons doing the same. While I was somewhat uncomfortable with the stress on my bladder, I couldn&#039;t help but notice that Loretta was getting desperate for a pee.
She shifted her weight from one foot to the other and occasionally walked around in a small circle. She was wearing an off–white suit with a straight skirt and powder blue blouse. She didn&#039;t mention…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Linda didn&#039;t know why she enjoyed wetting herself. She only knew the secret pleasure of letting go into her panties. The sensual release she felt as the wet patch at her crotch moved up and down the inside of her thighs, spreading a comfortable warmth in her most sensitive areas. For years, she had reveled in the shameful naughtiness of the act, but she did not try to understand it.
Maybe that was all there was to it, she thought to herself as she lay on her bed, idly fondling the crotch of her jeans. Linda looked at her watch and frowned. Her girlfriends were supposed to call her when they were ready to meet. If they didn&#039;t come soon, they were going to miss the movie.
No matter, she decided. She had…</p>
