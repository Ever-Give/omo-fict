Jenny could still hear Jerry banging around in the toilet behind the hut as she finished chapter 2 of her book. It was approaching 11 am and the sun was now high in the sky. With nary a cloud in sight, Jenny had taken the opportunity to move her stool outside in front of the hut to catch some of the rays. Little beads of perspiration formed on her flat, bronze tummy as she took in the heat and she wondered if her mother had taken the day off work since it was so beautiful outside. Jenny&#039;s mother, Sandie was also a looker. Only 37, she had Jenny when she was 18. Sandie never got the chance to go to college and raised Jenny…</p>

        <p class="card-text">&#039;How did it go so wrong,&#039; Gabri–Ann asked herself as she sat in her jail cell on this miserable, half–frozen planet. Since her empathic abilities had developed she sensed she was destined to meet her soul mate, the women she would join with for life, but it never happened. Then she started working for the Paltathion Ministry of Education, only to be arrested for murder. And then she had believed she could postpone her execution indefinitely by giving herself to Cota, but now even that had failed.
Gabri–Ann sensed the jailers were coming with a new prisoner, and she combed her short blond hair and straightened her robe before they entered. The new prisoner was wearing an officer&#039;s uniform of the Imperial…</p>

Cathy and I were together for over three years. She was attractive, warm, kind, intelligent and witty. Everything a man could want, it might seem. Unfortunately not, if a man had tastes like mine. As far as my preferred fantasies were concerned, she was a sad disappointment. She wasn&#039;t shy or inhibited in any way; she would announce, &quot;I&#039;m going to the toilet&quot; in a quite matter–of–fact tone. But that was all. Never did she admit to being &quot;desperate&quot; or &quot;bursting,&quot; or to any kind of urgency. Sometimes when we came home she would head to the bathroom without delay, but never did she offer the slightest comment – &quot;I…</p>

Lisa looked up at Christy confused and Christy smirked at her, saying, &quot;If you&#039;re going to be wetting your pants like a baby, then we need to treat you like one! I want you to go to the store and buy some diapers and a pacifier. Also buy a pair of handcuffs.&quot;
Lisa threw her arms in the air and looked down at her soaking wet jeans. Christy smiled and said, &quot;You&#039;re going just like you are now.&quot; She looked up at the clock. &quot;Hurry, baby, I&#039;m timing you.&quot; Christy lay on the couch and turned on the television.

The problem, though, is that from time to time a girl floats into the life that thinks the city stinks and the country is where it&#039;s at. Whereas, of course, as far as I&#039;m concerned it&#039;s the country that stinks (literally, in many cases: I mean, have you ever actually smelled a pig farm or a stable yard?) and the city is where it&#039;s really at.

        <p class="card-text">A while ago – actually quite a while – I met a girl on the Internet. Casually, we exchanged some thoughts and experiences concerning watersports. After a while, we were already deeply into the subject and had dropped in passing some information about the people we had met on our way. In one of my mails I had answered her question whether I knew people in Europe who were into watersports, too, in writing her that I had made very few such acquaintances. Actually, all I remembered was a summer I had passed in France working on a farm, a while ago. It was a small hamlet with just a farm, two houses and a small chapel in a picturesque landscape of small mountains and green valleys. Nice place to be on holidays,…</p>

We had come here directly from work, so that we were both still wearing our business clothes, i.e. blouses, skirts and pantyhose. Carlene had taken off her pumps directly after leaving the office so that two tiny runs had developed up her calves, embellishing her seemingly brand new nylons.
Carlene leaned back in her chair, looking totally relaxed and happy, and closed her eyes. I had seen that behavior a couple of times before, and I was pretty sure about what she would do right now. And yes, she just emptied her bladder – as…</p>

It was a little after noon and Nikki was relaxing on the couch reading a book. As was her habit, she had already had quite a lot of liquid to drink– orange juice with breakfast, a large tea, and several glasses of water.

She looked great in tight Levi&#039;s and anything that revealed her cleavage. Pity the sad bastard of a husband didn&#039;t appreciate her shapes.

Mary was intent on holding her bursting bladder much longer...she is usually so strong that way. She does it for me because it&#039;s the ultimate turn on for me. However, the ice pack on her pelvis broke her will in less that one minute.
So, I got to thinking about other ways to chill her. I wish we had a walk–in freezer, but we don&#039;t. I imagined using the freezer at the local pizza joint, but I knew the owner wouldn&#039;t appreciate the mess.
I thought about waiting until the cold weather returns, but that&#039;s months away.
All of a sudden, I knew the solution. We have a 2–quart enema bag hanging in the closet. We use it…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Do you believe in psychic powers? You know – mind reading, and stuff like that? I never used to: but that was before I met Rosie. And believe you me, Rosie could read a man&#039;s mind, no doubt about it. Actually, let me amend that statement. Not could, but would. Did. Whether she wished to or not. To her, reading my thoughts – or any other man&#039;s thoughts, for that matter – was as involuntary a process as smelling their scent or hearing their speech. Which was scary– very scary. And because she was so very scary, she was also very lonely. Most psychics are, it seems. So if you should ever meet one, try not to let their powers scare you off. Try instead to be attentive, loving, and true. You see, they make very…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Frank Jarmon is looking forward to the weekend with more than his usual enthusiasm. The 54–year–old environmental technician normally has his time fully occupied with his two grown kids, his 14 year old, 2 grandkids and 2 more on the way. Put that together with the demands of friends and relatives and free time became a bit rare. His plans for this weekend include none of them, only himself and lots of liquids. He has gotten a head start on the planned activities by not visiting the restroom since lunch. This fact is being reviewed with caution now. It&#039;s still an hour before he gets off and his bladder is requesting relief; more than a little insistently. Frank calculates his need and wonders; his bladder is…</p>

        <p class="card-text">The sun shone through the window on the beautiful June morning, the slivers of sunlight beamed through the curtains into the bedroom. A ray of light hits a sleeping girl&#039;s face and she tosses and turns as she slides into consciousness. Today was Shannon&#039;s 18th birthday and she couldn&#039;t have asked for a more beautiful day to celebrate it on. There wasn&#039;t a cloud in the sky and it was a perfect 30 degrees outside. Her friends had decided that they were going to take Shannon to dinner for her birthday and then throw her a party at her friend Sarah&#039;s house. Shannon knew that she probably would get some really cool stuff for her birthday because she hounded her friends and family for weeks telling them what she…</p>

He had run his small jewelry store by himself since he opened a year ago, but business had picked up and he decided to get someone part time to help out. He thought Jenny was so cute but too young. She had a pretty smile and long blonde hair and a tiny sexy body. And she was wearing a cheerleader uniform.
&quot;Hello Mr. Thompson, I am Jenny. Amanda told me you needed somebody part time.&quot;
&quot;My daughter, Amanda?&quot;
&quot;Yes Sir, we are in the same class at school.&quot;
&quot;Well if you are in her class then I am sorry but you are too young to work here.&quot;

I take the dress off the hanger and brush my hand across the smooth, shimmering ruby–red fabric. The anticipation already sends little sparks of pleasure through my mind and body. I feel the tips of my nipples harden slightly and a warm sensation passes over my breasts and between my thighs. Stepping into the dress and slowly pulling it up and over my legs, watching in the mirror as it climbs over my thighs and hips. The sheer light tan tights and white satin high–leg briefs I&#039;ve chosen are slowly covered by the sheer red body of my outfit and I finish running the dress over my bare chest, already cupping and gathering my breasts…</p>
