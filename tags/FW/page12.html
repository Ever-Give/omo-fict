        <p class="card-text">Hi all,
It all started with me reading a lot of erotic stories about hypnosis on http://www.literotica.com.
I was intrigued by the idea of it, and turned on as well. I knew that it did not work like that, no–one does anything he or she normally would not do under hypnosis, but I decided to try to learn hypnosis never the less. I went to the library of a university and lent some of the books. I read trough them and learned nothing new. No luck there, so I wanted to get a few more. This time I did not go the general university library, but to the one of the physiology department. I looked around and found a very old book about hypnosis. It was so old, and written in such old language that no one hat lent it…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Susy and Carly had left the nightclub and were taking a short cut home through the new Retail Park. Blonde haired Susy hadn&#039;t been too keen to go this way. She considered it kind of creepy, deserted, and as it was midnight, she also thought it might be a pretty good place to get mugged, beaten up, or worse.
Red haired Carly, older (though not necessarily wiser) by five years, pooh–poohed the younger girl&#039;s fears, pointing out that the area was well lit; in fact probably better lit than the route they&#039;d have had to take through town.
So they ended up walking past the various collections of shops and stores. Carly was stopping at virtually every shop to look in the windows at what was on sale. Susy though, was…</p>

        <p class="card-text">While out to a little piano bar the other night, I ran into the ex–wife of a former neighbor. I used to go over and play cards or just hang out at their place.
When she noticed me, she came over and gave me a big hug, and we started talking about old times. I hadn&#039;t seen her in about 15 years; she is now a very striking lady of 45.
Way back when, she used to catch me looking at her gorgeous body, and I caught her once or twice looking at the front of my jeans, and she got a rise out of me at least once. But it never went beyond looking. After talking for about an hour, she left no doubt in my mind she wanted to have sex. She told me how many times she had fantasized that it was I instead of her husband she…</p>

        <p class="card-text">This story is based on real facts. (Everything related in it its true and happened some time ago).
On a fine sunny Friday of late May, my ex girlfriend and I decided to go on a trip to the mountains, just the two of us. (It was actually planned to make things work better between us.)
So on that Friday afternoon we went to the station and we took the train to Brasov situated 140 Kilometers from our city. From there we took a bus to the resort where we were going.
We arrived at about 6:00 pm, and we took out a room in a villa. Things were going really well. After settling down we went down to a club to spend our first evening. (This was at about 8:30 pm)
My girlfriend, Maria, was dressed in a nice pair of…</p>

        <p class="card-text">On their second date Bruce and Nancy were ensconced in a neighborhood tavern where they were drinking beer and scarfing up on all the goodies that were served at the bar. They had gobbled up six or seven beers by early afternoon and a couple of bowls of chips and popcorn. After the first six beers they had both relieved themselves and were quite aware of further requirements for relieving themselves. 
Before the next requirement came to their attention, Bruce suggested that they retire to his garden apartment to grill some steaks on the balcony. Nancy thought it was a great idea and stood up to prepare to leave. Both Bruce and Nancy had a slightly full bladder but both thought that they were in control. As…</p>

However, such incidents have necessarily had to be incidents of pure accident in order to arouse me. I have never thought I would be aroused by purposeful wetting accidents on the part of females. But then, I never considered it possible that a female would wet herself on purpose.
Male wettings whether accidental or not has never entered my mind as a means of sexual arousal, only as a matter of curiosity.

        <p class="card-text">Maggie checked her watch. Just past 5:30 and just outside her comfort zone. Six months into her job and life in New York, and she had the timing down perfectly. Two liters of water and no restroom breaks after 4:00, and let the rumbling on the subway do the rest. 
It was late October, and that morning had been pleasantly chilly on the walk from her apartment to the station and then to her office at the end of the line. The overcast sky and the ever so slight nip in the breeze had gotten her thinking; maybe this was one of her special days. When lunchtime had finally rolled around, she&#039;d known for sure. Friday night, a place of her own downtown, all that time to herself and the melancholy from the last breakup…</p>

        <p class="card-text">It was a garden party, something to do with film; one of those mill–around–and–be–seen–things where you talk to people you don&#039;t know about nothing at all while you wait for somebody important to drift by. I&#039;m something like the second unit&#039;s third cameraman&#039;s focus puller&#039;s assistant, which makes me the one you don&#039;t know. I got tired of hearing about nothing at all, so I drifted around the corner in search of the third unit&#039;s fourth sound recorder&#039;s microphone cleaner or so, hoping she was female and unattached. The woman stepped out from behind the hedge, shoes in one hand, and tall glass in the other. Unsteadiness more from the contents of the glass, or the ones before that, than from walking barefoot – it…</p>

        <p class="card-text">A few friends of mine came to me one day. They were having an argument about who was the most daring of them all and they wanted me to decide who it was. I thought that if I played my cards right I could be in for some fun. I&#039;m a guy, by the way.
I told them that I was prepared to be a sort of referee; however there were to be some ground rules. I wanted to be a witness to all challenges, or else I couldn&#039;t be fair. Secondly I wanted to stay friends with all of them so I said that I was going to be fair, and that they shouldn&#039;t get mad at me for making judgments. Thirdly– I wanted someone to be the most daring in at least 3 things, so it wouldn&#039;t be chance. Fourth– I knew two of them had a phobia and I didn&#039;t…</p>

        <p class="card-text">I found this story on one of my first &#039;net surfing&#039; sessions, in 1996, but the version I downloaded was incomplete, possibly due to my inexperience on the net, ending with the girls still on the train. I have &#039;tidied&#039; the start and written an ending I consider most probable, and would have liked to have witnessed, and offer the completed story for others to enjoy. If the original author reads it, or anyone has the complete original version, I would like to have a copy, to see what really happened. The events remind me of the times when I used to drink in the West End of London at weekends, and it was possible to see at least one good desperation scene, though not up to this standard, almost every week.
