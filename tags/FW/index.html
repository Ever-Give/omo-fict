        <p class="card-text">This story contains Female Desperation, Humiliation, Female Wetting, Female Peeing, and Golden Showers. When I got home, no one was around, so I quietly went to my room, changed clothes and went straight to bed. There was so much to dream about: wet panties, soaked pussies, and overwhelming ladies! Two weeks passed and nothing had happened. The weather was rather rainy and I had chosen to ride my bike or hitch a ride whenever some neighbor&#039;s kid had the same hours as I did. But summer came back and so did my desire to pick up my clothes. Doubtless, Mom would ask for them now that the weather allowed wearing them again. And maybe there was something else that attracted me to that house with a birch tree in…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Nissa shivered with excitement as she hung up the phone. She had just received a call from Lindsey Hoover. LINDSEY HOOVER!!! The guitarist and lead singer of the band she had worshipped practically all her life! In her wildest dreams of becoming a rock star, she had never anticipated THIS. A 5&#039;1&quot;–110 pound, black–haired eighteen year old who had just graduated high school last week was going on tour with her favourite band, TrashFlinger! She HAD to be dreaming. Nissa pinched herself to make sure she was awake before dialling up her band mates to reveal the news. Since Grade 8, Nissa and her best friends had been fans of TrashFlinger, a local punk rock band that had been kicking around for almost ten years now.…</p>

It was by no means the tallest tower in New York City, but definitely one of the city&#039;s finest. It had been constructed over the past two years, 1988 and 1989.The rumour on the street whispered that it had cost Stephen Burns Jr. over twenty million dollars.Glancing at the directory sign, Karen confirmed that she was going to the top floor and hit the elevator button. She took a sip of her large coffee as the elevator arrived. It had been a restless night, with a big day looming. She had finally fallen asleep around 3 am, only to be awakened by her alarm four hours…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Heather hesitantly stepped out of her car and walked towards the gym entrance. She felt nervous and excited at the same time. She was finally addressing her weight concerns with this three–month program. A 5&quot;9 natural blonde with a busty build, she had been the talk of her high school in her younger years. Now 28 years old and a manager at the local Walmart, she had seen her weight skyrocket nearly twenty pounds in past eighteen months, following a bitter break–up with a boyfriend of three years. Despite the weight gain, she still got plenty of lustful stares from men when she walked around the store.Heather showed her ID to the brunette at the front desk and was directed to Training Room B, down the hall on…</p>

After weeks of training and renovations to the bar, it was finally Grand Opening Day. Though it was Misty&#039;s bar, Kiran and Jamie felt as much a part of the project as she did. In fact, they had let Misty know that they were willing to work on tips alone if things didn&#039;t work out as well as planned at the start. However, Misty was hearing none of it– she was convinced the bar was going to be a great success.Misty had named it the &#039;Wild West Games Bar&#039;, which fit well with the old building located in the outskirts of town.

Note: This story contains Female Desperation &amp; Wetting, and Masturbation. I first discovered the pleasurable aspects of wetting my knickers while at university. It all began when I became friendly with a group of girls in the folk music club and began to frequent the various pubs in the area. For some reason cider was our preferred drink, being cheap and strong – despite its well known diuretic properties.When I first joined the group I was amused by the frequent references to ending up with &quot;cider legs&quot; if one of us drank too much. I assumed this to mean drunk, but was to find out otherwise, though our frequent visits to the ladies loo and the fact that I knew that…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Two weeks had passed since the eventful sleepover at Jamie&#039;s house. Both girls had grown to need the others touch. This had led to some incredibly risky lovemaking outside their homes– at the movies, in the quiet corners of the public library, even the bathroom stalls at school. The risk of getting discovered turned them on immensely and they had barely escaped some close calls. Jamie received a phone call from Misty the day after the wetting incident at the bar. Being the experimental type and a closet wetter for many years, Misty was dying for more fun with Jamie and Kiran. However, getting to Mistys apartment during her free hours was a difficult task for the two schoolgirls living under the close…</p>

Note: This story contains Female Desperation &amp; Wetting, Bed Wetting, and &amp; Masturbation. Work has been hell recently. I have really been under pressure to complete a major project to get some complex documentation complete and the whole thing has been dogged by problems. As a result I have had sleepless nights and have felt really stressed out, the eventual result of which proved rather embarassing. At the end of a particularly bad week my friends persuaded me to go out for a drink on Friday night. I arrived home more relaxed and rather drunk, though not excessively so, took a quick shower and tumbled into bed. Around 6.30, half asleep and confused, I realized something was…</p>

She could feel the wet warmness on her arms and took care not to let the bundle dampen her t–shirt.

        <p class="card-text">The Seattle city center traffic was so bad that it was often joked that it caused people to become junkies and then kill themselves. It made sense as the city was famously known for being the center of the early 90’s grunge scene, a short–lived but significant era in rock music, with bands such as Nirvana, Alice in Chains, Pearl Jam, and Soundgarden. Two of the more influential grunge bands, Nirvana and Alice in Chains abruptly ended following the suicides of their lead singers in the mid 90’s.
Mandy, currently stuck in the same afternoon Seattle traffic, sighed deeply as her frustration mounted behind the wheel of her 2004 Volkswagen Golf. She was on her way home from work, a commute that was no more than 20…</p>

Alan lived opposite a park with a clear view of the bus stop that was outside the entrance. He often used to sit and watch people coming and going through the park, and people waiting for the bus. 
Late one evening he was looking out of his window and he saw a couple of young ladies coming out of the park. They looked to be in their late teens or early twenties, and Alan thought they looked quite attractive. One was brown skinned with black hair, and the other was white skinned with ginger hair. Both were…</p>

Natalie had long dark auburn hair and was a slightly plump but pretty girl in her late teens who had a crush on me, despite the fact that I am about 20 years or so her senior. I often visited her parents at their home and Natalie would almost always sit next to me on the sofa. On a couple of occasions she had shown me something of her body, and strangely her parents hadn&#039;t objected. The first occasion was when her mum came in with some new clothes for her. She immediately took them out of the bags and held up a blouse and a bra. Without further ado she stood up, facing me, and removed her top and bra, her ample 38DD breasts bouncing…</p>

Val was fashion modelling, and now helps run an agency. When she first came over here from Italy, she worked in an antiques shop in between assignments. I met her there when I was a student and we got on pretty well. As she was new in England I helped her out with quite a few things. After six months she even had to move in with me, as she had got herself involved with a really dodgy landlord and didn&#039;t feel safe.
We were just friends at this stage, but any bloke would have wanted more, and I was happy to work my way slowly into her affections. Then as luck would have it, two bombshells landed in quick succession.…</p>

Michelle: &quot;Wait a minute girls, I have to pee, can&#039;t hold it anymore.&quot;
Elizabeth guesses that her sister is going to go behind the bushes, or even pull down her jeans and panties to squat right there, but gets surprised seeing Michelle just standing still and closing her eyes. From where she stands she can&#039;t see anything unusual, but now she&#039;s looking at her from behind and sees two lines of wetness starting to form down her sister&#039;s legs as a wet stain grows in her ass.

        <p class="card-text">I had just broken up with my boyfriend and was a little depressed. To be honest, he had broken up with me. No big deal, he was hot, but that was all. Sex was great but we had no real connection. My girlfriend Courtney took it much harder than I did. She called me about a dozen times a day to make sure I was all right. I was!
About a week after the break–up she called and insisted that we have &quot;girl&#039;s night.&quot; I did not need one, but it seemed fun anyway.
She took me to the liquor store and insisted that we buy the best. She had more money than I so I let her pick the drinks. She worked for a law firm. Although she was only a secretary she seemed to run the place. Anyway, money was no problem for her.…</p>
