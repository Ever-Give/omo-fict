        <p class="card-text">Michelle is feeling that familiar sensation in her bladder, telling her that she had been holding too long and it&#039;s time to go to the toilet. It&#039;s past noon and she hasn&#039;t moved from her desk since she arrived that morning. And worse, all the coffee she drunk all morning has since descended to her bladder.
In another situation she wouldn&#039;t have gave it a second thought and would have walked the thirty steps that separated her office from the toilets (two of them, shared with the rest of the offices on the floor), but that time she couldn&#039;t do it because her sister (the only one that worked with her in the family business) had gone out to do some errands. To being able to go to the toilet, she would&#039;ve had to…</p>

        <p class="card-text">It was a cool autumn day when 25 year old Melissa stood on her friend&#039;s doorstep, her long black hair blowing across her sexy eyes in the brisk breeze. Mel is the type of girl that has &quot;the eyes.&quot; &quot;The eyes&quot; are the type of eyes that can give a super sexy look and get anyone to do anything. She fidgeted with her panties for a moment as they were riding into her crotch cause she liked to wear tight satin panties. These ones were blue with flower prints on them under her baby pink mini skirt. She made sure her tits looked nice and perky in her matching pink halter–top and knocked on the door. After she knocked on the door she realized pulling her panties out of her pussy made her horny and she shifted her legs.…</p>

        <p class="card-text">&#039;How did it go so wrong,&#039; Gabri–Ann asked herself as she sat in her jail cell on this miserable, half–frozen planet. Since her empathic abilities had developed she sensed she was destined to meet her soul mate, the women she would join with for life, but it never happened. Then she started working for the Paltathion Ministry of Education, only to be arrested for murder. And then she had believed she could postpone her execution indefinitely by giving herself to Cota, but now even that had failed.
Gabri–Ann sensed the jailers were coming with a new prisoner, and she combed her short blond hair and straightened her robe before they entered. The new prisoner was wearing an officer&#039;s uniform of the Imperial…</p>

&quot;Yeah it is,&quot; her friend Mandy replied. Summer&#039;s brain stopped for a second before she realized that she was thinking out loud.
&quot;So what are we going to do?&quot; Summer asked, her long blonde hair falling almost seductively over her face, sweat dripping from her shoulders down under her tank top, making her 36 Cs glisten under the hot sun. The only thing on her that wasn&#039;t sweaty was her toned, tan legs, which looked especially sexy in her short pink &amp; white striped satin basketball shorts. For being 25 she definitely looked like she could still be in high school and yet would get any guy&#039;s testosterone…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Last week I started a waitress job at this club. The first day, my shift started at 8, and they told me to get there by 7:30 because I&#039;d need to change and fill out a bit of paperwork.
The outfit they gave me was actually quite sexy. Tight t–shirt and a very short miniskirt that only covered half my butt and just barely covered my pussy. They offered me a couple of drinks to loosen my up (on the house of course), which I gladly accepted.
Since it was a night shift there was no lunch break, but I would get 2 paid 15 minute breaks during my shift, which was to end at 5 AM. Things started getting really busy around 10. Around that time I also remember I started to feel a pretty strong urge to pee. It was so…</p>

I&#039;m not gonna make it if this queue keeps stalling like this.&quot;
I nodded. The queue to the loos was truly impressive; people in various stages of discomfort were watching their places like hawks to ensure a few minutes of privacy in the smelly bluish interior of a porta–potty.

I have been living in Portland, Oregon for some time now and I like to go out and have a drink at a bar called Thatcher&#039;s. I have never known where the restroom is and as I particularly don&#039;t like to use the toilet anyway I have never asked.
Well one day I left home and caught a bus. I stood out at that bus stop for what seemed forever when I began to realize I needed to go pee. I was meeting someone at Thatcher&#039;s and didn&#039;t want to be late so I decided to wait until I got to the bar and hopefully would find a quiet corner to pee in. As the bus came down the hill I was dancing back and forth trying…</p>

One day, 19–year–old Allie was sitting home alone in the summer time, just hanging out in her short denim skirt and pink camisole (and if you were looking up her skirt you would see her dark blue cotton bikini panties.) She sat there on the couch bored, watching TV and sipping at her Coke. She was quite a naughty and promiscuous girl, and got anyone she wanted when she wanted them...it wasn&#039;t too hard for her; all she had to do was throw her long, brunette hair over her shoulder and smile her shiny lips at somebody, show off her perfect white teeth with the glitter in her brown eyes and she had them.

As I looked at them I noticed one, a dark haired lady in her twenties jogging up and down. Suddenly her hand went between her legs and she bent forwards at the waist, bending her knees.

        <p class="card-text">A few months ago my friend Melinda had given me a cigarette lighter. When she gave it to me I didn&#039;t smoke, so I thought it was a little weird. I guess because it led me to my first cigarette, I was not complaining– just curious. Why would she give such an odd gift?
I got the answer today.
Yesterday, Melinda and I were at the picnic table at school. We were just talking and gossiping as usual. As she did everyday, she opened the secret pocket in her book bag and pulled out a cigarette. She walked down to the &quot;smokers ditch&quot; and puffed away. As always, I followed her. As usual I seemed out of place in the smokers ditch. All of the others were Punks and Heads, the few that were lucky to have somehow gotten…</p>

        <p class="card-text">It was a sunny but not too hot day in autumn. Carlene and I had agreed to meet after work to do a bit shopping and to enjoy the sun in a street cafe. It was already fairly cold in the morning, so that I had decided for an ankle length skirt and slightly thicker pantyhose. Carlene was wearing black leather pants that I had never seen on her before. They were skin–tight, reaching down to her lower legs, with zippers on the outside. Under those pants she was wearing black pantyhose and dark red ballerinas. Typically for her, her hose had runs at both heels one of which reached up to her pants. Although the ballerinas hid her toes, a huge run on her right forefoot allowed for the assumption that not too many of…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Let&#039;s see where were we? Katia and I had just soaked ourselves outside and had gotten back on the trolley. We had peed so much our sneakers were starting to squish from the pee dripping off of our jeans down into them. This was the dead of winter remember so there was no way we were getting dry, and the warmth of our pee was fading fast.
&quot;We&#039;re gonna be freezing in no time,&quot; I said quietly to Katia.
&quot;We could just keep peeing to keep warm,&quot; she said jokingly. Then almost at the same time we realized that it might not be such a crazy idea. There was no heater on the tram and people were starting to open windows and yell out them so there we were going to be freezing in no time just like Andrea. She had…</p>

        <p class="card-text">We were looking forward to this year&#039;s Rock Festival, with a lot of new groups being expected, and a lot of old friends to be met.
We, that is, three girlfriends and me, were planning to stay for all three days, with the nights to be spent in our four tiny one–person tents. We had learned from last year&#039;s festival that we should not bring with us too many spare clothes, as there would be no time nor space to change. At least we had decided to dress a bit more attractively, after our woollen–socks–and–sandals outfit had made us kind of outsiders last year.
This year, I decided to wear a plain black skirt, a bit less than knee–long and not too tight, together with black tights and ankle–strap sandals without…</p>

&quot;Why not?&quot; she replied. &quot;It&#039;s practical, isn&#039;t it?&quot;
&quot;Practical?&quot; Andy snorted. &quot;It&#039;s so short you&#039;ll flash your knickers to the whole plane every time you sit down, and you&#039;ll freeze when we arrive back at Luton. It&#039;s about five degrees in England at the moment, you know. Now, just run this past me again will you: where&#039;s the practicality in that?&quot;
&quot;It&#039;s short enough that nobody will notice if I pull it out from under my bum when I sit down. That&#039;s what&#039;s practical about it.&quot;
