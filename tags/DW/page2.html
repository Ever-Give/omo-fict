        <p class="card-text">You may have read a couple of our experiences already. Basically I have always had a thing about girls wetting themselves. I cross dress myself and when young, would often pretend to have accidents when dressed as a girl. I became my own ideal woman. All this was hidden well out of everyday sight as I grew up.
Eventually I met one or two girls who I was able to be more open with and began to have fun both sharing their clothes and with pee games. As I was not outwardly very masculine, girls used to assume I was gay and would confide all sorts of things to me. Strangely this gave me a great advantage and I certainly exploited these situations.
I met Val when I was a student. She is stunningly attractive and…</p>

This is another real life experience from me, about what I did right after my previous story, &quot;The camouflaged wetting&quot; =)
I had tortured my bladder two times today already, and I didn&#039;t know how much more it could handle. After stepping out of the shower where I cleaned up after trying my camouflage kit out, I needed to pee really often, like every 30–40 minutes, even though it wasn&#039;t much. My bladder was very weak, but I still had the evening and night for further experiments. Now that I had found this new interest, I couldn&#039;t let any opportunity go to waste. I was hoping that if I didn&#039;t torture my bladder at…</p>

Ellen tried to remove her work shoes while she talked on the office phone, meanwhile ignoring her cell phone. It blared her alma mater&#039;s fight song and made her realize how annoying her ring tone could be. She knew the cell phone call was Stephen and that he was mad at her. She continued to ignore it and it finally stopped ringing, and then beeped that there was voice mail.
&quot;No use looking at that,&quot; she said to herself. She walked over to the window and looked down. Ten stories below she could see Stephen&#039;s red Mercedes idling at the curb in front of the building. She knew he was inside the car, fuming at her lateness.

My name is Daisy and I wet my pants last Sunday.
I have no idea when my fetish with wetting began, but ever since I was little, there&#039;s always been something magical about the desperate struggle with nature. My earliest memories of feeling attracted to someone were memories of helping a struggling friend make it to the restroom and watching her fail en route. With such a fetish for watching, I&#039;ve always been a careful soul in regards to my own bladder. I&#039;ve wet myself a couple of times as a little girl, but that&#039;s to be expected. In my middle school and high school years, I&#039;d never let myself get even remotely near the &quot;danger…</p>

        <p class="card-text">My partner and I were invited to an Old Skool rave at a friend&#039;s house last weekend. She had not initially understood the invite fully. It was obvious to me but although Val&#039;s English is excellent, it is not her first language and there are subtle cultural differences, which had eluded her. I realised that it was going to be predominantly 90&#039;s music but it was also going to be fancy dress. We were expected to go in school uniform or at least something that would pass as that.
Val was quite surprised. She has never really got her head round this schoolgirl nightclub thing. She feels that there is something odd about young women dressing as provocative schoolgirls, especially as she says the English are so…</p>

Although I would consider myself adventurous, wetting myself was not really something that interested me particularly before I met Jana. However, our first episode, which is listed in the stories as &#039;Splash Back&#039;, made me aware of how much Jana enjoyed this.
It is quite good fun I guess, in a rebellious way; and doing it always makes Jana more interested in me. I don&#039;t have a problem playing his games and it is just another, different kind of intimacy we share. I have done it when I have been on my own too, so that I get caught…</p>

        <p class="card-text">This is an absolutely true account of my experiences.
Where to start? I guess the best place to start would be second grade. That was the first time that I realized there was something I loved about seeing a girl desperate for a pee, or wetting herself. I was sitting in class one day, and a girl sitting a couple seats down from me asked permission to go to the bathroom. The teacher said okay, and the girl headed out the door. She came back after only a minute or so and sat down. Not five minutes later, we all heard a splashing sound. The girl was peeing herself! When the teacher asked her why, she said that she had been unable to undo her overalls by herself. I had the most amazing thrill, not only from…</p>

Marge and George were decorating their bedroom. The old wallpaper had been stripped off, the paintwork rubbed down, and they had been to purchase the new paint and paper. When they returned, and pulled onto the driveway, Marge went to unlock the front door while George got the goods out of the car. As he stood up he was surprised to see a young lady in obvious great discomfort approaching him. She only took small steps and yet was hurrying, clutching her abdomen.

        <p class="card-text">&quot;Sposa bagnata, sposa fortunata&quot; is a proverb from my native Italy. It means a wet wedding is lucky. Italy enjoys a fairly dry Mediterranean climate and rain is seen as a sign of fertility. I was happy to make my friend&#039;s wedding lucky.
Earlier this year a very good friend of mine, Anya, asked me to be a bridesmaid at her wedding. I was delighted to say yes and very pleased with the dresses she chose. I think this is quite difficult for an English wedding but she has exquisite taste having been in the fashion industry herself. The dress she wanted for me was a faded pink satin, beautifully made and very unfussy. It was very well cut and full enough to benefit from a hooped petticoat underneath.

God, it was hot! In fact, it was one of the hottest days I can ever remember, at least in the UK. It was so hot, you didn&#039;t want to do anything; even breathing was an effort. My friend Claire and I were sprawled on a park bench, shaded from the direct sunlight by a large tree. Neither of us had any energy at all – we&#039;d just used up what little we had drinking cold lagers in a nearby pub! 
&#039;Oh, Christ, Jen! This heat really is just too much,&#039; Claire wailed, &#039;I&#039;m absolutely busting for a piss, but I can&#039;t be bothered to move!&#039;
She could almost have been reading my mind. My own bladder was…</p>

We hope you enjoy our contributions, if not for the writing, then just for knowing that what we write is true. Hopefully others will find wetting with a partner is not an empty dream, but with the right encouragement, something intimate and enjoyable for genuinely sharing.
I have a very special relationship with my partner Val, which works very much for both of us. She modelled very successfully for a while, making very good money. She now works in the fashion industry and we have just started our own business. Although she is not turned on by wetting directly, she is happy to play my games and I hers. She will wet…</p>

Ann and Linda sat in Linda&#039;s room. They were talking about the week before when they had helped a girl overcome the taboo of peeing herself when she had to go so bad she was in extreme agony. They were also talking about the mother peeing herself to show the girl it was all right to pee herself. When they were all pissed the mother allowed the girl to pee herself when she wanted if it was possible to do it undetected and said she would be doing it as well. &quot;We need to find a way to make our mothers pee themselves with us. Perhaps they will like it too and allow us to do it when we want to so we don&#039;t have to hide our wet…</p>

Julia and Jessica had been friends since childhood. They had grown up together and were now 20 years old. They had always talked openly together about almost everything, including sexual urges and behaviour. Occasionally they indulged in wetting themselves together, for they both enjoyed feeling their bladders filling up to their capacity and sometimes they went that one bit too far. One Saturday the two were shopping in town. They had drunk several large cokes during the morning and were seated in the…</p>

Our day in the park ended up as a wet one not only for Jenny, but also for her new friend Allison, as well for me. I certainly didn&#039;t plan it that way, although I enjoyed the results. And no, we&#039;re not talking about rain here. Actually, Jenny had a bladder control problem that, while sometimes embarrassing for her, brought much delight to me. To be fair, I must note that some of her problem, maybe most of it, was of her own making. She consumed what I considered excessive amounts of bottled water and, when tired and needing energy, far too much cola. I had discovered this more than a year earlier, on our second date. We had…</p>
