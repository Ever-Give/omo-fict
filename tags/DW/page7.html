        <p class="card-text">Nancy was nothing much to look at. She was short and dumpy with freckles and glasses, and cascades of curly auburn hair tumbling down to her shoulders. She always wore her skirt about four inches above the knee, even though she plainly didn&#039;t have the legs for it; and her frumpy blouses and over–tailored jackets did absolutely nothing for her figure. But what she lacked in looks, she more than made up for in personality. She was bubbly, vivacious and fun– and about three or four years older than me.
Now, don&#039;t get me wrong: I have nothing against older women, and if the age gap had been the only thing that stood in the way of my successfully wooing her then I&#039;d have been after her like a shot. After all,…</p>

What was he doing here?? How had this happened!!?? The bailiff&#039;s voice continued, droning on in that official monotone reserved for officers of the law. Finally the explanation of charges was complete and the courtroom grew tense, quiet, as the judge&#039;s voice grimly intoned. &quot;How do you plead?&quot; Paul spat out the word &quot;innocent!&quot; in an exclamatory manner. How else did they expect him to plead? They, anyone, would understand if only they had been there! Paul&#039;s mind began to replay the…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Tamara Stevens hurried through her day, running late as usual. The 5&#039; 8&quot; tall 18–year–old college freshman was having a difficult time adjusting to life away from home. When she found herself short of time, it was usually her toilet visit that was sacrificed. Her busy class schedule, dorm living and pet–sitting job combined to leave the beautiful, bright, big bodied, but bodacious busted bubble–butt brunette&#039;s bladder being badly bursting before bathroom break (whew!) each day. Her bladder capacity did grow to accommodate her schedule, however, and became less a problem. At first, Tamara would rush to the dorm after classes to relieve her tortured body of its treasure of liquid gold, but as her capacity grew…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Lynn and Beth walked home from the club, through the warm July night. Lynn was a slender blonde with pale skin and straight hair, dressed in tight jeans and a white halter–top. Beth was shorter and rounder, with unruly brown hair to her shoulders. She wore tan pants and a flowery blouse. They were hot from dancing, and even Lynn&#039;s transparent features were slightly flushed as they walked. Feeling the buzz from beers and Bacardi Breezers, Lynn took Beth&#039;s hand and gave her a quick smile. Passing the mall they stopped to look in the windows. Lynn put her arm around Beth and pointed to a pair of jeans. –They would suit you.
— Think so?
— I&#039;ll bet your butt would look cute in them.
Beth smiled and wriggled her…</p>

I&#039;ve been reading the stories on this site since I was 18, it was such a relief for me that I wasn&#039;t the only one who was into holding my pee till I was about to or actually did wet myself. I kept meaning to share my personal experiences but I always seemed to get side tracked. Usually when I started to tell a story I&#039;d get so excited remembering what happened that well...I didn&#039;t have any fingers available for typing ;) But now I&#039;m 23 and at work, bored a lot, and I have a little more self–control.

        <p class="card-text">A few weeks earlier I had played sick and stayed home to avoid an algebra test. It was now about 10:00 pm on a Wednesday, and I was in bed but couldn&#039;t sleep. I was covered in blankets and nice and warm, but not quite warm enough. I was mildly horny because of a movie I had watched before going to bed. I did not recognize the star actor, but he was hot. At one point in the movie he kissed a beautiful redhead. I must admit that during the kiss scene I was more watching the redhead than the star actor. I wished I were she. She is so hot, with such a nice body.
So there I was, lying in bed thinking of a dramatic love scene. It was just instinctive that I rub myself. I rubbed and rubbed, and got really close to…</p>

The thrill of being in a strange town, where she could do whatever she wanted. She was dressed in a blue cotton skirt and a red t–shirt. There were other garments in her large handbag. She drank her coffee and paid her bill, then walked in the direction of the square. Her long black hair reached almost to her waist; and below her waistline the contour of her panties was visible. She preferred full–size, as everything went straight through thongs, leaving no more than a sneeze–stain. She had lived in this country for fifteen of her twenty–three years, but…</p>

The combination of cocoa and lavender scent was making her feel drowsy already, and she began to doze in next to no time.

&quot;Mmmm?&quot;
&quot;You don&#039;t mind if I join you, do you? It&#039;s just I&#039;ve not made up the bed in the spare room, and the cat&#039;s already ensconced for the night on the sofa.&quot;

        <p class="card-text">We were falling in love...all we needed was a jellyfish!
It had been a beautiful day. A group of us from work had gone for a long ramble along the coast. We were at a place called &quot;Yorkies Knob&quot; (no kidding!) near Cairns in Australia. We had had lunch under some trees listening to the endless roll of the surf. Of course it was hot, and fortunately, we had taken plenty to drink.
After lunch we all seemed to split up a bit. I realised afterwards that my friends had sensed that Alice and I needed a bit of time alone even before we even knew ourselves! Alice has lovely long dark brown hair, and an incredibly sweet smile – I always go for the smile! To be honest, I&#039;d rather assumed that she had a boyfriend…</p>

        <p class="card-text">I&#039;ve always been a bit of a dirty girl. I like to piss my panties whenever I can and even better, I love to watch a hot sexy girl lose control and piss inside her clothes. This is exactly what happened to me last summer, when I was 18.
I was on a night out with a group of friends. I was already really horny because before I had gone out, I&#039;d taken a shower, making sure I was desperate before I got in. It turned me on so much to step away from the shower and let my piss go, running down the insides of my legs until I came with pleasure.
But when we arrived at the bus stop, I saw Sophie was there, looking gorgeous and sexy. Her wonderful, full breasts were pushing to escape from her strappy top and her blue…</p>

        <p class="card-text">My girlfriend Mary has always been interested in pee play. We&#039;ve done all the usual stuff and I was looking for a new way to spice up the action. One day we got a package in the mail that had freezer gel packs to keep the contents cold. I looked at those gel packs and looked at Mary. I told her the gel packs would be part of our next bladder control scene. She got a terrified look on her face because she knew exactly what I had in mind.
That night we went to the local tavern for dinner and a few brews. I told Mary not to pee because I wanted to feel her swollen and hard bladder before we made love. She does this often and it turns us both on. We had 3 or 4 beers that night. She had no problem avoiding the…</p>

        <p class="card-text">The sunlight shone in from the east, filtering through the white curtains, casting patterns upon the hardwood floor of the upstairs bedroom. The window was open, the cool morning breeze wafting gently throughout the room, birds chirping as the new day began. Next to the window, to the left, stood a cabinet, filled with picture frames and mementos. On top of the cabinet sat an old alarm clock, manual wind, a worn cell phone, and a hairbrush. A few bobby pins lay next to the hairbrush, along with a torn piece of paper with a phone number on it. To the right of the window there was open space; only a faded picture of an old Elle magazine cover hung sloppily in a cheap frame. Within the wall to the right of the…</p>

I was shopping at the local supermarket and was packing the goods as they came through the checkout. It was quite a busy time and there was a long queue at each till. When the last items came through, I packed them up and turned to pay the cashier. As I handed over the money I heard someone say &quot;Noooo&quot; in a shrill anguished voice. I looked, and the next lady in line had her hands firmly jammed in her crotch and was doing a frantic pee–pee dance. As I collected my change she seemed to get herself under control. I turned to her and said that I sympathized with her predicament and asked her whether I could help…</p>
