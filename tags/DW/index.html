My parents didn&#039;t think I should be given a car, so usually I preferred riding my bike to school. But since that memorable day, I chose to walk home more often, benefitting from the fact that I could get a lift in the morning by a neighbor working close to my school. I knew my parents didn&#039;t expect me home at a specific time &#039; after all I was old enough to care for myself &#039; and I kept wandering along quiet roads, immersed in memories of &quot;Lady Birch&quot;: In my dreams I had needed a name for her, so I christened her after the tree standing in her front yard.At the same time, Lady Birch had started to feel qualms…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Note: This story contains Female Desperation, and Accidental &amp; Deliberate Wetting. A recent forum post asked about early experiences so perhaps I should tell about mine. I never had any problems when I was younger; as far as I can remember I never wet my knickers or my bed until my late teens, although I can recall several incidents involving friends. In most cases they wet themselves laughing, probably the main cause of accidents for teenage girls. In my case I was a poised and confident student of 19 when I first experienced the thrill and embarassment of weeing myself, though as two of my friends also soaked their pants at the same time we had a good laugh about it. The three of us had gone to an open air…</p>

She was a bubbly, outgoing character, very flirtatious and always willing to share a dirty joke or two.We were never more than work colleagues, friends I suppose, but certainly never romantically involved.It was the middle of a typical British summer and the night of the office barbecue.Surprisingly, it wasn&#039;t raining, but the promise of storms to come on the weather forecast didn&#039;t bode well.The barbecue was always held in the large garden of a pub near to the offices, and we basically took the place over for the evening.Plenty of food and plenty of drink was had by all, but eventually it was time to head for home.I had a fairly long…</p>

Day 2
The next morning Carie woke Linda up. &quot;I need to wash your leggings, or they will stain and smell.&quot; Linda dressed and gave her mother her leggings. After they walked down the stairs and into the kitchen Carie told Linda to sit down, they needed to talk. &quot;Dear, I can&#039;t thank you enough for showing me the wonders of peeing in your pants and I realise you want to do it often. Since I share that feeling I won&#039;t forbid you to wet yourself, but I do need to make a few rules for this. First, never do it on the wooden floors, they would bite out and the floor would be ruined. If you want you can go in the kitchen, but you need…</p>

Day 1 Finally it was the first evening of the festival. Ann and Linda had enjoyed themselves all day at the main event and now it was time to go for the walking. They had eaten at Linda her house (the four girls only, like each year, the husbands were at the terrain helping out as volunteers like each year) and now they had changed into the walking clothes and were ready to go out. They were all wearing the black glistering leggings, a lose t–shirt over it and sneakers with sneaker socks. The mothers had agreed it was a comfortable walking outfit and had happily paid for the whole package. Like each year they had backpacks with…</p>

&quot;What can I do for you?&quot; said Danielle to the seemingly happy young couple sitting in front of her. Having been specialised on sex–related cases directly after University about 10 years ago, the therapist wasn&#039;t used to couples holding hands during the first session. &quot;You don&#039;t seem to be too unhappy with each other!&quot;
&quot;Well&quot;, the boy started, &quot;we do love each other, and we have been together for more than five years now. It is just that our sexual fantasies seem not to match.&quot;

There were four of us in the car. I was driving and the only guy. Sitting beside me in the passenger seat was Rosemary, a longtime co–worker and years ago, my girlfriend and lover. In the back seat was Mandy, a cute although a bit overweight blonde prone to sexy outfits and too–tight stretch jeans. Next to her was Geetu, a stunningly beautiful dark complexion India–born woman with raven black hair and flashing dark eyes. She dressed more modestly than Mandy, but her tight jeans clung attractively to her lithe body. All of us worked for Acme Industrial Insurance and were returning home on a Friday afternoon…</p>

Mandy&#039;s life had changed dramatically in the past 2 months. Her boyfriend, Doug had recently asked her to move in with him and she had happily accepted. Doug&#039;s client base was growing rapidly and the law firm had gotten very busy. With the busier workdays, there had not been as much time for wet fun at work. It had gotten so busy that Doug had to hire a junior lawyer to help him keep up with the workload.
Mandy had been forced to make adjustments as well. Last month, Doug had told her he would have to hire a secretary more experienced in the law field, because of the huge call back list of clients he…</p>

Mandy had an unusual relationship with her boss and lover, Doug. Outside of work, he was everything she could ask for in a man; he was kind, passionate, and extremely fun to be with. However, the situation was a little different at work. He had requested that their relationship should be kept a secret for now, because it looked unprofessional and he was fearful of getting of being perceived as someone who took advantage of women who worked for him. He asked her to continue to address him as Mr. Welsh at work and not to show any public displays of affection at the office. He promised her that he would tell…</p>

In a half–hour she wakes up and we start talking. Her name is Lori and she is very easy to talk to, and we were having a good time until I see her start to squirm. Lori admits she really needs to pee and gets up to ask the driver to stop, then comes back with a very worried look on her face.
We talk some more, but Lori is getting frantic, and starts to bounce in her seat. And I am getting very turned on. Finally she reaches her limit, &quot;Oh…</p>

I work for a large manufacturing company in the UK, and management had decided that we were to have a three–day team training exercise. We were to spend the three team training days at a large hotel in the country, all expenses paid, and most of us were quite excited at the idea. After all, the company was paying and it was a break from the normal daily routine.
Well, the day came and we all boarded the luxurious coaches that had been laid on and after a journey of about an hour and a half, we arrived at the hotel.…</p>

I&#039;m sure phone sex has been around since shortly after Alexander Graham Bell invented the telephone. Certainly the proliferation of cell phones has increased phone sex activity exponentially, making this popular past time available to billions of people almost anywhere and anytime. 
But what about phone wetting? The desperation of someone at the other end of the call, trying to hold it and bursting for a pee, can be almost as exciting as seeing your favorite woman pee her pants. In fact, phone wetting can be more exciting than phone sex. Whereas phone sex, of necessity, must be staged by the parties at both ends of the call–…</p>

Rachel threw the last of her papers and other items into her briefcase and muttered &quot;Thank fuck for that!&quot; This was swiftly followed by &quot;Ow! Shit!&quot; as, slamming the lid shut, she trapped the fleshy part of the heel of her hand between the lid and the base. She sucked the wound ruefully; although she hadn&#039;t drawn blood, she expected that there would be a blood blister there later. God, what a day it had been; what a week, in fact. It had been all about stress, pressure, with a liberal helping of frustration thrown in for good measure; she was glad it was finally over, for the weekend, at least. But who knew what…</p>

&quot;Won,&quot; Eve triumphed smiling, for the third time in a row. Emma looked surprised at empty checkerboard on the table between them and muttered: &quot;Just luck, nothing more! I bet you cannot win another time?&quot; Eve looked out the train window. &quot;Hey Emma, at what time will our train arrive?&quot; &quot;Do not worry,&quot; Emma said, &quot;it is still more than a half hour drive down to Marseilles, and we have plenty of time left.&quot; &quot;Ok well I agree, just one game, but that&#039;s also the last!&quot; Eve replied. &quot;And then I quickly go to the bathroom,&quot; she added in her…</p>

Ever since my last accident, I&#039;d been thinking on how to best go about my next wetting. Every idea just seemed too bold for me. I liked what I felt to a certain extent, but most of my initial ideas would potentially put me in very socially dangerous situations. I kept arguing with myself in that regard, because it is entirely the point to feel that danger. The simple release is nothing without thought of losing it, the fear of utter humiliation.
That&#039;s when I came up with my plan. I wanted to pee in front of someone but have it not matter. I wanted to experience the urgency of a consequence to flooding my pants.…</p>
