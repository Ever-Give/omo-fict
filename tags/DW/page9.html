        <p class="card-text">Sarah stood in front of the mirror, her heart beating, her hands trembling. She looked at herself, a brown–haired girl with a white sweater and a denim skirt, with smallish breasts, narrow waist and round hips; a quite ordinary–looking girl of nineteen. Then she lifted her skirt and revealed her panties, and under them, the bulkiness of diapers. Sarah had been looking after her friend Anne&#039;s two–year–old daughter for some time while Anne worked odd shifts at the hospital. Once, as Anne had showed her where the diapers were kept, Sarah had noticed another package. Anne had laughed, a little bit embarrassed, and said she had had some problems after giving birth, you know, leaking a little... Sarah had been…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Susan and Gemma were returning home from a Friday night trip into town. They had met some friends in a bar where they had enjoyed a pint or two before someone had suggested a visit to a beer festival just down the road. On arrival several of their party had disappeared to the loos while Gemma and Susan went to get a round in. As they met up again one of the other girls said she did not recommend the toilets, as they were disgusting. In fact they were just a portacabin each for the men and for the women and both were totally inadequate for the number of visitors to the festival that night.
Gemma already needed a wee but decided to wait a while. After their third pint of the evening she decided that she couldn…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Homer Snikshot is a lucky man. This document begins the arduous and exhausting work, which chronicles the adventures of the infamous couple consisting of Homer Rufus Snikshot and Matilda Lou Cravencrotch. Matilda is considered a demure little thing in some circles. Say, a circle of hairy mastodons, which, coincidentally, are a pretty good likeness of the ...ahem ...little lady. But, being fair to the mastodons, if she had come along first they would now be known simply as mastodons. She is, as they are called in polite society, a large and lovely, albeit hairy, lady. How large, you inquire? If she had been around when toilets were invented they certainly wouldn&#039;t have been put in a closet and the pipes would…</p>

        <p class="card-text">I have an algebra test today, but I didn&#039;t study. This morning I woke up by the ringing of the alarm clock, but just knew I wasn&#039;t going to school. I am a senior, and failing this test could be the end of my academic career. I thought of a way out; I would pretend to be sick. I didn&#039;t do this often because I was a good girl... overall. I rarely needed to make excuses, but today was the exception.
The alarm rang for about three minutes before mom came in. She shook me, and asked me if I was awake. I was, of course, but I pretended not to be. After a few seconds, I rose suddenly, and sat up. I told mom of my upset stomach, and my throbbing head. She had no reason to doubt me since I almost never missed school.…</p>

She peered outside at the early summer day, clouds puffy and white in the sky, people walking along the busy street in the harried pace of the office employee, heads down, moving with purpose along the sidewalks. Moving from the window to her dining table, she picked up her resume and read it once again, double–checking for spelling errors and considering yet again rewriting her summary to put a different slant on her skills. The interview was at 12:00 noon downtown, about a mile away from her upscale apartment and Jenny was nervous. She needed a job, and the economic woes had made them scarce to come…</p>

A quick phone call to the Gym had renewed her lapsed membership and now she had called in at the mall to pick up some new workout clothes.
Joan&#039;s taste didn&#039;t run to anything flashy – just an oversize tee shirt and a pair of shorts, but a good sports bra was essential. The sports store had a good selection. Joan was admiring some bras in a pleasing shade of blue Lycra when an enthusiastic sales assistant came bouncing up to her.
&quot;That&#039;s our best–selling line. I even wear them myself.&quot;

When the girl emerged from her soaking she looked as embarrassed as hell, her face red and obviously quite close to tears. The two friends watched her step out of the water, her jeans and blue t–shirt clinging and shining on her body, water pouring off of them.

She had gone to a few concerts before, and it was my first time, so I looked to her to know what to do and what to wear. She told me to wear a knee–length skirt and thick panties underneath. On top I should wear something lose, not tucked into my skirt. I looked trough my wardrobe and found the outfit she described. When the big day finally arrived we went to the concert area early so we would have a real good spot. My sister told me to go to the bathroom now; for we wouldn&#039;t be able to go until the show was over if we wanted the spot.

Since the day had been exhausting, I had gone to bed early and happily in diapers. My subconscious seemed to have grasped the fact, for that night I wasn&#039;t plagued by bad dreams of searching desperately for a toilet, while the pressure in my bladder grew worse and worse – but I guess you know this type of nightmares. No, I slept like a log…</p>

        <p class="card-text">She had been watching me for some time. She sat alone by a column drinking beer, and caught my eyes a couple of times, lifting her glass to me. She was dressed in a short skirt and tight top, had dark, curly hair, and was not very tall. Her clothes accentuated her rounded body, and her skirt rode up to reveal the top of her stay–up pantyhose. A woman in her thirties on the lookout.I was sitting by the bar, ready to be selected. I lifted my glass and nodded to her. The music was loud. She put her hands to her red mouth and mouthed, &quot;dance?&quot; and I finished my beer and rose. She came into my arms, almost sliding into place, and I felt soft breasts brush my stomach and a deliberate pressure against my groin. My…</p>

        <p class="card-text">A Few Good Stories While I Wait
So, I&#039;m sitting here on my day off doing absolutely nothing. Well, not nothing...I&#039;m listening to music and looking at dirty pictures on the Internet. A pastime I don&#039;t tell anyone about. I also have a very full bladder...another hobby I don&#039;t tell anyone about.
I am so wet right now that my pants are damp, although I haven&#039;t actually lost control yet. Really, I&#039;ve never gotten that far. Whether it&#039;s from fear, boredom, or intolerance to pain, I don&#039;t know, but I&#039;ve tried countless times. I always end up giving in and getting on the toilet. Maybe this time...

        <p class="card-text">When Ian and Lucy had gone, Joan, who at the time was managing the shop, summoned one of the assistants to look after the shop, and then made her way to her office. She was about to sit down, when she remembered that the panties she had on were wet, and would mark her skirt. She was about to remove them when suddenly the memory of what she had witnessed looking through the spy hole in the changing cubical, came back with vivid lucidity. In her mind&#039;s eye she again saw Lucy with her legs wrapped round Ian&#039;s waist, his prick squashed up the leg of the panties thrust in her pleasure hole pumping in and out of Lucy&#039;s cunt, and how the stimulated girl had been unable to refrain from pissing when she came, soaking…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Debbie was running as fast as she could through the concourse. Well, running was being generous considering how tight her short little skirt was. As the athlete amongst her group of friends it bothered her that she was lagging yards behind them. They all just had to catch this train otherwise they&#039;d be stranded in New York for at least three hours. Plus on top of all that she had to pee like you wouldn&#039;t believe – no, Debbie wasn&#039;t too happy right now. It had all started innocently enough, Debbie and three of her postgrad classmates from Princeton had decided to go into the city that evening and hit the clubs. Debbie, Jennifer, Suzi and Shanique had ridden the train in earlier that evening, had a great dinner…</p>
