When I got home after college Eve and Ann were waiting for me in the living room. They had put a blanket on the floor and told me I had to stand on it while I peed my jeans. I felt so turned on. I had just come home, with my coat and backpack still on and I could wet my pants now. I didn&#039;t hesitate, without taking anything off I stepped on the blanket and slightly spread my legs. Ann said something like, &#039;Oh my God, she is going to do it completely dressed, with even her backpack on,&#039; and then I relaxed. I felt it coming soon enough. It erupted against my panties, making it jet back at…</p>

At work we have a strict policy. You can surf and mail work related and mail privately as well if it doesn&#039;t take up to much work time. Porn is strictly forbidden. As head of the IT department I had to check this from time to time. All Internet pages visited were logged on both who visited and how long they stayed if they were not in the approved list. I checked the log twice a week and if a site was clearly work related I added it to the list immediately. If it was on the edge of work related but not in violation of work codes (porn) I added it to a second list where the maximum visit…</p>

Michaela awoke to the feeling of Alyssa nibbling on her ear.
&quot;Morning sunshine, how are you feeling?&quot; Alyssa asked.
&quot;I feel fine,&quot; Michaela replied before turning over her body to look Alyssa in the eyes.
All the feelings of sheer embarrassment from the night before just washed away when she looked at her best friend. She kissed Aly on the lips and smiled. 
&quot;What do you wanna do today?&quot;
&quot;Well we don&#039;t have anywhere to be for a couple days, we could have a lil fun, yeah sweetie?&quot;
&quot;Like what kind of fun?&quot; Michaela asked
Alyssa sat up and crawled out of bed. She walked over to Michaela&#039;s closet and started…</p>

The next day my parents were going to a wine shop to get estimates on the worth of the wine. They were going with my grandparents and were planning on making a day out of it. I stayed behind and went into the secret area. When I was in the cellar I heard the doorbell and it was Monica. I opened the door from the inside and told her to come in through my living room. When she was with me she asked me why I wanted her to come in that way. I told her I didn&#039;t want anyone to find out about this secret place, so as few doors as we needed had to be used. The only door that opened inwards was my room; the…</p>

        <p class="card-text">As the three women were lying in the sun after their lunch, a girl came riding along on her bicycle. With her long, shiny hair, her slender and athletic but well–rounded figure, and her –as usual – fashionable style of dress she was the siren boys might die for. She was living in the next village and not especially fond of Marianne, although she knew the girl liked her. At present, she was disappointed to see the group of women here, where she had thought to take a quick pee break in the bunker. She knew about the vagabond living there and as she did not like vagabonds she wanted to annoy him by peeing into his treasured home. She was relieved to see the three women were almost asleep and as it seemed, naked.…</p>

Michaela jolted up in bed as her deafening alarm clock started to beep. She quickly silenced the alarm and rubbed her eyes, it was a little past 4 pm and she was supposed to meet her roommate Alyssa for a late lunch down the street. The two girls worked together as bartenders at a trendy nightclub nearby. Michaela didn&#039;t get home until 6 am that morning but tonight was the beginning of their weekend and she intended to put it to good use. Michaela crawled out from under the covers revealing her smooth tan legs, She was about 5&#039;&quot;7&quot; and weighed around 108. She ran her fingers through her shoulder length…</p>

Sophie had other, more pressing matters on her mind, such as her hard earned career crashing to the ground. All her efforts destroyed in an instant, and all because of one damn picture. The image flashed back into her mind again as she squirmed slightly in her chair. All those frills, all that lace, and those two shiny stilettos with that huge ...

        <p class="card-text">It all started for me when I moved with my parents to the town my mother grew up in. We went living next to my uncle and aunt, but more importantly my niece Caroline. It was the beginning of the summer–vacation when we moved, so my parents had time to settle down in the new house before they had to start working again. This gave me the time to get to know the town a bit better and to make some friends before school started. Caroline showed me around and introduced me to some of her friends. We spent a lot of time together and grew quite close. One day we decided to go to the beach together, well beach is a somehow big word. It was a river with a bit of sand on the shores.

The Girls
Andi: the driver, and leader of the group. It&#039;s her dad&#039;s Camaro that they&#039;ve borrowed for the day. Andi&#039;s got a fantastic body – she is all curves, with none of them too big or too small, just perfectly proportioned. Her hair was a sandy blonde to begin with, and she&#039;s improved on it with pure–blonde highlights; today she&#039;s wearing it in a classic ponytail. At the moment she&#039;s wearing a blue bikini (to match her eyes) with tight jean cut offs over it, plus flip–flops and sunglasses. Andi is a fairly dominant personality, take–charge, very self–confident.
Cassie: tall and leggy (5&#039;10&quot;), with cute freckles. She used…</p>

One day I had to go to a business meeting in another town. For this meeting one of my female co–workers had to go with me. This co–worker was a close friend of mine; I&#039;ll call her Amy. Amy and I were kidding around a lot of the time, and my boss tried to let us work together as little as possible, for we wouldn&#039;t do much at all if we were together all the time. We were however, the best people in the business and we had to close this deal. At work we had the joy of working with a lot of people, so they were sad to see us go. We were going to go away for at least a month.
One day we were going to a meeting and she said she had…</p>

Laura was sitting in the folding chair, filming Gillian as she was holding Marianne and felt her body quiver with lust and expectation, but also with the urgent need to pee. They had been hiking almost two hours now, and the nice pee break behind the picturesque chapel had been before they started. Laura felt the three litres of water she had drunk in the meantime filling her bladder to full capacity. She was on the verge of letting go; she wanted to pee right in the chair she sat in. Thinking about this she realized Marianne could look right up her crotch since she wasn&#039;t…</p>

Carrie and Brad were a happy couple in their late twenties, their strong marriage made stronger by a great sex life.
Carrie was slim and fit; she&#039;d been a swimmer in school. She was small–breasted with a tight butt and gorgeous natural blonde hair. Brad was taller and more substantial, oftentimes looming over her, but she was the more forceful personality; Brad was a gentle soul, but with a mischievous streak.
Carrie was not terribly pee–shy; she&#039;d grown up with three brothers, and when they&#039;d been small they&#039;d routinely peed in front of each other. So Carrie was never overly concerned about anyone seeing her…</p>

It was a sisters&#039; night out. They stayed at the bar a couple of hours, drinking, looking at guys and chatting about recent events (except for Elizabeth and Alyssa don&#039;t share certain secrets with their little sister). Then they decided it was late and went home. Michelle took a bus, while Elizabeth walked Alyssa to their mother&#039;s home, since her sister was pretty drunk. Considering that their mother was out on a trip, she decided to stay all night with her sister, so they took a cab and headed home. Alyssa was barely able to stay awake during the trip, and…</p>

Carlee really enjoys her new job as a meter reader for the public works department. She had always been an outdoors type, but not like the earthy women one usually associates with this stereotype. Carlee was 23–years–old, fresh out of university and working towards a career in municipal government. She thought that starting out with a first job as a meter reader would enable her to get real–world experience in local government as well as helping her keep fit. At the same time, she also thought that this job would allow her to indulge in her fetish of desperation and panty wetting, without anyone knowing.
Carlee is about 5&#039;6&quot; tall, with medium–length auburn hair and a great smile. Her…</p>

Allie stood in her room; blushing so hard you could see it through her brown hair that cluttered her face. Kelli walked away, making sure the dark blue panties were a little bit up her ass for her sister to see, as she walked into her room. Allie stood there, knowing that Kelli had something planned from the glimmer in her eye. She cautiously walked over to her sister&#039;s door, which was open, but was dark inside. She stood there, looking in the room for Kelli, but couldn&#039;t find her. She…</p>
