        <p class="card-text">I had known Alice&#039;s secret for almost two weeks by now, and I still did not know what to do!
I was working in a PC repair shop as a summer holiday job. After doing any hardware repairs, we would regularly scan the PC&#039;s for viruses and other dodgy software. Of course, we found all sorts of other things on people&#039;s hard disks, but unless it was illegal, we never even mentioned it to the customer. Of course, if anything illegal had turned up, it would have gone straight to the police – but that left a lot of other interesting things!
This particular customer, called Alice, had brought her PC in because it was freezing every few minutes. Alice said her PC contained her university work, and she was quite…</p>

        <p class="card-text">I pulled up to the address on my work ticket, and went to the door and knocked. She opened the door. &#039;Wow,&#039; I thought to myself. She was wearing a pair of tight denim shorts over black shiny hose. Her red top was tight on her body, and showed her full female form. She looked great at that moment. But she had a bounce to her step, like she was agitated about something. 
I asked her where the air conditioner was so I could start my task and distract myself from her tightly wrapped body. She told me she would show me what I needed in a minute. She offered me a glass of water and I accepted, and she poured herself one too. When she thought I couldn&#039;t see her, I saw her cross her legs a bit, and shoot a hand to…</p>

When I got home after college Eve and Ann were waiting for me in the living room. They had put a blanket on the floor and told me I had to stand on it while I peed my jeans. I felt so turned on. I had just come home, with my coat and backpack still on and I could wet my pants now. I didn&#039;t hesitate, without taking anything off I stepped on the blanket and slightly spread my legs. Ann said something like, &#039;Oh my God, she is going to do it completely dressed, with even her backpack on,&#039; and then I relaxed. I felt it coming soon enough. It erupted against my panties, making it jet back at…</p>

At work we have a strict policy. You can surf and mail work related and mail privately as well if it doesn&#039;t take up to much work time. Porn is strictly forbidden. As head of the IT department I had to check this from time to time. All Internet pages visited were logged on both who visited and how long they stayed if they were not in the approved list. I checked the log twice a week and if a site was clearly work related I added it to the list immediately. If it was on the edge of work related but not in violation of work codes (porn) I added it to a second list where the maximum visit…</p>

The next day my parents were going to a wine shop to get estimates on the worth of the wine. They were going with my grandparents and were planning on making a day out of it. I stayed behind and went into the secret area. When I was in the cellar I heard the doorbell and it was Monica. I opened the door from the inside and told her to come in through my living room. When she was with me she asked me why I wanted her to come in that way. I told her I didn&#039;t want anyone to find out about this secret place, so as few doors as we needed had to be used. The only door that opened inwards was my room; the…</p>

Laura was sitting in the folding chair, filming Gillian as she was holding Marianne and felt her body quiver with lust and expectation, but also with the urgent need to pee. They had been hiking almost two hours now, and the nice pee break behind the picturesque chapel had been before they started. Laura felt the three litres of water she had drunk in the meantime filling her bladder to full capacity. She was on the verge of letting go; she wanted to pee right in the chair she sat in. Thinking about this she realized Marianne could look right up her crotch since she wasn&#039;t…</p>

I had made an unplanned visit to Aunt May, in the Midlands, but she was away for the weekend and Jilly and Jenny from across the street were house sitting. After discovering they were playing &#039;how long can we hold it&#039; we had a very enjoyable evening, and I agreed to stay the night and start the day off with them on equal footings.
We got up the next morning, peed and showered together. We had great fun with squeals of delight as we soaped and lathered each other.

She had met Bernard–Henri on holiday the previous summer, and they had fallen madly in love. But he lived in Paris, and she lived in London. They both had demanding jobs, and neither was prepared to give up their career in order to be together. So it had been a long–distance relationship. Passionate phone–calls, highly explicit e–mails and whenever they could afford it, a day, a weekend or a short holiday together. Now that the Eurostar took only a little over two hours…</p>

Aunt May was always happy to put up anyone who dropped in, whether they were expected or not, so I decided to surprise her and turn up unannounced. I arrived about 7pm on Friday evening, knocked the door, walked in and shouted &quot;Hi!&quot;
I was a little surprised when a young female voice shouted back, &quot;Who&#039;s that?&quot; I walked into the lounge and saw that Jenny and Jilly were sitting on the sofa with no sign of Aunt May. Jenny and Jilly were identical twins that lived across the road from Aunt May. They were about 23 years old and were absolutely gorgeous. &quot;Oh, Hi Gord,&quot; said Jilly, &quot;Your…</p>

The way it was advertised was that music would be going all day and well into the night, with vendors selling food, arts &amp; crafts, and the like. Jenny and I are both into country music, and are kind of the outdoorsy types.
I fell in love with this girl a couple years ago when we were seniors in high school. We had flirted around for a couple of months when a mutual friend finally hooked us up. I couldn&#039;t believe my luck that this slender, athletic blonde country girl wanted to hook up with me.

        <p class="card-text">Kelli stood outside her sister&#039;s doorway, piss still dripping from the panties her older sister was recently wearing, her red hair laying down over her shoulders and green eyes almost shimmering. Kelli giggled slightly.
Allie stood in her room; blushing so hard you could see it through her brown hair that cluttered her face. Kelli walked away, making sure the dark blue panties were a little bit up her ass for her sister to see, as she walked into her room. Allie stood there, knowing that Kelli had something planned from the glimmer in her eye. She cautiously walked over to her sister&#039;s door, which was open, but was dark inside. She stood there, looking in the room for Kelli, but couldn&#039;t find her. She…</p>

        <p class="card-text">It was a cool autumn day when 25 year old Melissa stood on her friend&#039;s doorstep, her long black hair blowing across her sexy eyes in the brisk breeze. Mel is the type of girl that has &quot;the eyes.&quot; &quot;The eyes&quot; are the type of eyes that can give a super sexy look and get anyone to do anything. She fidgeted with her panties for a moment as they were riding into her crotch cause she liked to wear tight satin panties. These ones were blue with flower prints on them under her baby pink mini skirt. She made sure her tits looked nice and perky in her matching pink halter–top and knocked on the door. After she knocked on the door she realized pulling her panties out of her pussy made her horny and she shifted her legs.…</p>

Since her empathic abilities had developed she sensed she was destined to meet her soul mate, the women she would join with for life, but it never happened. Then she started working for the Paltathion Ministry of Education, only to be arrested for murder. And then she had believed she could postpone her execution indefinitely by giving herself to Cota, but now even that had failed.
Gabri–Ann sensed the jailers were coming with a new prisoner, and she combed her short blond hair and straightened her robe before they entered. The new prisoner was wearing an officer&#039;s uniform of the Imperial…</p>

Cathy and I were together for over three years. She was attractive, warm, kind, intelligent and witty. Everything a man could want, it might seem. Unfortunately not, if a man had tastes like mine. As far as my preferred fantasies were concerned, she was a sad disappointment. She wasn&#039;t shy or inhibited in any way; she would announce, &quot;I&#039;m going to the toilet&quot; in a quite matter–of–fact tone. But that was all. Never did she admit to being &quot;desperate&quot; or &quot;bursting,&quot; or to any kind of urgency. Sometimes when we came home she would head to the bathroom without delay, but never did she offer the slightest comment – &quot;I…</p>

&quot;Yeah it is,&quot; her friend Mandy replied. Summer&#039;s brain stopped for a second before she realized that she was thinking out loud.
&quot;So what are we going to do?&quot; Summer asked, her long blonde hair falling almost seductively over her face, sweat dripping from her shoulders down under her tank top, making her 36 Cs glisten under the hot sun. The only thing on her that wasn&#039;t sweaty was her toned, tan legs, which looked especially sexy in her short pink &amp; white striped satin basketball shorts. For being 25 she definitely looked like she could still be in high school and yet would get any guy&#039;s testosterone…</p>
