        <p class="card-text">Barbara awoke slightly aware that something was wrong– her eyes flicked open, and she was not sitting in a country gateway with her panties round her ankles. She was in bed, with alarm bells sounding in her mind. Her hand went down to her panty crotch to confirm what her waking mind already knew. She had wet the bed!
She had been dreaming that she had been out walking her new baby son Mark around the countryside in his pushchair. She had somehow gotten lost, and was unsure about which way to go to find the quickest way home. Above all she really needed to wee but was unsure of the length of time it would be till she could make it all the way home.
Her need had suddenly become urgent and with her pelvic…</p>

I&#039;m twirling around, somewhat slowly, finishing a decidedly amateur version of a camel back spin, the announcer blaring that &quot;open ice is over&quot;. The other skaters begin to clear the ice, the overprotective mothers hovering over their next superstar wunderkind child, the harried parents yelling at their hopefully NHL destined little boy, the romantic couples skating a few extra laps lazily around the rink, arm in arm, seemingly oblivious to the announcers call. The dusk sky slowly rolls in, yet it&#039;s still somewhat warm out. The rink, a public outdoors facility, shuts down early on Fridays for maintenance. I&#039;m still amazed they kept it running today. While the ice was a little slippery,…</p>

The strong smell of chlorine fills the air. The concrete walls echo with the screaming of children, teens and nervous parents. It&#039;s two o&#039;clock and my shift is over. I survey the scene on this busy Saturday; take the empty water bottle with me as my replacement shows up. As I climb down the ladder from the watch chair I&#039;m aware how badly I need to use the bathroom. No breaks today, another lifeguard called in sick, and it&#039;s been four hours without a pee break, and with as much water as I had, I&#039;m about to burst. My red lifeguard bathing suit fits tightly over my 5&#039; 6&quot; body, my long dark hair tied up in a bun. I fidget as I sign out, the tight fabric of my bathing suit clinging to my…</p>

This document begins the arduous and exhausting work, which chronicles the adventures of the infamous couple consisting of Homer Rufus Snikshot and Matilda Lou Cravencrotch. Matilda is considered a demure little thing in some circles. Say, a circle of hairy mastodons, which, coincidentally, are a pretty good likeness of the ...ahem ...little lady. But, being fair to the mastodons, if she had come along first they would now be known simply as mastodons. She is, as they are called in polite society, a large and lovely, albeit hairy, lady.

        <p class="card-text">After what had seemed like an interminable Friday of classes at the NYU Downtown Campus, Katie McDonald, a 21–year–old graduate student in political economics, neatly arranged her books and materials in her tote pack and strode confidently out toward Washington Square. During the walk, she exchanged pleasantries with her classmates Rita Kudner and Boyd Hamilton, though declined an invitation to a student sleepover at someone&#039;s parents&#039; house on the Upper East Side. Katie had other things in mind.
Nearing the park, Katie managed to disengage from Rita and Boyd, who were heading for the subway. She strode over to a bench on the west side of the park, straightened her medium–length navy blue skirt and India…</p>

This is a true f/f event 
After we had shopped ourselves out around the boutiques of Bristol, we sat in a coffee shop to talk. I was inquisitive as to whether or not Fiona was really into watersports, or it had just been a way for her now obvious lesbian tendencies to manifest themselves when we had been in the toilet cubicle. She told me that she had been wetting herself for about two and a half years, ever since she had not reached a toilet in time, and she had enjoyed the experience. When I explained to her, that in addition to enjoying the feeling of being wet, that I also liked wearing a nappy and plastic or rubber pants, Fiona was intrigued. She wanted to know when and where I…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Karen, Mia and I had been friends since going to college at Ohio State University. We had all had a few serious dating relationships since college, but always seemed to get back together when those relationships failed.
This weekend we rented a cabin and a rowboat in the woods near a small lake in West Virginia. The cabin included just the bare necessities, and was pretty isolated from the rest of the campers on the lake.
We started drinking beer about 7:00 pm, and decided to take the rowboat out for a trip around the lake. We took a cooler of beer with us, and headed out to explore the lake. Blond haired, blue–eyed Karen was wearing a white t–shirt, a pair of loose fitting blue and white cotton shorts, and…</p>

You see, Ashley loved to piss her pants and panties; she loved the feeling of holding a full bladder as long as she could. But one thing she loved even more was the satisfaction of being humiliated and embarrassed while being seen in public. She got horny at the thought.
So Ashley came up with a brilliant plan, she had asked for a study session with Mrs. Ross, a middle aged blonde haired woman, who was quite attractive. Ashley chose her for two reasons– one: the thought of wetting herself in front of her hot biology teacher made her insanely horny, and two: the fact that Mrs. Ross had some strict rules…</p>

In her 18th year, my middle daughter was a real knockout. She was tall and slender and kept after herself. As I look back, I miss all those girly things like shampoo and perfume smells, her music playing and her giggling with her friends when she filled the house with other pretty teens. Sometimes her friends would do the courteous thing and say hello to &quot;the Dad&quot; or give a nod or wink.

        <p class="card-text">I have been peeing for ten years, but only by myself at home. This is the first time I have had the experience of playing with anyone else.
Fiona arrived at my house at 7am for the 100–mile drive to Bristol for the shopping expedition that we had planned. I had known Fiona for about 20 years as the fairly attractive, but quiet daughter of my fathers&#039; friends, but up until recently we had not really been friends, only acquaintances, which had changed after meeting by chance in the pub three months ago.
We drove up the motorway in good spirits, looking forward to the day&#039;s shopping ahead. I was already starting to feel a little pressure on my bladder following the three cups on coffee I had drunk before…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Linda didn&#039;t know why she enjoyed wetting herself. She only knew the secret pleasure of letting go into her panties. The sensual release she felt as the wet patch at her crotch moved up and down the inside of her thighs, spreading a comfortable warmth in her most sensitive areas. For years, she had reveled in the shameful naughtiness of the act, but she did not try to understand it.
Maybe that was all there was to it, she thought to herself as she lay on her bed, idly fondling the crotch of her jeans. Linda looked at her watch and frowned. Her girlfriends were supposed to call her when they were ready to meet. If they didn&#039;t come soon, they were going to miss the movie.
No matter, she decided. She had…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Nathan said, &quot;How did that happen when you two are always pissing about?&quot; He said it as a joke when I told him I was pregnant. We had gone by car to see him and AnnaMarie after the summer tour was over. They suggested we should come and help them celebrate November 5th and I&#039;d found out about my pregnancy the previous week. My reply seemed to cause great amusement when I said, &quot;It must have happened one night.&quot;
I didn&#039;t see what was so funny, it could have been the day Robert said he felt we were stuck in a rut and we did it in a bus shelter or it might have been the afternoon the gas man came and just missed us being disgraceful in the back of the van in our own driveway. We had quite an active week back…</p>

I was with a unit of Army personnel that I am not regularly attached to. I happened to begin talking to the most attractive Specialist and the word PEE was tossed out during conversation. I won&#039;t bore you with all that led up to that point, let&#039;s just say I took the opportunity and &quot;ran&quot; with it. I usually try to relate something to myself or someone else that I know, and this time I used my ex–wife. Knowing that I could relate pregnancy to peeing, I told her how my ex hated to sneeze or laugh too hard because it would cause her to wet her pants, sometimes a small…</p>

As an upper division life sciences major, I had been finally granted the coveted privilege of access to Tulane&#039;s renowned Herkimer Primate Biology Research Center. Joanna wasn&#039;t much older than I, but she had been one of those prodigies who had been granted admission to New Orleans prestigious Newcombe College immediate after her sophomore year in high school, and was currently engaged in the research underlying her doctoral thesis.
There was nothing at all pretentious in her manner as Joanna showed me around the laboratory adjacent to Herkimer&#039;s famous outdoor observation facility. I followed her with rapt…</p>
