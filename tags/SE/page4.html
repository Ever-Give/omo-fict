        <p class="card-text">Margaret shifted her weight, a carefully neutral expression on her face. She tugged at my sleeve and I leaned towards her, feeling the heat of her breath on my ear as she hissed quietly, &quot;Let&#039;s get out of here. I&#039;m not gonna make it if this queue keeps stalling like this.&quot;
I nodded. The queue to the loos was truly impressive; people in various stages of discomfort were watching their places like hawks to ensure a few minutes of privacy in the smelly bluish interior of a porta–potty. Marge and I lined up ten minutes ago and we still were too far from the plastic grails, and when I say &quot;we,&quot; I mean my wife, because I for one hadn&#039;t been drinking ale.
Walking stiffly, Margaret followed me away from the…</p>

I have been living in Portland, Oregon for some time now and I like to go out and have a drink at a bar called Thatcher&#039;s. I have never known where the restroom is and as I particularly don&#039;t like to use the toilet anyway I have never asked.
Well one day I left home and caught a bus. I stood out at that bus stop for what seemed forever when I began to realize I needed to go pee. I was meeting someone at Thatcher&#039;s and didn&#039;t want to be late so I decided to wait until I got to the bar and hopefully would find a quiet corner to pee in. As the bus came down the hill I was dancing back and forth trying…</p>

One day, 19–year–old Allie was sitting home alone in the summer time, just hanging out in her short denim skirt and pink camisole (and if you were looking up her skirt you would see her dark blue cotton bikini panties.) She sat there on the couch bored, watching TV and sipping at her Coke. She was quite a naughty and promiscuous girl, and got anyone she wanted when she wanted them...it wasn&#039;t too hard for her; all she had to do was throw her long, brunette hair over her shoulder and smile her shiny lips at somebody, show off her perfect white teeth with the glitter in her brown eyes and she had them.

        <p class="card-text">Once upon a time there was a princess named Ella who had just turned 18. She was allowed to move out at age 18 so she found a nice castle thousands of miles away from the King and Queen and decided to move there. After getting settled into the castle, Ella realized that she would need some servants. She had also always wanted some personal companions who would keep her company and who would be her friends if she so wanted them to. So she looked through the phone book to find what she was looking for. She came upon a rather odd listing. There was a picture of four women in their 20&#039;s who were offering to come live with someone and attend to their every need, including just being a companion or best friend if so…</p>

        <p class="card-text">A few months ago my friend Melinda had given me a cigarette lighter. When she gave it to me I didn&#039;t smoke, so I thought it was a little weird. I guess because it led me to my first cigarette, I was not complaining– just curious. Why would she give such an odd gift?
I got the answer today.
Yesterday, Melinda and I were at the picnic table at school. We were just talking and gossiping as usual. As she did everyday, she opened the secret pocket in her book bag and pulled out a cigarette. She walked down to the &quot;smokers ditch&quot; and puffed away. As always, I followed her. As usual I seemed out of place in the smokers ditch. All of the others were Punks and Heads, the few that were lucky to have somehow gotten…</p>

She sat there thinking how it was Thursday, wishing it were Friday so she could go clubbing. It wasn&#039;t worth going on Thursday nights, though; the clubs weren&#039;t even half packed.

When I was eighteen, I spent four weeks in hospital after falling off a roof and breaking both arms, dislocating one and giving my back a nasty jolt. I spent quite a lot of this time with my arms encased in itchy plaster and suspended by wires to prevent me from moving them. I was lucky that my father had the kind of job that offered good medical cover, and I had a private room. To be honest, I would rather have been in one of the wards with other kids my age so that I would have had people to talk to, but since the insurance company was paying, my dad wanted me to have the best.

She had taken an interest in the country and the culture from travel documentaries on TV, and recently she had begun taking lessons in speaking Japanese.
We decided to meet one evening after work to decide. We would discuss the matter over a few pale ales, persuading each other with pictures from brochures and well–reasoned arguments. She thought Vegas was tacky and decadent (exactly the point, I thought). I thought Japan would be too…</p>

        <p class="card-text">It was finally the end of the day on Friday and Nikki was more than ready for the weekend. It had been a rough week at work and Nikki was ready for two days of relaxation and time with Tyler. To prepare herself she had been drinking lots of water all afternoon. Of course, she had had to pee several times in order not to embarrass herself at the office, but that was OK. She knew she was well hydrated and that she now only needed to drink a little to fill her bladder enough to make her hot and intensify her horniness.
She stopped in the staff kitchen on her way out of the office to fill up her water bottle and then headed out to the car. On the way home she fantasized about what she might do with Tyler tonight.…</p>

Doctor Annabel Hart. The pretty young redhead&#039;s green eyes sparkled as she stared in amazement at the shingle hanging outside her office. She had thought, more than once, that this day would never come. Still, she had persevered, working long hours to support her schooling and even longer hours to pass medical school. The sleepless nights and heavy schedule had granted Annabel her most intense desire, but at the price of any social life. In fact she had no friends outside the stodgy little medical school she had attended. She thought it was worth it. Social opportunities would come when she…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Lee lies still, awake enough to know she needs to pee, but not enough to actually do anything about it. She watches as her friend Donna stirs in her sleep, moans, and goes quiet again. She and Donna are new friends; they have not yet learned the intimacies of the other&#039;s mannerisms and habits. Donna&#039;s covers are kicked back and Lee can see Donna&#039;s hand resting between her legs, where dark curls peek from under the crotch of her white panties. Donna&#039;s hand moves, ever so slightly, and she arches her back, just a bit.
Another moan. Lee wonders if the hand has anything to do with the moan. It doesn&#039;t surprise the 23–year–old blond to realize she, and apparently her nipples, like the idea that it does. She had…</p>

        <p class="card-text">The next few days went by rather uneventfully. Neither Carol nor I wanted to make a mistake in our relationship, so we were very, very cautious. In fact, aside from the fact that we continued to sleep in the same bed, our relationship went back to what it had been in the past. I had arrived on Saturday evening and all the big revelations had taken place before midnight Sunday.
While it was uneventful in terms of any wetting together or other sex play, we did get around a bit. We went swimming in Lake Coeur d&#039;Alene, borrowed a friend&#039;s sailboat for a day, spent one whole day shopping and Carol tried to teach me how to play golf – sorry, but that&#039;s just not going to happen! Through it all there was, for me at…</p>

She looked at the monitor to see his flight&#039;s status. To her dismay, she found that it would be forty–five minutes late. She might as well sit somewhere and get a drink. She hesitated, having in mind that she hadn&#039;t peed since she left home about 2 hours ago and would have at least another 3 hours before she could use the bathroom again. Public bathrooms were absolutely out of the question! She had drunk down a bottle of water on her way to the airport…</p>
