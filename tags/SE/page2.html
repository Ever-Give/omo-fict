        <p class="card-text">My partner and I were invited to an Old Skool rave at a friend&#039;s house last weekend. She had not initially understood the invite fully. It was obvious to me but although Val&#039;s English is excellent, it is not her first language and there are subtle cultural differences, which had eluded her. I realised that it was going to be predominantly 90&#039;s music but it was also going to be fancy dress. We were expected to go in school uniform or at least something that would pass as that.
Val was quite surprised. She has never really got her head round this schoolgirl nightclub thing. She feels that there is something odd about young women dressing as provocative schoolgirls, especially as she says the English are so…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Suzy stared out the airplane window, fascinated by the slow transformation of rural landscape into sprawling suburbia. Soon, she would be home from her business trip to the opposite side of the country. Slowly, as her attention shifted back to the inside of the plane, she became aware that she had been jiggling her leg, subconsciously fighting back the urge to go to the bathroom.
To her left was her co–worker Jenna, who had also come along on the trip. Currently, she was asleep, her ample breasts rising and falling slowly in time with her breath. Her sleeping face, hidden slightly beneath her blond hair, was a soft mask of innocence, with a softer, rounder structure than Suzy&#039;s own sharper–edged but still…</p>

She was a girl with long, brown hair, blue eyes, peach skin, and a beautiful, curvy body. As well as a little fetish that she shared with her men.
Lying and squirming on a sturdy mattress, the girl trembled as the spasms of pee pushed her bladder to near bursting point. Keeping her long legs wide open for her partner, she bit down on her lip as the fight to contain her pee became more and more difficult. She had her hands tied down, but she was not planning to use them of her own accord either way. Her legs were not tied, but she chose to spread them for her lover.
Her lover was a muscular man with a rugged face, short,…</p>

        <p class="card-text">My partner and I have written about a few things that we have done. He writes as JanaVal and he also helps me with my English, which allows me to say exactly what I mean when I write.
Although I would consider myself adventurous, wetting myself was not really something that interested me particularly before I met Jana. However, our first episode, which is listed in the stories as &#039;Splash Back&#039;, made me aware of how much Jana enjoyed this.
It is quite good fun I guess, in a rebellious way; and doing it always makes Jana more interested in me. I don&#039;t have a problem playing his games and it is just another, different kind of intimacy we share. I have done it when I have been on my own too, so that I get caught…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Things have taken an unlikely turn at my workplace. I feel very fortunate to have met Tanja, but sometimes wish that it had happened outside the workplace. I doubt I would have been as fortunate with her at a bar or a club. It was something that was destined to happen exactly the way it did. Tanja and I hadn&#039;t even gone out together outside of work or even talked on the phone. I didn&#039;t know anything about her life outside of what I had seen at work. I didn&#039;t know if she had a boyfriend or even girlfriends other than Selena. I wanted to know more about Tanja and considered asking her about her life, but was afraid to come across as interrogating. Tanja was a free–spirited woman, willing to take life by the…</p>

Marge and George were decorating their bedroom. The old wallpaper had been stripped off, the paintwork rubbed down, and they had been to purchase the new paint and paper. When they returned, and pulled onto the driveway, Marge went to unlock the front door while George got the goods out of the car. As he stood up he was surprised to see a young lady in obvious great discomfort approaching him. She only took small steps and yet was hurrying, clutching her abdomen.

My new job has kept me very busy to say the least. I begin work at 9:00 am each morning and quit at 5:00 pm. There is usually a few hours of work left over that I complete at home for clients coming in the next morning. Despite the big workload, I am enjoying my job. A big reason for this is the money. It is nice to be able to eat real meals after living on Kraft Dinner for the past six years. I am even considering moving out of my rented apartment and buying a place within the next year, a big step for someone just a few months out of university.
Without a doubt, the best part of my job is Tanja. I fell in love…</p>

Alan lived opposite a park with a clear view of the bus stop that was outside the entrance. He often used to sit and watch people coming and going through the park, and people waiting for the bus. 
Late one evening he was looking out of his window and he saw a couple of young ladies coming out of the park. They looked to be in their late teens or early twenties, and Alan thought they looked quite attractive. One was brown skinned with black hair, and the other was white skinned with ginger hair.

        <p class="card-text">&quot;Sposa bagnata, sposa fortunata&quot; is a proverb from my native Italy. It means a wet wedding is lucky. Italy enjoys a fairly dry Mediterranean climate and rain is seen as a sign of fertility. I was happy to make my friend&#039;s wedding lucky.
Earlier this year a very good friend of mine, Anya, asked me to be a bridesmaid at her wedding. I was delighted to say yes and very pleased with the dresses she chose. I think this is quite difficult for an English wedding but she has exquisite taste having been in the fashion industry herself. The dress she wanted for me was a faded pink satin, beautifully made and very unfussy. It was very well cut and full enough to benefit from a hooped petticoat underneath.
The dress…</p>

        <p class="card-text">So there I was, my jeans drenched and tears flooding down my face – it was like being submerged under water. It was a well–lit street, and though nobody actually stared, people could easily see that I was standing in a puddle of my own urine. I had never felt so humiliated and so totally isolated in my whole life. Then Paul put his arm round me and said: &quot;Come on, Peach love, let&#039;s get you home.&quot; It was so wonderful to feel that he wasn&#039;t disgusted with me that I just cried all the more. Paul wisely recognised that there was nothing he could say that would make things any better, just shepherded me silently back to his flat.
When we got there, he led me straight into the bathroom. I pulled off all my clothes…</p>

God, it was hot! In fact, it was one of the hottest days I can ever remember, at least in the UK. It was so hot, you didn&#039;t want to do anything; even breathing was an effort. My friend Claire and I were sprawled on a park bench, shaded from the direct sunlight by a large tree. Neither of us had any energy at all – we&#039;d just used up what little we had drinking cold lagers in a nearby pub! 
&#039;Oh, Christ, Jen! This heat really is just too much,&#039; Claire wailed, &#039;I&#039;m absolutely busting for a piss, but I can&#039;t be bothered to move!&#039;
She could almost have been reading my mind. My own bladder was…</p>

We hope you enjoy our contributions, if not for the writing, then just for knowing that what we write is true. Hopefully others will find wetting with a partner is not an empty dream, but with the right encouragement, something intimate and enjoyable for genuinely sharing.
I have a very special relationship with my partner Val, which works very much for both of us. She modelled very successfully for a while, making very good money. She now works in the fashion industry and we have just started our own business. Although she is not turned on by wetting directly, she is happy to play my games and I hers. She will wet…</p>

        <p class="card-text">I am writing about my experiences with a very special woman that I felt very fortunate to meet even if it was for a limited time. It all started with my new job at an advisory and management accounting firm in Los Angeles. I had just graduated from university at the age of 23 and was a little inexperienced in the relationship department. I had never had a girlfriend or even a high school sweetheart. All my sexual experiences had come from binge–drinking campus parties and one–night stands. Admittedly, I was glad to get out of the college life and into the real world, where was I hoping to find a more meaningful relationship that I had not found up to this point.
I had graduated with good grades from a…</p>

Julia and Jessica had been friends since childhood. They had grown up together and were now 20 years old. They had always talked openly together about almost everything, including sexual urges and behaviour. Occasionally they indulged in wetting themselves together, for they both enjoyed feeling their bladders filling up to their capacity and sometimes they went that one bit too far. One Saturday the two were shopping in town. They had drunk several large cokes during the morning and were seated in the…</p>

Pauline and I had been friends since early childhood. We&#039;d grown up together, played together, gone to school together, and done lots of things together. We knew each other pretty well, or so I thought. We both loved cycling and often went for long bike rides in the country, and it was on a summer&#039;s day that we were out cycling together, and had stopped for a drink and a break. Pauline also likes painting. Scenes, portraits, that sort of thing and she&#039;s really good at it. She asked me if I would pose for her, as she wanted to paint me. I&#039;d done so before so I said, &quot;sure, of course I will.&quot;
