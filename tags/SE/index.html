This is a memoir of real events, which took place in the early 1980&#039;s, in the Spring, long after Mardi Gras, probably in May. My partner was &quot;Michelle&quot; (not her real name, of course), my girlfriend of the time, who became a long term friend and lover, over more than 10 years. This trip did a lot to make our relationship closer and more intimate. It happened early in our time together, probably about two years after we originally met. At that time, she was a petite, slender lady, with dark hair, green eyes, very smooth skin, and naturally very sparse pubic hair. She was so &quot;pee shy&quot;, when I met her, that she ran tap water to cover her…</p>

She was a bubbly, outgoing character, very flirtatious and always willing to share a dirty joke or two.We were never more than work colleagues, friends I suppose, but certainly never romantically involved.It was the middle of a typical British summer and the night of the office barbecue.Surprisingly, it wasn&#039;t raining, but the promise of storms to come on the weather forecast didn&#039;t bode well.The barbecue was always held in the large garden of a pub near to the offices, and we basically took the place over for the evening.Plenty of food and plenty of drink was had by all, but eventually it was time to head for home.I had a fairly long…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Sharon&#039;s semester was finally over and she had a couple weeks off before the winter semester started. Kathy had invited her over for an end of semester &quot;surprise&quot; that Saturday. Sharon had no idea what to expect, but was hoping for more pee fun with her professor.
Sharon dressed herself in tight jeans which showed off her perfectly shaped athletic ass and a tight pink t–shirt under a heavy winter coat. Kathy greeted her with a hug and a quick peck on the lips at the door. Sharon was pleased to see her eyes wander over her body as she invited her in. Kathy led her to the kitchen where a large pot of hot chocolate was brewing. Sharon immediately accepted Kathy&#039;s offer of a hot drink and excitedly watched her…</p>

&quot;What can I do for you?&quot; said Danielle to the seemingly happy young couple sitting in front of her. Having been specialised on sex–related cases directly after University about 10 years ago, the therapist wasn&#039;t used to couples holding hands during the first session. &quot;You don&#039;t seem to be too unhappy with each other!&quot;
&quot;Well&quot;, the boy started, &quot;we do love each other, and we have been together for more than five years now. It is just that our sexual fantasies seem not to match.&quot;
&quot;Now, this is the case with the vast majority of all couples&quot; said the therapist &quot;but it is great to see that you intend to…</p>

Damn her, damn her, Sam thought to herself again. Ashley did this every morning. Sam tried to wake up before Ashley but sometimes she timed it wrong.

I was single at the time and hadn&#039;t seen much action for a while and was feeling the frustration a little. I decided I would go out with the girls for a night at a few bars and see what happened, at this point not even thinking about my desperation fascination. We went for a few drinks at a friend?s house before getting the tube into London, and I made sure I peed before we left, more out of small bladder habit than any strong urge to go.
Alcohol for some reason works quicker on my bladder than the rest of me so by the time we got off…</p>

With only the feeble starlight, walking on the docks through the mist made Temperance nervous. Her pace kept accelerating, and soon it became even brisker than she thought possible. Cold was sending shivers down her spine but she knew she could not go faster without jeopardizing the poor balance alcohol induced. She passed by a man throwing up every ounce of liquid he had had in the night and her heart missed a beat when she twisted her ankle because of a slippery paving stone. Her squeaking out of surprise and pain was muffled by the mist but not enough. Four blokes she had not spotted at first were coming towards her with small shining blades in their hands, and dark brown rum in…</p>

When I was 32, a good few years ago now, I was working evenings in a pub, part–time. I was separated and in the process of getting divorced when I met a really nice man. We started seeing each other and after a couple of tease–filled months we had progressed to heavy petting and sex.
On the nights I worked in the pub, I would go round to his bedsit to see him, just for half an hour or so, as we both had day jobs with early starts. We used to mostly just play manually on these occasions, saving the sex for when we had more time together.
Oooh, he was soooo good with his hands, and was very naughty, teasing me in lovely ways until I…</p>

Mandy&#039;s life had changed dramatically in the past 2 months. Her boyfriend, Doug had recently asked her to move in with him and she had happily accepted. Doug&#039;s client base was growing rapidly and the law firm had gotten very busy. With the busier workdays, there had not been as much time for wet fun at work. It had gotten so busy that Doug had to hire a junior lawyer to help him keep up with the workload.

        <p class="card-text">My name is Jenny. I&#039;m a nurse and I was on a bus from Montana to Seattle. I would have driven but had some car problems. In Spokane a cute blond gets on, sits across from me and promptly falls asleep. A few hours later after a rest stop I noticed the blond is still sleeping. In a half–hour she wakes up and we start talking. Her name is Lori and she is very easy to talk to, and we were having a good time until I see her start to squirm. Lori admits she really needs to pee and gets up to ask the driver to stop, then comes back with a very worried look on her face.
We talk some more, but Lori is getting frantic, and starts to bounce in her seat. And I am getting very turned on. Finally she reaches her limit, &quot;Oh…</p>

I work for a large manufacturing company in the UK, and management had decided that we were to have a three–day team training exercise. We were to spend the three team training days at a large hotel in the country, all expenses paid, and most of us were quite excited at the idea. After all, the company was paying and it was a break from the normal daily routine.
Well, the day came and we all boarded the luxurious coaches that had been laid on and after a journey of about an hour and a half, we arrived at the hotel.…</p>

Tanja and I were together in Mexico. It still seemed so surreal even as I lay beside her in bed that first morning in a five star beachside resort. It was already getting quite warm even though it couldn&#039;t have been past 9:30. I considered getting up to turn on the AC before it got too hot, but didn&#039;t want to leave the comfortable bed just yet. Tanja was still sleeping beside me, completely nude. 
It had been a long but fun night. We had gotten drunk back in L.A., but not drunk enough to be restricted from flying. We had taken a cab to the airport, already desperate from the alcohol we had consumed. We…</p>

The first seven weeks of my new job flew by. I was really busy with work, learning many of my tasks on the fly. I was glad that I had paid attention in school; I knew the basics of my job very well. However, there were still many aspects of my job that had been taught lightly or not at all. I worked hard to learn the ropes of the trade and complete my tasks as quickly and effectively as I could. My boss, Mr. Brokovich had been pleased with how well I was picking up things, but it was really all Tanja&#039;s doing. She was a great mentor, both in accounting–related matters and in love.
Before I knew it, it was Friday…</p>

When I was in my late teens, my local park had a boating lake, and Bill, the boatman used to let some of us help him and in return we would get free trips out on the rowing boats. There were several of us– including girl called Tracey, who was about 3 years younger than I. I found her quite attractive and often took the opportunity to share a rowing boat with her. 
One day we rowed into the centre of the lake and drew in the oars, allowing the boat to just drift. We chatted for a while, and soon found ourselves looking into each other&#039;s eyes. We kissed, gently at first but soon quite passionately. Tracey&#039;s hand strayed to my leg, just above…</p>
