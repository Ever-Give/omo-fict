        <p class="card-text">*** Why Is The Bed Wet?
I met this girl named Kate about a year ago. We were both 25 at the time and we have been dating since. Things were going well for us. But recently Kate began having this problem...
&quot;Kate, Why is the bed wet?&quot; I asked as I woke her up from a sleep.
&quot;WHAT?&quot; Kate yelled as she sat right up in bed. &quot;Oh my god! I ... I wet the bed!&quot; Kate was sitting in a large puddle in the bed. The sheets were wet enough that you could see liquid being squeezed out of the fabric as she moved. I woke because I felt the wetness seep over to my side of the bed and found my pajamas wet as well. Kate had a sheer panic look on her face and tears were forming in her eyes.
&quot;Shhh ... Kate it&#039;s ok, accidents…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Kandra put both of her hands onto the rails of the lifeguard chair and lifted her body up into a standing position, her bare feet curled onto the rungs of the chair below. She arched her back to stretch and she tilted her head back, her long straight blond hair flowing straight down, shimmering in the remaining rays of late afternoon sunlight that shone through the large plate glass windows of the indoor pool. She looked like the letter &quot;C,&quot; her athletic body arched as she paused in the position, working the kinks out of her back after sitting for so long. Her red official lifeguard one piece bathing suit fit tightly against her slightly tanned body, her toned abs taut underneath the red fabric, her legs…</p>

        <p class="card-text">&quot;Hanna Evans, come on down!&quot; exclaimed the familiar voice. After more than two years of trying to get tickets, design a costume and the ordeal of auditions, the cute young housewife in the pigtails and the schoolgirl plaid skirt had often thought this moment would never come. Her white blouse and short, very short, skirt really accented her youthful figure. Hanna leapt to her feet and made her way to the stage, her plaid skirt flying, revealing glimpses of white cotton panty as she took steps two at a time. The camera operator, used to all manner of spectacle at the show, was distracted in spite of his experience and drew in close as Hanna&#039;s panties again made an appearance. &quot;Sweet, sweet, sweet!&quot; he spoke…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Kari was a beautiful young girl just out of high school. She had always been incredibly shy, but her smile more than made up for it. After moving away to college she desperately needed a job to pay her bills, but in a college town, jobs can be hard to come by. She wore a tight fitting red blouse, tight khaki pants, and white cotton panties.
After a long day of tedious interviews, Kari was walking back to her dorm when she realized she had far too much to drink on her lunch break. Being new in town she did not know of anywhere she could just stop in to use the rest room, plus she figured, &quot;I&#039;m a grown adult, I&#039;ll be fine.&quot;
Her pace became quicker on the way back to her dorm as she realized she REALLY had to…</p>

Hell, even Jane had no idea what was soon to come. Sitting in Jane&#039;s car, Annie could barely contain her excitement. Jane was always the wild one, doing crazy things for attention. One time she set her lawn on fire, just to get her parents&#039; attention, so she could show them what she had learned in dance class that day. But Annie admired Jane, for she did what Annie could only hope to do, and Jane usually did it for her as well. As they pulled into the mall parking lot, Annie&#039;s stomach starting jumping and fluttering inside of her. Annie had never been to this part of town, although…</p>

&quot;Well, erm, just fine,&quot; I said, a little shocked from her forwardness. &quot;No! More than that,&quot; I continued, &quot;I found it absolutely marvelous. Thank you.&quot;
Josie went on to tell me that their mum &amp; dad had gone away for the weekend and that they had the place all to themselves. &quot;We wondered whether you would like to come over and play rude with us,&quot; she asked.

My wife Ashley and I started going out when we were 16 and have been together ever since. She&#039;s hot, blond with a killer figure. Ashley is the kind of girl everyone likes, she&#039;s sweet, kind and very sexy, and I&#039;m very protective of her. I have seen her desperate to pee about three times in our relationship, and one of them was at school. She knows that it&#039;s my fantasy to see her like this, but she very never does it, so I was surprised the other day.
I woke up at ten on Saturday and looked at my sexy wife. She is shopping obsessed, and has a dozen things to sleep in, but…</p>

We told each other everything, so it was only natural that she told me about how peeing made her come. I told her that I was the exact same way, and within a few months of meeting, we became lovers. We would always go to each other&#039;s houses, or drive somewhere secluded, and act out our most wild fantasies. One day, on the way to a most often deserted field, our most memorable experience occurred. We had started the day by drinking lots of coffee like we always did.

How she longed to do the same. Her clit began to tingle.

Hi, I&#039;m Renee, a 28–year–old chemist with Everett Pharmaceuticals. I first saw Gabriele at the company ladies&#039; softball game. She was medium tall, like me, mid twenties with short red hair, and she was clearly unsure of herself as she stood there while sides were being chosen. But I noticed something else besides her shyness. Her thighs and biceps looked strong...this woman worked out. No one else seemed to notice though, and she was chosen last by the other team.
She did not play until the last two innings. At bat with one out and a runner on first, she swings well and hits the ball hard. But it is right at our second baseman who catches it and then catches the runner off first..…</p>

        <p class="card-text">This morning, I awoke with my hand firmly gripped on my rock hard member. I don&#039;t know what I had been dreaming about or what caused this amazing hard on but it sure felt wonderful. It was particularly nice this morning because I really had to pee badly– very badly. In fact, I couldn&#039;t tell if I was about to cum or pee. In either event I was going to leave my sleepy wife in bed and go get some relief in the bathroom.
In the same second as I was about to throw off the covers and roll out, She turned towards me, flopped her arm down on my stomach and laid her hand across my dick. It seems she was about to wake up too and suddenly realized how big and hard I was. I couldn&#039;t tell her about how much I had to pee…</p>

        <p class="card-text">&quot;Mmmmm,&quot; Annie groaned as the pressure in her belly grew. Secretly though, she enjoyed it. This was what she wanted. She had waited all week for this day, when her parents would be out for the day, about 8 hours. That gave her plenty of time to do what she wanted, and clean it all up too. She would lay in bed at night, softly stroking her young pussy, and think about the day that would come, when she could live out her most wild fantasies. Her friend Jane was on her way...
Jane was into peeing too. Both she and Annie were only 18, but they had known each other since they were 5. They went through the everyday accidents of accidentally peeing in their pants when they were little. If one wet her pants, the…</p>

They were always teasers and knew how to do it, and how far it was safe to go as well. At least I used to think so. On the day that it happened, we were taking a trip to the beach. No, not the main public beach where everyone went, but a small slightly secluded beach, which was usually quiet because there were no shops ice cream vans or candy stalls around. When we arrived, Helena (my daughter) and I had our beach/swim wear on under our clothes so we went straight to the beach but Josie and Charlene, the twins, went to the ladies&#039; to change first.
Helena is an excellent swimmer and she loves swimming, so she went…</p>

He needed to work in the attic and knew it would be best done early, before the Southern California sun turned the attic into an oven. Zane rolled out of bed, dressed and set up his ladder under the attic access door. He worked quickly, tossing all his materials, tools and water jug up into the opening. Ignoring the twinge in his bladder, Zane climbed the ladder and entered the attic. He was glad to see the generous vents at each end of his attic, which would help keep air moving. Zane had just settled in a Los Angeles suburb where he had obtained a good job in information technology. The active and fit 45…</p>

Having spent all my life in the retail business both working with and watching people, I&#039;ve learned how to feed my fetishes by setting up scenarios without the players knowing what&#039;s going on. I know it&#039;s devious but I can&#039;t help myself as they just sort of fall into the act. Sometimes this talent comes in handy when you have some of the fetishes we all seem to enjoy.
