        <p class="card-text">The quiet coolness, the occasional headlights cutting through the darkness, time alone with her thoughts, these were the reasons she loved driving late at night into the early morning hours. It was going to be a long drive but Monet was accustomed to late hours. Earlier that evening she dined at a favorite Chinese restaurant and though she knew she would be driving most of the night she drank tea, but the saltiness of the meal required several glasses of water as well, to quench her thirst. She paid the bill and walked past the restroom, deciding the need was not urgent and could wait until time to refuel. Wanting to get on the road was more pressing and there were always rest areas to stop at along the way.…</p>

Her bladder felt the size of a watermelon and the constant pressure was bringing her to the edge of disgrace. All her training was useless in a situation like this, and she knew she was but seconds away from ruining her entire career.
The evening had started out innocently enough; in fact she had been looking forward to it. She had been commissioned by Gaijin Inc. to provide hospitality to this uncouth Westerner for the evening and had all manner of tricks of the trade planned to excite his foreign…</p>

Xander had become a bit paranoid over all the vampires and other monsters he knew existed since a few months. Yes, the friendship with Muffy and Willow and Cordelia was doing him both good and bad. Good since he wasn&#039;t such a geek anymore, bad because he found it difficult to adapt to the new world around him. He was constantly on the move, making hideout after hideout, believing monsters couldn&#039;t track him. But now he was under some sort of spell apparently.

        <p class="card-text">When Katie awoke some time later, finding that she smelling strongly of dried pee, she remembered that she had to get the mink panties cleaned. She picked up the phone and rang the express collect delivery service, finding that an item could be cleaned and returned within an hour. Retrieving the panties from the radiator, she found that though they were dry they had a strong pungent odor, so to avoid embarrassment she added some strong perfume. Then sealing them in a bag, it would not completely mask the sexy smell but it might stop the cleaners from thinking too much.
The courier called later for the dirty panties, promising to return them in an hour and a half, leaving Katie time to shower, wash her hair…</p>

They knew that neither of them would be able to drive, so Jane and Lori had left their car at Jane&#039;s cousin&#039;s house where they were staying. They had been drinking for about 4 hours– and just recently had a couple of pitchers of beer. They knew that the last bus ran at 2:15am and they would have to make it or have no way home, as a person could never get a taxi at that time of night. The guys were also taking the bus, but in the opposite direction, and said that their last bus would run 1:55am. It was getting close to that…</p>

I told them that I was prepared to be a sort of referee; however there were to be some ground rules. I wanted to be a witness to all challenges, or else I couldn&#039;t be fair. Secondly I wanted to stay friends with all of them so I said that I was going to be fair, and that they shouldn&#039;t get mad at me for making judgments. Thirdly– I wanted someone to be the most daring in at least 3 things, so it wouldn&#039;t be chance. Fourth– I knew two of them had a phobia and I didn&#039;t…</p>

Back in the early 1980&#039;s I became involved with a sexy blonde girl named Mindy who was a former stripper. At the time we were both in our mid 20&#039;s. She was a big girl, not fat by any means but what most would call statuesque. About 150 lbs, 5&#039; 11&quot;, large pendulous tits, a nice round ass, and legs a mile long which she loved to show off with short mini–skirts. She turned heads wherever we went, both male and female.
The sex was hot from the start, and within a few months we were living together. She was quite open–minded sexually and we experimented with just about everything including pee fun. While this did not turn her…</p>

        <p class="card-text">After the phone sex I had with Amanda, my college lecturer, we had both promised to refrain from any sexual indulgence until our arranged meeting the following afternoon. By that time we would both be feeling very horny, and we had also decided to resist relieving our bladders from lunch onwards. I was more than happy to agree, &quot;but don&#039;t forget,&quot; I had reminded her. &quot;You have us for P E at the last session – you don&#039;t want me to wet myself during that?&quot; &quot;No,&quot; she said, &quot;but it will be nicer if we are both having to hold on, so be a good girl until then, good bye.&quot; The phone went dead, leaving me sitting on the toilet tingling with anticipation, my hand still in my wet panties, it was all I could do to keep my…</p>

While my mom had really tried to get me dry, and eventually forbade me to use diapers, I had hardly moved to my first own apartment when I ran out to purchase large amounts of diapers and everything that was needed besides them. Since the day had been exhausting, I had gone to bed early and happily in diapers. My subconscious seemed to have grasped the fact, for that night I wasn&#039;t plagued by bad dreams of searching desperately for a toilet, while the pressure in my bladder grew worse and worse – but I guess you know this type of nightmares. No, I slept like a log…</p>

Both families having cabins by the small lake, we just had to be together. There were more young people around that we met, became friends, drifted apart. But Kate was something special. And that summer something changed. It was the annual midsummer feast, everybody gathering in the clearing by the bay, barbecuing, playing games, children dipping their toes. My family had arrived that afternoon, my little sister seeking her best friend, and I hoped Kate was there. She was.

She was dressed in a short skirt and tight top, had dark, curly hair, and was not very tall. Her clothes accentuated her rounded body, and her skirt rode up to reveal the top of her stay–up pantyhose. A woman in her thirties on the lookout.I was sitting by the bar, ready to be selected. I lifted my glass and nodded to her. The music was loud. She put her hands to her red mouth and mouthed, &quot;dance?&quot; and I finished my beer and rose. She came into my arms, almost sliding into place, and I felt soft breasts brush my stomach and a deliberate pressure against my groin. My…</p>
