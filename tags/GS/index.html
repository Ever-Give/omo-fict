        <p class="card-text">This story contains Female Desperation, Humiliation, Female Wetting, Female Peeing, and Golden Showers. When I got home, no one was around, so I quietly went to my room, changed clothes and went straight to bed. There was so much to dream about: wet panties, soaked pussies, and overwhelming ladies! Two weeks passed and nothing had happened. The weather was rather rainy and I had chosen to ride my bike or hitch a ride whenever some neighbor&#039;s kid had the same hours as I did. But summer came back and so did my desire to pick up my clothes. Doubtless, Mom would ask for them now that the weather allowed wearing them again. And maybe there was something else that attracted me to that house with a birch tree in…</p>

        <p class="card-text">This story contains Female Desperation, Deliberate Wetting, Humiliation, Golden Showers, and Domination. My parents didn&#039;t think I should be given a car, so usually I preferred riding my bike to school. But since that memorable day, I chose to walk home more often, benefitting from the fact that I could get a lift in the morning by a neighbor working close to my school. I knew my parents didn&#039;t expect me home at a specific time &#039; after all I was old enough to care for myself &#039; and I kept wandering along quiet roads, immersed in memories of &quot;Lady Birch&quot;: In my dreams I had needed a name for her, so I christened her after the tree standing in her front yard.At the same time, Lady Birch had started to feel qualms…</p>

The guitarist and lead singer of the band she had worshipped practically all her life! In her wildest dreams of becoming a rock star, she had never anticipated THIS. A 5&#039;1&quot;–110 pound, black–haired eighteen year old who had just graduated high school last week was going on tour with her favourite band, TrashFlinger! She HAD to be dreaming. Nissa pinched herself to make sure she was awake before dialling up her band mates to reveal the news. Since Grade 8, Nissa and her best friends had been fans of TrashFlinger, a local punk rock band that had been kicking around for almost ten years now.…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Two weeks had passed since the eventful sleepover at Jamie&#039;s house. Both girls had grown to need the others touch. This had led to some incredibly risky lovemaking outside their homes– at the movies, in the quiet corners of the public library, even the bathroom stalls at school. The risk of getting discovered turned them on immensely and they had barely escaped some close calls. Jamie received a phone call from Misty the day after the wetting incident at the bar. Being the experimental type and a closet wetter for many years, Misty was dying for more fun with Jamie and Kiran. However, getting to Mistys apartment during her free hours was a difficult task for the two schoolgirls living under the close…</p>

I work for a large manufacturing company in the UK, and management had decided that we were to have a three–day team training exercise. We were to spend the three team training days at a large hotel in the country, all expenses paid, and most of us were quite excited at the idea. After all, the company was paying and it was a break from the normal daily routine.
Well, the day came and we all boarded the luxurious coaches that had been laid on and after a journey of about an hour and a half, we arrived at the hotel.…</p>

When I was in my late teens, my local park had a boating lake, and Bill, the boatman used to let some of us help him and in return we would get free trips out on the rowing boats. There were several of us– including girl called Tracey, who was about 3 years younger than I. I found her quite attractive and often took the opportunity to share a rowing boat with her. 
One day we rowed into the centre of the lake and drew in the oars, allowing the boat to just drift. We chatted for a while, and soon found ourselves looking into each other&#039;s eyes. We kissed, gently at first but soon quite passionately. Tracey&#039;s hand strayed to my leg, just above…</p>

She was a girl with long, brown hair, blue eyes, peach skin, and a beautiful, curvy body. As well as a little fetish that she shared with her men.
Lying and squirming on a sturdy mattress, the girl trembled as the spasms of pee pushed her bladder to near bursting point. Keeping her long legs wide open for her partner, she bit down on her lip as the fight to contain her pee became more and more difficult. She had her hands tied down, but she was not planning to use them of her own accord either way. Her legs were not tied, but she chose to spread them for her lover.
Her lover was a muscular man with a rugged face, short,…</p>

With her long, shiny hair, her slender and athletic but well–rounded figure, and her –as usual – fashionable style of dress she was the siren boys might die for. She was living in the next village and not especially fond of Marianne, although she knew the girl liked her. At present, she was disappointed to see the group of women here, where she had thought to take a quick pee break in the bunker. She knew about the vagabond living there and as she did not like vagabonds she wanted to annoy him by peeing into his treasured home. She was relieved to see the three women were almost asleep and as it seemed, naked.…</p>

Laura was sitting in the folding chair, filming Gillian as she was holding Marianne and felt her body quiver with lust and expectation, but also with the urgent need to pee. They had been hiking almost two hours now, and the nice pee break behind the picturesque chapel had been before they started. Laura felt the three litres of water she had drunk in the meantime filling her bladder to full capacity. She was on the verge of letting go; she wanted to pee right in the chair she sat in. Thinking about this she realized Marianne could look right up her crotch since she wasn&#039;t…</p>

        <p class="card-text">It had been ages since I had visited my aunt in the Midlands and since I was in the area on a business trip I decided to drop in. Aunt May was always happy to put up anyone who dropped in, whether they were expected or not, so I decided to surprise her and turn up unannounced. I arrived about 7pm on Friday evening, knocked the door, walked in and shouted &quot;Hi!&quot;
I was a little surprised when a young female voice shouted back, &quot;Who&#039;s that?&quot; I walked into the lounge and saw that Jenny and Jilly were sitting on the sofa with no sign of Aunt May. Jenny and Jilly were identical twins that lived across the road from Aunt May. They were about 23 years old and were absolutely gorgeous. &quot;Oh, Hi Gord,&quot; said Jilly, &quot;Your…</p>

        <p class="card-text">About a week ago, my girlfriend Jenny and I decided to go to a small–town outdoor country music festival. The way it was advertised was that music would be going all day and well into the night, with vendors selling food, arts &amp; crafts, and the like. Jenny and I are both into country music, and are kind of the outdoorsy types.
I fell in love with this girl a couple years ago when we were seniors in high school. We had flirted around for a couple of months when a mutual friend finally hooked us up. I couldn&#039;t believe my luck that this slender, athletic blonde country girl wanted to hook up with me.
It only took us a few months to get intimate– at our senior prom, no less, and we soon found out how sexually…</p>

        <p class="card-text">It was a cool autumn day when 25 year old Melissa stood on her friend&#039;s doorstep, her long black hair blowing across her sexy eyes in the brisk breeze. Mel is the type of girl that has &quot;the eyes.&quot; &quot;The eyes&quot; are the type of eyes that can give a super sexy look and get anyone to do anything. She fidgeted with her panties for a moment as they were riding into her crotch cause she liked to wear tight satin panties. These ones were blue with flower prints on them under her baby pink mini skirt. She made sure her tits looked nice and perky in her matching pink halter–top and knocked on the door. After she knocked on the door she realized pulling her panties out of her pussy made her horny and she shifted her legs.…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Lisa woke up nervous today, because today wasn&#039;t just another day. First of all, let me tell you about Lisa. She&#039;s very pretty, long tanned legs, tight ass, 36C cup, and sexy brunette hair to match her cute brown eyes. She&#039;s also very bisexual; she may even prefer girls to guys. And for the past few months she&#039;s been toying over the Internet, getting interested in the idea of being dominant and having a submissive girl. And today was the day she was going to meet the girl she had been talking with for those few months. From the pictures she saw, Christy is a feisty redhead girl with shoulder length curly hair who is athletic and has perky tits.
Lisa stretched and enjoyed the sun sparkling over her nude body…</p>

        <p class="card-text">A while ago – actually quite a while – I met a girl on the Internet. Casually, we exchanged some thoughts and experiences concerning watersports. After a while, we were already deeply into the subject and had dropped in passing some information about the people we had met on our way. In one of my mails I had answered her question whether I knew people in Europe who were into watersports, too, in writing her that I had made very few such acquaintances. Actually, all I remembered was a summer I had passed in France working on a farm, a while ago. It was a small hamlet with just a farm, two houses and a small chapel in a picturesque landscape of small mountains and green valleys. Nice place to be on holidays,…</p>

She looked at the monitor to see his flight&#039;s status. To her dismay, she found that it would be forty–five minutes late. She might as well sit somewhere and get a drink. She hesitated, having in mind that she hadn&#039;t peed since she left home about 2 hours ago and would have at least another 3 hours before she could use the bathroom again. Public bathrooms were absolutely out of the question! She had drunk down a bottle of water on her way to the airport…</p>
