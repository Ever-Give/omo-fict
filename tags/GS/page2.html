        <p class="card-text">Jane lived up to her name. She&#039;d always been a plain girl and somewhat unattractive, I thought. She&#039;d been a classmate of my daughter when she was in school but after they left they sort of lost touch with each other. That was nearly ten years ago.
A couple of weeks ago, who turns up on my doorstep but Jane? She still looked quite plain. Not the sort of girl that would cause me to turn my head. Anyhow, out of politeness I asked her in and offered her a cup of tea, which she gratefully accepted. I couldn&#039;t help but notice that Jane was a bit fidgety as we caught up with things that had happened to each of us since we last saw each other, and she also asked after my daughters, so I gave her their phone numbers.…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Godfrey was sat on the train, reading his newspaper on his way home from a business trip. It was a two–carriage train and it was beginning to fill up, but the seat next to him was still empty, which pleased him. At the next station, however, several more passengers got on, including a very pretty blonde girl in her early twenties, who came and sat next to him. Godfrey shuffled up a bit to make room for the young lady. As the train pulled out of the station the young lady looked round and upon seeing that everyone was seated, she got up and went toward the toilet. She returned almost immediately and sat down looking a little irritated and uncomfortable. &quot;Typical of this damned rail company,&quot; she complained to…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Returning home at five thirty, Anne stripped off, throwing her blouse, damp skirt, and sodden knickers into the laundry basket. Lighting a couple of scented candles she ran herself a warm, soothing bath with plenty of foamy bubble bath in it. After the day she&#039;d had, she definitely needed to pamper herself a little. She wasn&#039;t bitter or angry about what had happened – neither did she feel any self–reproach. Since the events of lunchtime she&#039;d had plenty of opportunity to pause and reflect. The painful, unpleasant, and humiliating experience of tumbling on the office stairs and wetting herself in front of Clive had actually helped her to clarify and resolve matters of which she&#039;d been aware for some weeks but…</p>

        <p class="card-text">When we last left off with our lovers, they were on their way to the mall. But Annie had no idea what Jane had in store for them. Hell, even Jane had no idea what was soon to come. Sitting in Jane&#039;s car, Annie could barely contain her excitement. Jane was always the wild one, doing crazy things for attention. One time she set her lawn on fire, just to get her parents&#039; attention, so she could show them what she had learned in dance class that day. But Annie admired Jane, for she did what Annie could only hope to do, and Jane usually did it for her as well. As they pulled into the mall parking lot, Annie&#039;s stomach starting jumping and fluttering inside of her. Annie had never been to this part of town, although…</p>

        <p class="card-text">A couple of days after the beach showers happening, I was in my study when the phone rang. &quot;Hello&quot; I said and a voice the other end replied in soft seductive tones &quot;Hi big daddy. How are you today then?&quot; It was Josie. &quot;Charlene and I were wondering how you enjoyed our little adventure on the beach the other day?&quot; she continued.
&quot;Well, erm, just fine,&quot; I said, a little shocked from her forwardness. &quot;No! More than that,&quot; I continued, &quot;I found it absolutely marvelous. Thank you.&quot;
Josie went on to tell me that their mum &amp; dad had gone away for the weekend and that they had the place all to themselves. &quot;We wondered whether you would like to come over and play rude with us,&quot; she asked.
&quot;Yeah, please do if you…</p>

They were always teasers and knew how to do it, and how far it was safe to go as well. At least I used to think so. On the day that it happened, we were taking a trip to the beach. No, not the main public beach where everyone went, but a small slightly secluded beach, which was usually quiet because there were no shops ice cream vans or candy stalls around. When we arrived, Helena (my daughter) and I had our beach/swim wear on under our clothes so we went straight to the beach but Josie and Charlene, the twins, went to the ladies&#039; to change first.
Helena is an excellent swimmer and she loves swimming, so she went…</p>
