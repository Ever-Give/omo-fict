Note: This story contains Female Desperation &amp; Wetting, Bed Wetting, and &amp; Masturbation. Work has been hell recently. I have really been under pressure to complete a major project to get some complex documentation complete and the whole thing has been dogged by problems. As a result I have had sleepless nights and have felt really stressed out, the eventual result of which proved rather embarassing. At the end of a particularly bad week my friends persuaded me to go out for a drink on Friday night. I arrived home more relaxed and rather drunk, though not excessively so, took a quick shower and tumbled into bed. Around 6.30, half asleep and confused, I realized something was…</p>

        <p class="card-text">After my accident the first night of school, I realized I needed to put a waterproof sheet on my bed. Even though I didn&#039;t think I would need it again, the pee stain I had left was huge, and I couldn&#039;t get it out. So after my first day of classes, I went to a local store and found an absorbent mattress cover. It was actually better than the plastic sheets I had thought I needed, because it wouldn&#039;t crinkle.
Fortunately, Sarah wasn&#039;t in our room when I got back, and I was able to put my protective cover on my bed and remake it before she got back. It was a close call though– she came in about five minutes after I was done and asked if I wanted to go get dinner.
The next few days passed without incident. I was…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Claire wanted to get to bed early that night because tomorrow was her first day working as in intern for WXTC, a local television station. And after four years of college she wanted nothing more to work as a T.V reporter, and this was finally her chance to get into the business. She thought she had an edge up over some of the hundreds of other girls that always wanted the job because of her looks. She was really striking; 5&#039;6, 125 lbs, very full, slightly curly light brown that flowed past her shoulders, slightly pale but it suited her. And a body to match with a very cute full butt, but still very firm and trim and perky B cup breasts. So, Claire got ready for bed by putting on a soft light blue tight t–shirt…</p>

        <p class="card-text">When I was 18 and a senior in high school, our soccer team went to the state finals. We were playing in the semi–final game Saturday, and if we won, were playing in the state finals on Sunday. We headed up to Denver after school on Friday, because our coach didn&#039;t want us to play after a 2–hour bus ride. Unfortunately, the school was only planning to pay for Saturday night and all the girls had to share beds because we could only get half the rooms. I was rooming with three other senior girls. Kelly was a starter, like me, while Alyssa and Kira were backups. Though this was not a big deal, Alyssa played the same position as me and made it clear she thought she should be the starter.
Anyways, we got up to the…</p>

        <p class="card-text">It was a cold, wintry day, when Sarah woke up. It was still dark outside and the wind was blowing hard against the window. She immediately noticed her very bad need to pee. She was almost bursting. The need was so bad that she was actually frightened to move. She felt that any tiny movement might make her loose bladder control immediately.
She was laying there, in her nice, warm bed, with her comfy terrycloth pyjamas on, her heart hammering against her chest. &quot;I need to get up,&quot; she thought. &quot;I need to go to the bathroom, quickly!&quot; &quot;I can&#039;t move. I just can&#039;t, or I will pee the bed&quot; was the immediate afterthought.
Trembling, she was lying there, trying to make up the courage to try it. To make herself hold…</p>

Tanja and I were together in Mexico. It still seemed so surreal even as I lay beside her in bed that first morning in a five star beachside resort. It was already getting quite warm even though it couldn&#039;t have been past 9:30. I considered getting up to turn on the AC before it got too hot, but didn&#039;t want to leave the comfortable bed just yet. Tanja was still sleeping beside me, completely nude. 
It had been a long but fun night. We had gotten drunk back in L.A., but not drunk enough to be restricted from flying. We had taken a cab to the airport, already desperate from the alcohol we had consumed. We…</p>

By age 18 I was living mostly in a house in London run by chaperones who made sure that we were looked after and always ready to run off to shows and shoots. It was here that I had an unusual experience.

And it didn&#039;t help that the scanner wouldn&#039;t read one of the items, and so the checkout girl had to call the supervisor to sort it out. It was all adding to the time spent waiting, time Samantha was rapidly realising she didn&#039;t have. As she paid and loaded the last of the bags into her trolley she felt a small dribble of pee escape into her knickers. She thought to herself how lucky it was she was wearing a skirt and not jeans.

        <p class="card-text">Sharon handed her ticket to the uniformed steward who was standing on the platform beside the open door to carriage E of the Inverness Sleeper. He studied it for a moment or two and made a tick on a piece of paper on his clip board, then handed the ticket back to Sharon.
&quot;Turn right,&quot; he said in an indifferent, couldn&#039;t–care–less tone of voice. &quot;Third compartment. Your room mate&#039;s already aboard.&quot;
Sharon wasn&#039;t altogether happy with the idea of sharing a sleeping compartment with a total stranger, but that was the deal if you could only afford a standard class fare. First class passengers got a sleeping compartment to themselves; but first class fares were way beyond Sharon&#039;s means. So she hefted her…</p>

        <p class="card-text">I&#039;d like to tell you about some of the strange things that happened to me after I went to college. I went to a different state, with two of my best friends, and our parents bought a house for us to live in. They did it on a few conditions. We had to maintain the building (they would pay back the bills, but we had to arrange the repairs and if we could do them ourselves. We had to progress in college, so no partying all night, each night. We had to come back home on a regular basis and finally we had to take care of the bills. We didn&#039;t have to pay rent, but they didn&#039;t give us any money to live off of (they did pay college tuition and our books and stuff). We thought it to be a good deal and we took it. We had…</p>

        <p class="card-text">*** Why Is The Bed Wet?
I met this girl named Kate about a year ago. We were both 25 at the time and we have been dating since. Things were going well for us. But recently Kate began having this problem...
&quot;Kate, Why is the bed wet?&quot; I asked as I woke her up from a sleep.
&quot;WHAT?&quot; Kate yelled as she sat right up in bed. &quot;Oh my god! I ... I wet the bed!&quot; Kate was sitting in a large puddle in the bed. The sheets were wet enough that you could see liquid being squeezed out of the fabric as she moved. I woke because I felt the wetness seep over to my side of the bed and found my pajamas wet as well. Kate had a sheer panic look on her face and tears were forming in her eyes.
&quot;Shhh ... Kate it&#039;s ok, accidents…</p>

I did something new last night. I&#039;ve been reading the stories on this site for about a year and enjoying them and some of the pictures. What I&#039;ve most enjoyed is the knowledge that there are other people out there who enjoy the same sort of thing that I do. I thank you all for being there and helping me enjoy being the person who I am. But about last night...
I enjoy wetting myself. If you&#039;ve been reading my stories from last summer that should be pretty obvious. I&#039;ve been wetting my panties for several years and discovered the thrill of actually wetting my pants last summer. I can hardly get enough of that feeling when I first start to let it go, when I can&#039;t quite tell if I&#039;m getting wet or…</p>
