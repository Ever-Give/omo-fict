&quot;What can I do for you?&quot; said Danielle to the seemingly happy young couple sitting in front of her. Having been specialised on sex–related cases directly after University about 10 years ago, the therapist wasn&#039;t used to couples holding hands during the first session. &quot;You don&#039;t seem to be too unhappy with each other!&quot;
&quot;Well&quot;, the boy started, &quot;we do love each other, and we have been together for more than five years now. It is just that our sexual fantasies seem not to match.&quot;
&quot;Now, this is the case with the vast majority of all couples&quot; said the therapist &quot;but it is great to see that you intend to…</p>

        <p class="card-text">After a studious semester my first year in college, I realized that the classes were easy. Not really all that different from high school. I had been expecting something challenging and unexpected to leap out at any point that first semester, but it never did. I relaxed a lot about my schoolwork then. I still did well, but allowed myself to have a social life as well.
I still wasn&#039;t a big house–party person. Those things are just annoying to me. A bunch of my friends were having a dorm party though, with one of those giant jugs of vodka and a couple of gallons of Tampico. I was pumped.
We all started drinking and playing Strip Monopoly, the rules of which still confuse me. I was wearing my college freshman…</p>

Alan lived opposite a park with a clear view of the bus stop that was outside the entrance. He often used to sit and watch people coming and going through the park, and people waiting for the bus. 
Late one evening he was looking out of his window and he saw a couple of young ladies coming out of the park. They looked to be in their late teens or early twenties, and Alan thought they looked quite attractive. One was brown skinned with black hair, and the other was white skinned with ginger hair.

        <p class="card-text">So there I was, my jeans drenched and tears flooding down my face – it was like being submerged under water. It was a well–lit street, and though nobody actually stared, people could easily see that I was standing in a puddle of my own urine. I had never felt so humiliated and so totally isolated in my whole life. Then Paul put his arm round me and said: &quot;Come on, Peach love, let&#039;s get you home.&quot; It was so wonderful to feel that he wasn&#039;t disgusted with me that I just cried all the more. Paul wisely recognised that there was nothing he could say that would make things any better, just shepherded me silently back to his flat.
When we got there, he led me straight into the bathroom. I pulled off all my clothes…</p>

Alisha was a university graduate in her twenties. She was raised in a conservative family but had always wanted to explore her secret hidden desires. She was sweet looking on the outside with her curly light brown hair and her cute little smile. She also was a bit sexy looking, her chest a little bit above average and with a nice bottom. Though she was a little bit shy sometimes, she was the…</p>

God, it was hot! In fact, it was one of the hottest days I can ever remember, at least in the UK. It was so hot, you didn&#039;t want to do anything; even breathing was an effort. My friend Claire and I were sprawled on a park bench, shaded from the direct sunlight by a large tree. Neither of us had any energy at all – we&#039;d just used up what little we had drinking cold lagers in a nearby pub! 
&#039;Oh, Christ, Jen! This heat really is just too much,&#039; Claire wailed, &#039;I&#039;m absolutely busting for a piss, but I can&#039;t be bothered to move!&#039;

The pee gang was a group of three senior girls – Rachel, Melissa, and Randy. They were famous for the wetting stunts they frequently pulled. Probably their favourite trick was to use a two code–word system. Most people had no idea how they did it, but then again most people didn&#039;t try to be around every time the pee gang put on one of their shows. They&#039;d stage a casual conversation, use one code–word to indicate when they were ready, which would then be repeated by all the other members of the group to indicate that they, too, were ready, and another…</p>

Natalie had long dark auburn hair and was a slightly plump but pretty girl in her late teens who had a crush on me, despite the fact that I am about 20 years or so her senior. I often visited her parents at their home and Natalie would almost always sit next to me on the sofa. On a couple of occasions she had shown me something of her body, and strangely her parents hadn&#039;t objected. The first occasion was when her mum came in with some new clothes for her. She immediately took them out of the bags and held up a blouse and a bra. Without further ado she stood up, facing me, and removed her top and bra, her ample 38DD breasts bouncing…</p>

Over the years, the wife and I have had a lot of wetting experiences with other parties and privately. We never wrote about these, choosing to be anonymous at her request. She&#039;s passed away now, and I&#039;m too old to be intimidated anymore so here it comes.
First of all, we determined there were TWO kinds of pee. Ordinarily the kidneys filter blood and send the waste to the bladder. This contains, among other things, acetic acid also known as vinegar, and this gives it the yellow tint you see. We called this DIRTY PEE. However, if you drink a lot of liquid in a relatively short time (guzzling NOT recommended…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Elizabeth is taking a walk through the forest with her sisters. They&#039;re on holidays and decided to go out to enjoy the wild. Suddenly Michelle stops, and Alyssa and Elizabeth turn around to see what&#039;s going on.
Michelle: &quot;Wait a minute girls, I have to pee, can&#039;t hold it anymore.&quot;
Elizabeth guesses that her sister is going to go behind the bushes, or even pull down her jeans and panties to squat right there, but gets surprised seeing Michelle just standing still and closing her eyes. From where she stands she can&#039;t see anything unusual, but now she&#039;s looking at her from behind and sees two lines of wetness starting to form down her sister&#039;s legs as a wet stain grows in her ass.
Elizabeth: &quot;MICHELLE! You&#039;re…</p>

Jenny could still hear Jerry banging around in the toilet behind the hut as she finished chapter 2 of her book. It was approaching 11 am and the sun was now high in the sky. With nary a cloud in sight, Jenny had taken the opportunity to move her stool outside in front of the hut to catch some of the rays. Little beads of perspiration formed on her flat, bronze tummy as she took in the heat and she wondered if her mother had taken the day off work since it was so beautiful outside. Jenny&#039;s mother, Sandie was also a looker. Only 37, she had Jenny when she was 18. Sandie never got the chance to go to college and raised Jenny…</p>

&quot;Yeah it is,&quot; her friend Mandy replied. Summer&#039;s brain stopped for a second before she realized that she was thinking out loud.
&quot;So what are we going to do?&quot; Summer asked, her long blonde hair falling almost seductively over her face, sweat dripping from her shoulders down under her tank top, making her 36 Cs glisten under the hot sun. The only thing on her that wasn&#039;t sweaty was her toned, tan legs, which looked especially sexy in her short pink &amp; white striped satin basketball shorts. For being 25 she definitely looked like she could still be in high school and yet would get any guy&#039;s testosterone…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Hi, my name is Anni van Beek, and I found this site quite by accident. I live in Seattle, but I am of Dutch origin, and I have moved here with my parents when I was 9. (That is why neither my Dutch nor my English is close to perfect...)
I would like to tell you how I got into what others would call &quot;strange habits,&quot; and actually, I can tell stories that would fill a book.
It all started when I met Carlene. We work in the same insurance company, two cubicles apart. We often had lunch break together (we still have) and became fairly open to each other.
Back to Carlene– she looks like what the boys would call cute, seeming a bit naive sometimes.
She had told me once that her parents had always been very…</p>
