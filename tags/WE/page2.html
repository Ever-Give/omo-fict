        <p class="card-text">Each wet weekend May and I have three sessions. Friday there is the need to hydrate and that means establishing a level playing field. What with drinking tea and coffee as well as alcohol we often start off in a dehydrated condition so we play &#039;hold it&#039; to start with. If we meet in a public place its off to the pub and take in a pint or two of shandy followed by fresh orange. The task is then to reach the boat without losing any.
After eating, the next round is usually messy involving May finding interesting and unexpected ways to force me to put my clothing in the washing basket. Anticipating when she will do this has become one of my major tasks since she is cunning. Once she held until after the meal then…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Here&#039;s another letter from Robert and I but we&#039;ve tried to stick to what happened around the time of the &#039;floods&#039; at the end of 2000.
Robert&#039;s boat has been out of action for a while so we had our wet weekend at his house and you&#039;d be surprised how close it is to yours.
As usual I arrived at the station full to overflowing. Now I&#039;m not very good at geography and when Robert said to take the train to Dewsbury I thought it must be the station nearest to his house so it was a bit of a surprise when he said we had to go another half an hour by car.
He had borrowed a neighbor&#039;s car and so we had to keep it dry. I&#039;m all right in a train but the jiggling of a car plays havoc with my lower parts. I shuffled about…</p>

While cruising around the canals of England I stopped for the night in rural Warwickshire and wandered back along the towpath for a mile or so to an eighteenth century pub for a pint or two. On the way back the urge to pee arrived which is never a problem either in the country or on a boat, there&#039;s hardly ever anyone around. Being a half decent sort of chap I hopped over a gate into a field of sheep and had just opened up when a voice shouted, &quot;There he is.&quot; I closed…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Here is the other half of the Tea in Bed weekend as I persuaded May to write it. There are fewer characters because she sticks closer to the facts, Robert.
I wish Robert had let me type this because I&#039;d have done it better.
To explain about me first: I was always the fat girl at school, the one nobody wanted on their team. I grew up on a new housing estate in a town in Cheshire and I really only had one friend, that was Rachel who was tall&amp; thin. The girls said &quot;Here comes 10&quot; because she looked like a 1 and I was short and round. She used to come by my house almost every day till we were 16 then she left school and got a job. I stayed on and was very lonely.
After A levels I found a job as the office…</p>

        <p class="card-text">I have had this girlfriend for almost two years now but it has been just phone sex and hours of Internet foreplay. But... not long ago, we had the pleasure of a wild afternoon interlude and unbelievable watersport fun. This is a true story but it could be dangerous, so I wouldn&#039;t recommend it to everyone.
Twenty–five years ago, we lived in the same town and we were lovers and roommates at the time but it just wasn&#039;t right for a long–term relationship. We broke up and I never heard from her again. She was really wonderful; it was I who was the jerk.
Almost two years ago though, I found her on line as I was surfing some Internet site–– I couldn&#039;t believe it. We spent nearly a year getting caught up on the…</p>

The mere sight of him stirs a longing into her being. Her head drops to her chest and the fragrance of his cologne on his shirt that she wears assaults her nostrils. Her eyes close and the image of him unfurls, causing her to steady herself with her arms outstretched on the counter. The thoughts of him are so clear that she never hears him re–enter the kitchen.
Silently, he stands against the door jam with his coat slung over his shoulder admiring her as she stood slightly leaned forward across the granite…</p>

One of the things we did on the 4th floor &quot;ZOO&quot; was to adopt the 2nd floor girls as our sister floor.

        <p class="card-text">Ashley wasn&#039;t the most popular girl, or the best looking. However, Kevin didn&#039;t care. He liked her for her personality. 
On the day school was out, Ashley was very busy, She would go to school, do everything there, then she would come home and immediately go to the orthodontist. Then it was off to physical therapy, because she broke her arm a while back. Then she was going to Kevin&#039;s for dinner, and then off to the movies. 
At the end of the school day, her bladder was already feeling it. Through the orthodontist appt., she was squirming the whole time. By the time it was dinner, she couldn&#039;t imagine making it till about 10:30, the end of the movie.
The two went to the theater, and Ashley had the hottest…</p>

        <p class="card-text">I started studying with Miss Anderson at fourteen. I had played for as long as I can remember, and was ready to go on to more difficult pieces – thence the private lessons. Miss Anderson was around thirty and usually dressed in proper skirt and blouse, with her auburn hair tied into a bun. Still, she was the object of my fantasies, being a woman who took me seriously, as opposed to the girls of my own age, who were either plain and giggly or pretty and condescending. She was petite, about my height at that time, and the decent clothes did not hide her womanly shape. I kept my dreams a secret for four years. After returning that autumn from three months&#039; break, I found myself a couple of inches taller, with…</p>

        <p class="card-text">She bumped into me at the bar. Five–five, blonde hair in two short pigtails, cheeky smile, and dressed in black low–cut pants and top showing three inches of bare belly. She said hi and smiled expectantly at me. Who am I to turn someone down? –Like a drink, I said. She nodded, pigtails waving. –Beer is fine. While waiting we introduced ourselves. Her name was Carrie. I resisted suggesting carrying her home, as she seemed to have gotten the same idea. The crowd was pushing, and she swayed on her feet, pushing a breast against my arm or a hip against my thigh. I admit to feeling something rise down there. –You here alone, she asked, very close to my ear. –Not really. –Oh. Well, I don&#039;t have company. She brushed…</p>

        <p class="card-text">A few weeks after I had peed my jeans in the rain with my sister I was in the park with a good friend of mine, Jo–Anne. We were goofing around and having fun in the nice weather when Jo–Anne suddenly told me we had to find a toilet. She had had to pee for a while, as did I, and a bit escaped. We went to where the toilets were in the park, or rather, usually were. The city had apparently had had enough of the vandalism, and the toilets had been removed. Jo–Anne doubled over in pain and told me she&#039;d never make it home. She barely got here and she was about to pee her jeans. I felt sorry for her and told her she would be able to make it if she just tried. With a tear falling down her cheek she told me she couldn…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Wow what a weekend I just had, let me tell you all about it! Last weekend it was the Queen&#039;s Golden Jubilee celebration down in London. My wealthy but divorced cousin Fran was very lucky and got two tickets in her grown up daughters&#039; names for the pop concert on the Monday night in the Garden at Buckingham Palace. Claire, 24 and Holly, 20, the two very good looking daughters, top shelf in fact, were to be the lucky recipients of the tickets. Both girls live in Chelsea. Fran asked me if I would like to go down to London for the weekend. Our families are very close as we all grew up together in the same town. Fran is 10 years older than I, and seems to be missing male company since her messy divorce. She felt…</p>
