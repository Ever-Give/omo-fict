        <p class="card-text">At about 1 am, David wakes. The 55–year–old man is at once conscious of the insistent twinge of need brought on by a full bladder. He ignores it, noting the rush he gets as he grabs his stirring member to stem a stronger momentary urge. He pours a tall glass of water and gulps half of it at once while dancing in place. To the uninformed, his actions might appear at odds with sanity. He turns on the computer, checks email then browses through the special sites that interest him. The glass is empty now and he refills it. David downloads a couple of free utilities. He cannot get comfortable, dares not relax. Again the glass is empty. He knows he cannot refill it now without wetting himself. He tries to…</p>

I&#039;ve washed his socks, cooked his dinner, dusted the house– in fact I&#039;ve done all the things a housewife used to do in the &#039;good old days.&#039; Before you tell me I&#039;ve given up my feminist principles I should tell you that Robert has done the same for me. In that time we have never had an argument and I&#039;ve never been happier.
Throughout last summer we drifted around the canals of England, stopping for the night in shady corners, away from the towns and continued to play our games whenever the mood took us. That is to say several times per week. Once we were caught by a farmer in the corner of his field where we had lain down for cuddle and a piddle. We were both wet…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Caught out and Caught Short
When we are at home and May is going to be there alone in the evening I suggest that she locks the door after about 7 in the evening because we have had a spate of conmen trying gain entry. The summer had ended and it had turned cool with rain almost every day. I had to go to a meeting that finished after 9 and would not be back till after half past. In order to be linked we had a meal together as well as a large bottle of fizzy orange. My meeting would end with a cup of tea so she promised to have one at the same time. We would wait till I got back to let it out. 
Well, the meeting lasted a bit longer than expected, as did the tea drinking so both of us had an extra cup. On the…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Cherry went to sit down at the computer. She wanted another wet session, so she logged onto the Internet to look at some sexy pictures of other women peeing and getting desperate. She liked that because earlier she had drunk two large mugs of orange juice in quick succession. She was wearing a pair of white jeans and a sky blue top and had placed a large towel underneath her. While on her seat, she started fidgeting slightly. That felt good, shifting on her bum. She was beginning to enjoy herself. Then she logged on to a chatroom of one of her favorite fetish sites. She began talking to someone who was known only as username Demon.
&quot;How are you today?&quot; she asked.

It happened soon after we met, in the autumn (fall) when everything was damp and dismal outside. I had been persuaded to take more care over my appearance having seen what a difference a ribbon and a belt can make to the dullest outfit. Robert took me to a clothes shop called Young Miss. As I&#039;m a poor sort of shape it never crossed my mind that anything could be done about being like a vertically compressed 8.
First he took me to a rack of jeans and slacks, borrowed a tape from the assistant and asked me to stand on tiptoes and reach above my head. He whisked the tape round my hips before I…</p>

The central character in this is a tunnel. Luckily there are quite a few tunnels on the canal system so we can hope to remain anonymous. May has two weeks holiday in the summer so we aim for peace and complete isolation traveling for ten of the fourteen days and stopping anywhere that takes our fancy. The journey would include the passage of two long tunnels that are quite claustrophobic.
During the initial wet weekend we stocked up on food. It was a Saturday morning when the fun began. The game of the day…</p>

I left the tools on the bank. Now arriving at Weedon with the prospect of better things you&#039;ll appreciate that discovering that the tools still lay neatly beside the towpath where I had put them was a blow to my system.
May is right, I am very proud of my fine engine but its no good without the tools to maintain it. Some people are worse in a crisis than in the steady run of life. That&#039;s how it is with me.

Uxbridge is some way from the center of London but it&#039;s on an underground line. When we stopped the boat there, it was convenient to have a day out in the big city. My &#039;social education&#039; started when Robert began to show me how I could dress to make better use of what he calls &quot;my graces.&quot; Then he forced me to meet all sorts of people who cruise around the canals. One of these was a professor in a London University college. We had decided to go to see him and his wife at their home in Muswell Hill.

        <p class="card-text">We married quite young; I was twenty–one and Tracy was twenty. I had admired her shapely body in the tight jeans for some time before things fell into place and we started dating. We got married within a year.
I first met her sister at the wedding. Lynn was eighteen with a slender body, usually dressed in tight, short dresses and skirts, or leggings and t–shirt. Tracy didn&#039;t mind me noticing her sister. Isn&#039;t she cute? She used to say, &quot;don&#039;t you just love her?&quot; Not as much as I love you, was my truthful answer.
The summer after the wedding we spent two weeks at Tracy&#039;s family&#039;s summerhouse by the sea. One day Lynn turned up unexpectedly. &quot;Time to check out the happy couple,&quot; she said. &quot;Still in love?&quot;

First drink, we always prefer water, 2 pints, and 1200ml each in less than an hour. Next, go for a brisk walk to get the system working. Two hours after the first cup we are back and holding but not desperate. The third move is to place two chairs side by side and take precautions against flooding, such as thick towels or a plastic sheet on the floor.

Many pleasures fade with repetition and we soon found that the things we enjoyed on our own no longer held the same satisfaction when we were together. Sitting at the computer with tight wet jeans or a nappy for example led on to masturbation when alone but together we just felt a trifle silly. Now neither of us continues with it.
Bedwetting was at first a great turn on but eventually it became a nuisance so we stopped that. A friendly human body becomes quite warm and damp enough when cuddled without the need to do excess washing each…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Have you ever heard someone say they wouldn&#039;t wash the place where you kissed for a week? It&#039;s usually a jest. I&#039;ll never hear it again without a shiver. We met up with a couple from Swindon soon after returning to the boat one Friday evening. We asked them round for a drink after our custom when tied up next to another boat for the night.
The weather turned cool so we remained inside chatting and the conversation got round to wet matters because they asked about the line of damp clothing hanging by the fire. Our regular hold–it had degenerated into a mass spraying just as we settled down to the evening meal. You already know about May and me, how we have been in the watersports way for a few years together.…</p>

        <p class="card-text">This is an adaptation of a true story––– some things have been altered a bit for better flavor.
The last time I got together with my friend Carol, it was a chance meeting that had us both on my motorcycle in the mountains and finished with the best sex ever. Carol was determined that we would meet again, only on her turf next time...
Well, It so happened that I had to go on a trip to visit a relative and it put me just a few hours from where Carol was now living. I called her to let her know and she was really excited. She started to tell me all the things she was going to plan and I had to shut her up. I wanted to be surprised instead.
This time, I followed the directions to where Carol was going to be and…</p>

        <p class="card-text">I get so hot and bothered down below, you know what I mean, when I play games with Robert that I sometimes want to loose control of myself completely. He says I shouldn&#039;t because our ages are so different. All I can do is tell you what went on last time we met and hope that someone can offer a solution.
Robert has a boat and spends his life floating around the canals of England. Last weekend he asked me to meet him near Burton–on–Trent at 6 on Friday evening. After work I had a really good drink and caught the train. By 6 I had been on the way for 2 hours and it was another half hour walk to his boat. There&#039;s probably a lot of nice respectable people in Burton so they were probably rather shocked by seeing us…</p>
