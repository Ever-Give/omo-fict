It was the Friday of Spring Break. 18 year old Emmie finally had her dorm room to herself. Her roommate had left earlier that afternoon, along with all of the other girls. She herself would be leaving in the morning, to go spend the week in the mountains with her boyfriend, Eric, but tonight was hers and hers alone.She filled the bathtub up with hot water, and got everything she needed ready: three huge bottle of her favorite sports drinks, her favorite pajamas, a bottle of personal lubricant, and her trusty little blue friend, the vibrator she had bought back in high school. Emmie slid out of her silky black robe (a gift from Eric) and started to step into the bathtub. She then remembered…</p>

        <p class="card-text">It was a cold, wintry day, when Sarah woke up. It was still dark outside and the wind was blowing hard against the window. She immediately noticed her very bad need to pee. She was almost bursting. The need was so bad that she was actually frightened to move. She felt that any tiny movement might make her loose bladder control immediately.
She was laying there, in her nice, warm bed, with her comfy terrycloth pyjamas on, her heart hammering against her chest. &quot;I need to get up,&quot; she thought. &quot;I need to go to the bathroom, quickly!&quot; &quot;I can&#039;t move. I just can&#039;t, or I will pee the bed&quot; was the immediate afterthought.
Trembling, she was lying there, trying to make up the courage to try it. To make herself hold…</p>

Tanja and I were together in Mexico. It still seemed so surreal even as I lay beside her in bed that first morning in a five star beachside resort. It was already getting quite warm even though it couldn&#039;t have been past 9:30. I considered getting up to turn on the AC before it got too hot, but didn&#039;t want to leave the comfortable bed just yet. Tanja was still sleeping beside me, completely nude. 
It had been a long but fun night. We had gotten drunk back in L.A., but not drunk enough to be restricted from flying. We had taken a cab to the airport, already desperate from the alcohol we had consumed. We…</p>

The first seven weeks of my new job flew by. I was really busy with work, learning many of my tasks on the fly. I was glad that I had paid attention in school; I knew the basics of my job very well. However, there were still many aspects of my job that had been taught lightly or not at all. I worked hard to learn the ropes of the trade and complete my tasks as quickly and effectively as I could. My boss, Mr. Brokovich had been pleased with how well I was picking up things, but it was really all Tanja&#039;s doing. She was a great mentor, both in accounting–related matters and in love.

Although I would consider myself adventurous, wetting myself was not really something that interested me particularly before I met Jana. However, our first episode, which is listed in the stories as &#039;Splash Back&#039;, made me aware of how much Jana enjoyed this.
It is quite good fun I guess, in a rebellious way; and doing it always makes Jana more interested in me. I don&#039;t have a problem playing his games and it is just another, different kind of intimacy we share. I have done it when I have been on my own too, so that I get caught…</p>

When the classes were done for the entire year, the students had to take a math exam this one particular day, and after 3 hours every student had finished the test and left the school. By that point, I had to pee kinda badly. 
During the test, I think I had drunk at least a litre and a half of water, and I didn&#039;t get a chance to use the washroom that morning either because I overslept. Plus, I had drunk around 2 large cups of coffee that morning as well. But I decided to hold it in because I had a lot of exams to grade and such.

It was a hot day, hot even for the south of Spain, and the three girls were all feeling the heat. The three girls in question are Courtney – a brunette of around 5&#039;8&quot;, Hannah – a blonde with an inch of height on Courtney, and Tiffany – another darker brunette of around 5&#039;6&quot;. All three girls were slim and fairly lightly built. The three girls had gone to secondary school together, and having just finished sixth form, were enjoying their summer before they went away to university. They started with a trip to Spain – they were to spend several weeks in the country, joining various tour groups and being shown the sights.
On this particularly hot day, the girls were being shown around a museum.…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Lisa walked into the room and saw Christy going through her purse. She turned around and handed Lisa two twenty–dollar bills. Lisa looked up at Christy confused and Christy smirked at her, saying, &quot;If you&#039;re going to be wetting your pants like a baby, then we need to treat you like one! I want you to go to the store and buy some diapers and a pacifier. Also buy a pair of handcuffs.&quot;
Lisa threw her arms in the air and looked down at her soaking wet jeans. Christy smiled and said, &quot;You&#039;re going just like you are now.&quot; She looked up at the clock. &quot;Hurry, baby, I&#039;m timing you.&quot; Christy lay on the couch and turned on the television. Lisa, red faced as ever, thought about telling Christy to go to hell, but in the…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Jenny sighed and snuggled down into the inviting depths of Sam&#039;s double bed. The combination of cocoa and lavender scent was making her feel drowsy already, and she began to doze in next to no time. She was only vaguely aware of the bedroom door opening, and Sam padding softly across the room to the bed, turning back the covers, and climbing in beside her.
&quot;Jenny?&quot;
&quot;Mmmm?&quot;
&quot;You don&#039;t mind if I join you, do you? It&#039;s just I&#039;ve not made up the bed in the spare room, and the cat&#039;s already ensconced for the night on the sofa.&quot;
Jenny felt a little uncomfortable about the idea of sharing a double bed with her friend, but she didn&#039;t feel she was in any position to object. It was, after all, her friend&#039;s bed: and…</p>

        <p class="card-text">*** Why Is The Bed Wet?
I met this girl named Kate about a year ago. We were both 25 at the time and we have been dating since. Things were going well for us. But recently Kate began having this problem...
&quot;Kate, Why is the bed wet?&quot; I asked as I woke her up from a sleep.
&quot;WHAT?&quot; Kate yelled as she sat right up in bed. &quot;Oh my god! I ... I wet the bed!&quot; Kate was sitting in a large puddle in the bed. The sheets were wet enough that you could see liquid being squeezed out of the fabric as she moved. I woke because I felt the wetness seep over to my side of the bed and found my pajamas wet as well. Kate had a sheer panic look on her face and tears were forming in her eyes.
&quot;Shhh ... Kate it&#039;s ok, accidents…</p>

        <p class="card-text">It&#039;s a long–assed way from the nation&#039;s armpit to its belly button. We were driving all the way from home (NE, US) to southern Indiana, where we planned to ride our bikes (along with 250 other bike nuts) hundreds of miles through the hill country. We decided to split the drive into 2 days and play along the way. Early on the morning of day 2 we stopped in Wal–Mart to pick up another camp chair so there would be someplace to sit at the end of the day...just in case. After we found the perfect chair, and restocked the cooler with water and soft drinks, I started for the checkout line.
But OSO headed me off, herding me instead to the pharmacy section. He&#039;d never been in this town before in his life, but he…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Jamie was at her aunt&#039;s house, visiting her sick cousin. Nothing serious, just a bout with the flu, but her cousin was too tired and exhausted to get out of bed for anything, including to pee. So her aunt had bought her dear cousin Marie teenager–sized diapers, to make things easier on her. Her aunt needed to run some errands, so Jamie stayed to keep Marie company.
&quot;So, um, I&#039;m really sorry you&#039;re sick.&quot;
&quot;Yeah, me too, but it&#039;s not so bad being waited on hand and foot, and having your diaper changed like a baby.&quot;
&quot;Geez, I don&#039;t know about you, but I could never go back to diapers, having someone know when I&#039;ve peed or pooped, and having them change me.&quot;
&quot;Oh, but I enjoy it. Not to mention, between you and…</p>
