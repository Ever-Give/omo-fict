        <p class="card-text">Nissa shivered with excitement as she hung up the phone. She had just received a call from Lindsey Hoover. LINDSEY HOOVER!!! The guitarist and lead singer of the band she had worshipped practically all her life! In her wildest dreams of becoming a rock star, she had never anticipated THIS. A 5&#039;1&quot;–110 pound, black–haired eighteen year old who had just graduated high school last week was going on tour with her favourite band, TrashFlinger! She HAD to be dreaming. Nissa pinched herself to make sure she was awake before dialling up her band mates to reveal the news. Since Grade 8, Nissa and her best friends had been fans of TrashFlinger, a local punk rock band that had been kicking around for almost ten years now.…</p>

It was by no means the tallest tower in New York City, but definitely one of the city&#039;s finest. It had been constructed over the past two years, 1988 and 1989.The rumour on the street whispered that it had cost Stephen Burns Jr. over twenty million dollars.Glancing at the directory sign, Karen confirmed that she was going to the top floor and hit the elevator button. She took a sip of her large coffee as the elevator arrived. It had been a restless night, with a big day looming. She had finally fallen asleep around 3 am, only to be awakened by her alarm four hours…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Heather hesitantly stepped out of her car and walked towards the gym entrance. She felt nervous and excited at the same time. She was finally addressing her weight concerns with this three–month program. A 5&quot;9 natural blonde with a busty build, she had been the talk of her high school in her younger years. Now 28 years old and a manager at the local Walmart, she had seen her weight skyrocket nearly twenty pounds in past eighteen months, following a bitter break–up with a boyfriend of three years. Despite the weight gain, she still got plenty of lustful stares from men when she walked around the store.Heather showed her ID to the brunette at the front desk and was directed to Training Room B, down the hall on…</p>

After weeks of training and renovations to the bar, it was finally Grand Opening Day. Though it was Misty&#039;s bar, Kiran and Jamie felt as much a part of the project as she did. In fact, they had let Misty know that they were willing to work on tips alone if things didn&#039;t work out as well as planned at the start. However, Misty was hearing none of it– she was convinced the bar was going to be a great success.Misty had named it the &#039;Wild West Games Bar&#039;, which fit well with the old building located in the outskirts of town. However, the best part of the name was the neon sign. Misty had made it so only certain…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Two weeks had passed since the eventful sleepover at Jamie&#039;s house. Both girls had grown to need the others touch. This had led to some incredibly risky lovemaking outside their homes– at the movies, in the quiet corners of the public library, even the bathroom stalls at school. The risk of getting discovered turned them on immensely and they had barely escaped some close calls. Jamie received a phone call from Misty the day after the wetting incident at the bar. Being the experimental type and a closet wetter for many years, Misty was dying for more fun with Jamie and Kiran. However, getting to Mistys apartment during her free hours was a difficult task for the two schoolgirls living under the close…</p>

She could feel the wet warmness on her arms and took care not to let the bundle dampen her t–shirt. Jamie was in the washroom getting cleaned up after peeing her bed and as her first act as Kiran&#039;s master, she had instructed her to put the wet laundry into the washing machine.Kiran inhaled deeply to enjoy the scent of her girlfriend&#039;s pee one last time before tossing the bundle in. She wondered what Jamie would have in store for her– she would certainly feel compelled to get payback after what had just happened. Her vagina tingled at the thought of being subjected to all of Jamie&#039;s sexual demands. She hoped…</p>

Kathy had invited her over for an end of semester &quot;surprise&quot; that Saturday. Sharon had no idea what to expect, but was hoping for more pee fun with her professor.
Sharon dressed herself in tight jeans which showed off her perfectly shaped athletic ass and a tight pink t–shirt under a heavy winter coat. Kathy greeted her with a hug and a quick peck on the lips at the door. Sharon was pleased to see her eyes wander over her body as she invited her in. Kathy led her to the kitchen where a large pot of hot chocolate was brewing. Sharon immediately accepted Kathy&#039;s offer of a hot drink and excitedly watched her…</p>

She had been selected to participate in a foreign exchange program in Tokyo over the summer. Only one spot was available for all the Psychology students at Fairmont College and Sharon suspected that she had been selected as a result of the letter of recommendation from her professor, Kathy.
In Japan, she was living in a fourplex with Abby, a fourth year sciences student at her college. There were also Cho and Mika who were in the nursing program at The University of Tokyo. They had been great with showing the girls around the University and social circles in the city. It…</p>

Not only had she learned some valuable life skills, she had also discovered some activities she really enjoyed– rock climbing, paintballing, target shooting, even wetting her pants. The trainers had stressed that the girls were contractually obliged to keep silent about what had taken place over the past six weeks and were not even permitted to talk to each other about the camp once they had left the premises.

        <p class="card-text">Sharon felt a mix of anxiety, anticipation, and excitement as she lay awake in the lower half of the bunk bed. Her watch told her that it was 6:56, just a few minutes from her wake–up call and the start of her first day of cadet training at North Hill Military Academy. She had just checked in last night after a 4 hour bus ride from her hometown, where she had lived all her life. She was pretty excited to be away from her parents for the first time in her 18 years, having just finished her first year of Psychology at Fairmont College, a twenty minute drive from her house.
Sharon felt fortunate being able to live at home attend college on a full scholarship, which cut down her costs of education to virtually…</p>

Mandy&#039;s life had changed dramatically in the past 2 months. Her boyfriend, Doug had recently asked her to move in with him and she had happily accepted. Doug&#039;s client base was growing rapidly and the law firm had gotten very busy. With the busier workdays, there had not been as much time for wet fun at work. It had gotten so busy that Doug had to hire a junior lawyer to help him keep up with the workload.
Mandy had been forced to make adjustments as well. Last month, Doug had told her he would have to hire a secretary more experienced in the law field, because of the huge call back list of clients he…</p>

Mandy had an unusual relationship with her boss and lover, Doug. Outside of work, he was everything she could ask for in a man; he was kind, passionate, and extremely fun to be with. However, the situation was a little different at work. He had requested that their relationship should be kept a secret for now, because it looked unprofessional and he was fearful of getting of being perceived as someone who took advantage of women who worked for him. He asked her to continue to address him as Mr. Welsh at work and not to show any public displays of affection at the office. He promised her that he would tell…</p>

Mandy looked at her reflection in the mirror for the umpteenth time that morning. She had to make sure that she looked perfect. It was an important day for her– she had to make sure she looked as attractive as possible. She was dressed in a tight white t–shirt with no bra, showing off her perfectly round breasts and erect nipples. She wore a tight denim skirt, short enough to reveal her light pink cotton panties when she bent over. She wished she was brave enough to wear her favourite pair of skinny jeans, but couldn&#039;t bring herself to risk the consequences of that just yet.
Mandy had been preparing for…</p>

        <p class="card-text">The Seattle city center traffic was so bad that it was often joked that it caused people to become junkies and then kill themselves. It made sense as the city was famously known for being the center of the early 90’s grunge scene, a short–lived but significant era in rock music, with bands such as Nirvana, Alice in Chains, Pearl Jam, and Soundgarden. Two of the more influential grunge bands, Nirvana and Alice in Chains abruptly ended following the suicides of their lead singers in the mid 90’s.
Mandy, currently stuck in the same afternoon Seattle traffic, sighed deeply as her frustration mounted behind the wheel of her 2004 Volkswagen Golf. She was on her way home from work, a commute that was no more than 20…</p>
