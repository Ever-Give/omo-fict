Tanja and I were together in Mexico. It still seemed so surreal even as I lay beside her in bed that first morning in a five star beachside resort. It was already getting quite warm even though it couldn&#039;t have been past 9:30. I considered getting up to turn on the AC before it got too hot, but didn&#039;t want to leave the comfortable bed just yet. Tanja was still sleeping beside me, completely nude. 
It had been a long but fun night. We had gotten drunk back in L.A., but not drunk enough to be restricted from flying. We had taken a cab to the airport, already desperate from the alcohol we had consumed. We…</p>

The first seven weeks of my new job flew by. I was really busy with work, learning many of my tasks on the fly. I was glad that I had paid attention in school; I knew the basics of my job very well. However, there were still many aspects of my job that had been taught lightly or not at all. I worked hard to learn the ropes of the trade and complete my tasks as quickly and effectively as I could. My boss, Mr. Brokovich had been pleased with how well I was picking up things, but it was really all Tanja&#039;s doing. She was a great mentor, both in accounting–related matters and in love.
Before I knew it, it was Friday…</p>

Things were going well between Tanja and me. I was madly in love with her and I could feel that she had a growing liking to me as well. We did have our differences though. I wanted nothing more than to be with Tanja all the time. She was absolutely amazing in every way. She was the woman I had only seen in my dreams until now.
However, Tanja was more non–committal and tended to shy away from any discussions of getting to know each other better. She seemed to want to keep her options open and rolled with life as it came, taking in all of each and every experience. I had told her that I was okay with…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Things have taken an unlikely turn at my workplace. I feel very fortunate to have met Tanja, but sometimes wish that it had happened outside the workplace. I doubt I would have been as fortunate with her at a bar or a club. It was something that was destined to happen exactly the way it did. Tanja and I hadn&#039;t even gone out together outside of work or even talked on the phone. I didn&#039;t know anything about her life outside of what I had seen at work. I didn&#039;t know if she had a boyfriend or even girlfriends other than Selena. I wanted to know more about Tanja and considered asking her about her life, but was afraid to come across as interrogating. Tanja was a free–spirited woman, willing to take life by the…</p>

My new job has kept me very busy to say the least. I begin work at 9:00 am each morning and quit at 5:00 pm. There is usually a few hours of work left over that I complete at home for clients coming in the next morning. Despite the big workload, I am enjoying my job. A big reason for this is the money. It is nice to be able to eat real meals after living on Kraft Dinner for the past six years. I am even considering moving out of my rented apartment and buying a place within the next year, a big step for someone just a few months out of university.
Without a doubt, the best part of my job is Tanja. I fell in love…</p>

        <p class="card-text">I am writing about my experiences with a very special woman that I felt very fortunate to meet even if it was for a limited time. It all started with my new job at an advisory and management accounting firm in Los Angeles. I had just graduated from university at the age of 23 and was a little inexperienced in the relationship department. I had never had a girlfriend or even a high school sweetheart. All my sexual experiences had come from binge–drinking campus parties and one–night stands. Admittedly, I was glad to get out of the college life and into the real world, where was I hoping to find a more meaningful relationship that I had not found up to this point.
I had graduated with good grades from a…</p>
