        <p class="card-text">This is a story about a time when I went with my college roommate and some of my girlfriends to my dad&#039;s cabin up in northern Wisconsin. Anyway we got up there and we were having a great time when my roommate, Abby, had to use the bathroom. She went in and came out and said that the bathroom didn&#039;t work. So I said to go outside. She went outside and came right back in and said that some guys from college had followed us up there and they were waiting outside. Now there were 5 girls and 4 guys and no working bathrooms. The guys came in and we all started drinking. All this time I had to go really bad and so did all of my friends from what I could see. None of us wanted to go in front of them so we asked them to…</p>

        <p class="card-text">My name is Molly and my friend is Steffine. One day my neighbor asked us to babysit for their 5 year old girl and 8 year old boy. We went there right after school and Steffine didn&#039;t have time to stop at the bathrooms because the owner of the house said that we had to be there right after school. It was a long walk to their house. On our way there she said &quot;we gotta hurry, I haven&#039;t stopped at the toilets since lunch.&quot; So we started to pick up the pace to get to their house. Halfway there she said &quot;Stop for a second&quot; she then hunched over and put her hands in her crotch and started to groan. I asked her if she was alright and she said she was just fine and that she could make it. She regained herself and we…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Hi it&#039;s me, Molly. I am gonna tell you about another of my accidents. I was at my little sister&#039;s girl scouts&#039; cookout. My mom wasn&#039;t able to go so I went with my little sister. We drove there and there were about 75 little girls and their mothers also. We got out and I found my friend Ashlie. I was talking to Ashlie for a while when we decided to go out to the clubs tonight. It was perfect because my little sister already asked to stay at one of her friends&#039; house. I said it would be all right with me. Anyway we left and stopped at her house and then stopped at my house to change quickly and then we were off. Being the stupid person that I am I didn&#039;t go to the bathroom before I left. As we were driving I…</p>
