It is also my msn address. (Don&#039;t forget to remove the &quot;REMOVETHIS&quot; part) If anyone, preferably women, would like to role play wettings or even do some actual pee play on–line, just write me a mail, or add me to your contact list)
It was a day just like every other day after Inuyasha got over his little &quot;transformation.&quot; Unlike other times, they did not have to fight for their lives. It seemed as though the demons of the surrounding territories had taken a break from hunting them.
As soon as Inuyasha changed back to his demon form, he awoke. The act of…</p>

        <p class="card-text">We were young and innocent. She was nineteen and I was twenty–three when we moved into the small cheap flat after going steady for three years. No need to bore you with the story of second–hand furniture and the roaming of garage sales, we were soon ready to live happily ever after. Karin was of average height, with brown curls to her breasts, green eyes and a nice girly shape. She preferred jeans and a sweater, but wore the occasional dress to feel womanlier. I&#039;m an ordinary guy. The most out–of–the–ordinary about me she didn&#039;t know about. We had a good sex life when we first started, enjoying each other regularly. But the thing that really turned me on was – well, I didn&#039;t have the nerve to tell her. I had…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Sarah stood in front of the mirror, her heart beating, her hands trembling. She looked at herself, a brown–haired girl with a white sweater and a denim skirt, with smallish breasts, narrow waist and round hips; a quite ordinary–looking girl of nineteen. Then she lifted her skirt and revealed her panties, and under them, the bulkiness of diapers. Sarah had been looking after her friend Anne&#039;s two–year–old daughter for some time while Anne worked odd shifts at the hospital. Once, as Anne had showed her where the diapers were kept, Sarah had noticed another package. Anne had laughed, a little bit embarrassed, and said she had had some problems after giving birth, you know, leaking a little... Sarah had been…</p>

I don&#039;t know what I had been dreaming about or what caused this amazing hard on but it sure felt wonderful. It was particularly nice this morning because I really had to pee badly– very badly. In fact, I couldn&#039;t tell if I was about to cum or pee. In either event I was going to leave my sleepy wife in bed and go get some relief in the bathroom.
In the same second as I was about to throw off the covers and roll out, She turned towards me, flopped her arm down on my stomach and laid her hand across my dick. It seems she was about to wake up too and suddenly realized how big and hard I was. I couldn&#039;t tell her about how much I had to pee…</p>

She had waited all week for this day, when her parents would be out for the day, about 8 hours. That gave her plenty of time to do what she wanted, and clean it all up too. She would lay in bed at night, softly stroking her young pussy, and think about the day that would come, when she could live out her most wild fantasies. Her friend Jane was on her way...
Jane was into peeing too. Both she and Annie were only 18, but they had known each other since they were 5. They went through the everyday accidents of accidentally peeing in their pants when they were little. If one wet her pants, the…</p>

She had also never slept at my house either.

Sam&#039;s parents were going to visit her older sister, who had just had a new baby, so they would be gone as well, which left us either house available for our sleepover. Sam decided that she wanted me to stay with her at her house instead of coming to mine– and for some reason she…</p>

        <p class="card-text">The instructions in the letter from the hospital were quite clear. &quot;Drink at least 2 pints of water before you attend for Ultrasound scanning, and do not relieve yourself until after the scan. It is important for good results that your bladder is full at the time of the scan.&quot;
Kate was a normally healthy, slender 18–year–old, but she had been having trouble with pains in her abdomen, and the doctor had referred her to the hospital for a scan to see if anything would show up. Now she looked at the letter again. The appointment was for 10:30 a.m., so she didn&#039;t need to leave the house until at least 10, the hospital was only about 15 minutes&#039; walk away.
On the morning of the appointment, the alarm clock rang…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Lucy hobbled hurriedly up to the ladies loo with her hand clasped firmly between her legs. &quot;Please Miss Susan,&quot; she pleaded. &quot;I really need to go to the little girls&#039; room.&quot; Susan was in the middle of smoothing a &quot;Toilet Closed&quot; sign onto the toilet door. She had made this, her third desperation party, a fancy dress school disco themed party and it was so good to see everyone really getting into the spirit of it. Lucy was wearing a short blue pleated skirt, which was now bunched firmly between her legs, and her blonde pigtails and pained expression really completed the effect.
&quot;Is it urgent?&quot; asked Susan.
&quot;Yes miss, ooh it&#039;s an emergency!&quot;
&quot;Well you should have gone during break then, you know that the…</p>

        <p class="card-text">I am at work. I am married to the most beautiful woman in the world, and she never leaves my thoughts. As another boring day goes on I compose this story:
Michelle wakes up and stretches her light brown body, then curls up again knowing it is still early, letting her hands rub her round belly and a little further down as well. A little later she rises, naked, and enters the bathroom where she meets herself in the full–length mirror. She likes to be seen. At thirty–five she has a perfect butt– probably as a product of her Caribbean ancestry, and a narrow waist above full hips. Her breasts are quite small, but very pretty; her black hair reaches her nipples when she straightens it. She turns on the taps.

        <p class="card-text">The two girls were just hanging around outside the town&#039;s center, the burger stand. They were almost identically dressed, in tight designer jeans and white tops showing their bellies, one slightly rounder, and the other slightly shorter. Both had brown hair to their shoulders and were looking around to see where the action was. Being a local lad and an experienced hanger–around I immediately drifted over to see if I could be of service.
— Hi there, the tallest said. –Anything happen around here?
— This is it, I said. –First time here, right?
The shorter girl nodded. –We&#039;re staying at the hostel with our class, but got sort of tired of card games and giggling boys.
Her friend poked her side and got a tickle…</p>
