        <p class="card-text">Hi! I really like your website. Something happened to me today that I want to share. There was a tube strike in London today and for the thousands of people who normally use the tube to get to work every day, it made things very difficult. I live a bit out of London and have to get a train in, and then normally get the tube to the office. With out the tube it&#039;s about an hour&#039;s walk from Waterloo station. I don&#039;t bother with buses, as they are too full and stop at every street, so they would take ages to get me where I want to go. Anyway, I got to work in the morning OK. Work was the same as usual, but in the afternoon I started feeling a bit tired, so started to up my coffee intake. I was also feeling quite…</p>

        <p class="card-text">From an early age I discovered that I obtained much sexual pleasure from holding my pee until I was really desperate. I&#039;ve often played little games with myself whilst out and about just seeing how long I can hold out without going to the toilet. Last weekend I woke up needing a wee but decided to hold on. I was planning a shopping trip and the thought of walking around town whilst desperate to wee was already turning me on.
