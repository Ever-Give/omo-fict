        <p class="card-text">This is another story from my younger days. As you might know from reading my other stories I had a problem admitting to other people that I had to pee, especially when I was younger. There was one incident where it could have gotten me into a ton of trouble both with my parents and the owners of an appliance store. Let me explain.
Our refrigerator had broke, or was in the process of breaking so my parents decided to go shop for a new one after dinner. Now for some reason I had to come along. It was summer at the time, so I really can&#039;t think of a reason I would have been tagging along for something so boring. I must have been in trouble for something at the time but I can&#039;t quite remember if that was the…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Let&#039;s see where were we? Katia and I had just soaked ourselves outside and had gotten back on the trolley. We had peed so much our sneakers were starting to squish from the pee dripping off of our jeans down into them. This was the dead of winter remember so there was no way we were getting dry, and the warmth of our pee was fading fast.
&quot;We&#039;re gonna be freezing in no time,&quot; I said quietly to Katia.
&quot;We could just keep peeing to keep warm,&quot; she said jokingly. Then almost at the same time we realized that it might not be such a crazy idea. There was no heater on the tram and people were starting to open windows and yell out them so there we were going to be freezing in no time just like Andrea. She had…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Another Friday so why not tell another story? There were requests from some of you on what you wanted to hear about next but unfortunately I cant remember what they were at the moment. Sorry guys you&#039;ll just have to suffer with this one;) Actually I did get a fun idea from one of my &quot;fans,&quot; I&#039;m going to try re–enacting one of my desperate episodes to see if I could wait longer now than I did back then. Any suggestions on which of the ones you&#039;ve heard about you&#039;d all like me to re–enact?
I thought I&#039;d liven up the morning by telling you all about something that happened to me last year in Europe. They have these parties that take place on trolley cars. They call them tram parties. It was a lot of fun, not…</p>

        <p class="card-text">It&#039;s another down day at work, so I thought I&#039;d tell you another story about myself. I also thought it be fun if I told you how desperate I was while I&#039;m writing this. Now because I&#039;m at work I can&#039;t just write this whole thing out at once. Someone could come by and interrupt me, or something might come up. Usually when I write a story at work it takes most of the day. Right now it&#039;s 10am. I got here at 7am. Like all slow days it&#039;s tough to stay awake, and since I&#039;m new here I don&#039;t think it would be good for me to be found sleeping at my desk. So like everyone else to stay at least a little awake I&#039;ve been having lots of coffee. Well you might not consider 2 cups a lot, but it is for me. Add to this the 24oz…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Just for those of you that need a physical description to enjoy the stories here it is. I was going to just put a pic of my gf and me at the end of the story but then I changed my mind...sorry. Anyways, I&#039;m 5&#039;6, blond hair, hazel eyes, curvy with legs that just keep going forever ;) Lisa is 5&#039;3, black hair, and green/grey eyes, think mini Selma Hayek.
It&#039;s me again. I hope everyone enjoyed the last story. I had some more time to kill at work so I decided to write another one, or at least start one. Now there is another story I want to tell involving Lisa and me but I&#039;ll get to that one another time. Instead I&#039;ll go back to something that happened to me in high school.
Four friends and I went to see a movie.…</p>

I&#039;ve been reading the stories on this site since I was 18, it was such a relief for me that I wasn&#039;t the only one who was into holding my pee till I was about to or actually did wet myself. I kept meaning to share my personal experiences but I always seemed to get side tracked. Usually when I started to tell a story I&#039;d get so excited remembering what happened that well...I didn&#039;t have any fingers available for typing ;) But now I&#039;m 23 and at work, bored a lot, and I have a little more self–control. Not to say writing this isn&#039;t a major turn on but it&#039;s not like I can just put my hand up my skirt. There are tons of…</p>
