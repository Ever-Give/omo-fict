Lisa stirred slightly, sensing more than feeling movement on the other side of the bed. The mattress momentarily tilted as her companion swung her legs around and sat up. Briefly opening one eye she saw 5:47 in bright red digits on the hotel alarm clock. Closing her eye she settled back down for another hour of sleep.Drifting back into her slumber Lisa heard Sandi walking towards the bathroom. Sandi opened the door, lifted up the creaky toilet seat and after a few seconds Lisa recognized the familiar sounds of a full–blooded bladder–bursting morning pee splashing violently into the pan. Her last thoughts as consciousness…</p>

Sophie saw the queue of cars all trying to get into one place, the mall car parking lot. Sophie and her best pal Laura had decided to go shopping on this sunny Saturday morning. 
˜I can&#039;t believe how many people have decided to come shopping today!&quot; mentioned Laura as she sat patiently at the wheel of the car.

But just then the doors opened and everyone started getting in. She stepped quickly inside, hoping it wouldn&#039;t take more than a few minutes to get to her floor. She knew she could hold it for a few minutes. 
Amy&#039;s room was on the 26th floor. There were about ten other people on the elevator. They all pressed the buttons for their stops and the elevator began to move. Amy really had to go. Really badly. The cramping and burning sensation in her bladder was getting stronger. Why did she drink three martinis and then all those cups of coffee in the bar? She…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Hi. This is my true story and my name is Jennifer. 
I was looking through one of my old diaries (from when I was 18) and here&#039;s one that I found near the beginning pages, it was on one of my April school days. 
The day started out as usual, I woke up at about 8:30 and as part of my schedule I got out of bed needing to pee. But this morning my sister had swiped the out fit I had left in the hamper on the end of my bed and ran right to the downstairs bathroom. Since my sister was too lazy and she often left her side of the dresser completely messed up and I hadn&#039;t thrown my load of laundry in yet, I had been forced to rummage through her side of the dresser. She didn&#039;t organize things so sometimes her panties…</p>

I had just gotten up and it was a warm spring day outside. Jenny would be here any minute and because her car was in the shop we were going to take a cab there. I slipped into a short white skirt and some matching white cotton panties, I always like to coordinate. I was surprisingly thirsty, so I drank about three glasses of water and I slipped on a bra and a shirt. then, the doorbell rang, it was Jenny, &quot;Just a sec&quot; I said. I felt a small urge to pee but there was no time, so I ran to the door, grabbed some money, and we left.

This place is very familiar to us, as we do this twice a year. The beds are bunk style, but Chris and I remove the top mattress to make one larger bed on the bottom. We brought our own goose down comforters to place over the mattresses for comfort. We arrived Friday morning at 6 AM and began our day with a peaceful meditation, followed by a walk in nature. After swimming in the lake, we dressed for dinner. We went to a nearby bar and grille and had salads and lots of spring water.
