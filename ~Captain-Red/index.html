        <p class="card-text">Arriving at the starting point for their weekend camping excursion, the highschool girls unloaded their backpacks and assembled at the trailhead. The youth group was newly assembled from a suburban area, and many of the girls had never been camping before. The leader, Ann Gerlow, had spent quite a bit of time and effort getting them ready for this adventure, including making sure their boots were broken in, and spending a couple of nights in their tents in her back yard, and she foresaw no trouble with this brief foray into the woods. They would hike about 5 miles, make camp for the night, and return the following day. The forecast was for excellent weather. All the girls had the necessary equipment. They were…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Mike walked into Jan’s office; she’d been expecting him and had been saving her pee for most of the morning. It’s a little later than her usual lunch time, but she’s arranged to take a late lunch because she’s meeting a friend from out of town. He’s been holding his pee too, though not as long, and he feel the pressure as he greets her, cordially but not passionately because her office mate is there. They leave her office and head for the elevator. The door opens and they step in. As it closes, leaving them alone, he looks at her and grins, giving his semi–hard penis a little tweak. She grins back, raising one knee and crossing it in front of the other.
A dump truck full of gravel rumbles down a street…</p>

        <p class="card-text">As he piloted his small cabin cruiser along the edge of the Gulf Stream, Jim Maxwell noticed a stationary blip on the radar. That was not all that unusual, probably a fisherman. But as he got within sight of the object, he noted that it was not one but two boats, one a large sport fisherman, the other a “Cigarette” type speedboat. It was unusual to see boats nested like that in the open sea, so Maxwell decided to have a closer look. 
When he focused his binoculars on the boats, his blood ran cold. Two men on the after deck of the sport fisherman were taunting a woman, pushing her back and forth between them, taking turns roughly kissing and pawing her. He quickly rigged his sea anchor and launched his Zodiac,…</p>
