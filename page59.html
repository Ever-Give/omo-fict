Aleen downed her first one quickly as she was thirsty, refilled her glass and started sipping. About halfway through the movie Aleen started feeling her bladder get to the uncomfortable stage and got up to go to the loo. Bob grabbed her, pulling her into his lap and began kissing her. They kissed for a while as Aleen&#039;s bladder kept filling with all the coke they had been drinking and was feeling really overfull. She broke the kiss and went to get up again. &quot;Where you going baby?&quot; Bob asked pulling her back down onto his lap. Aleen winced as his arm constricted her bladder. &quot;I have to pee.&quot;…</p>

Nicole was the best speller in my class. One day, we had a spelling bee and the winner went on to the school competition. Being a horrible speller, I was the first out. I was sitting down and could see Nicole fidgeting. She&#039;s about 5&#039; 6&quot; and has long legs and long blonde hair. I could tell she was desperate because it was 5th period and she didn&#039;t go all day. After a few more rounds, she was shifting from side to side. She asked if she could go to the bathroom but the teacher said she couldn&#039;t go until after the spelling bee. Nicole whined and stayed quiet except for the noise when she switched feet. The spelling bee went…</p>

Her captor/host, once you managed to get past the horns and fangs, possessed an alluring charm far beyond physical appearance. He could be rough or brutal, but a gentle soul seemed to hide behind the gruffness, and Belle had made significant progress in bringing it out. Someday, he might even be a beast in appearance only; with a new personality and spirit to match he might find a way to regain his outward humanity as well.

Susan was feeling pretty good about herself right about now. She hadn’t been skiing for over five years, in fact, since her senior year at college. After a few near–misses and one head–over–heels fall it had all come flooding back and she had spent the last hour traversing down several of the medium–blue slopes with two of her more athletic friends. To top it all off she had also finally managed to get away with Jeff, her newly acquired boyfriend and things were going so well on the skip trip she had to pinch herself to make sure she wasn’t dreaming.

Let me describe her. Jill was a tall, slim brunette with beautiful olive skin, brown eyes, the perfect ass, and exquisite long legs. She loved to wear tight, sexy clothes... the kind that would make both men and women turn their heads when she walked into a room. Her favorite outfit was skin– tight faded jeans with a top that came down to just below her round, melon–like tits (she had these done). She could model jeans. She could wear these things –hot pants, micro mini skirts, even tight pants – and not look too trashy. Jill had a lot of fondness for teasing.…</p>

James and Sue set off at 6:00 a.m. to avoid traffic and spend the whole day. The trip to Portsmouth was fast and felt even faster as the conversation was fluid and easy. Sue was wearing a short red skirt and a white top and a little pair of pale pink string bikinis. Her long legs were tanned and very shapely and her white crop top complimented her little pert breasts. James bought Sue a nice white body shaper as a present and she put it on in the ladies’ room at a little restaurant in Salisbury where they stopped to replenish their tea supply. Sue…</p>

From the emergency phone we learned that something had jammed and the service man had been called. The time passed slowly, and I started talking with the other woman.

Sneaking a peek at her watch she was amazed to see that they had been asleep for nearly two hours.

The reason why she had entered my mind was a friend’s description of an incident that took place shortly before Susie’s fifteenth birthday, involving a jammed bathroom door. The Daleys didn’t live too far away from the apartment, I realised, and so there was a good chance that at least one of my two roommates would have met her.
