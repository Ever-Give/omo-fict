        <p class="card-text">Cherry went to sit down at the computer. She wanted another wet session, so she logged onto the Internet to look at some sexy pictures of other women peeing and getting desperate. She liked that because earlier she had drunk two large mugs of orange juice in quick succession. She was wearing a pair of white jeans and a sky blue top and had placed a large towel underneath her. While on her seat, she started fidgeting slightly. That felt good, shifting on her bum. She was beginning to enjoy herself. Then she logged on to a chatroom of one of her favorite fetish sites. She began talking to someone who was known only as username Demon.
&quot;How are you today?&quot; she asked.
&quot;I&#039;m just fine, thanks. How wet are you?&quot;…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Deirdre was late for work. She rushed out of bed at around 7:45am, got washed and changed into a navy blue business top and knee–length skirt with a white blouse and black shoes. She felt a slight twinge in her bladder, but ignored it because she felt she would use the toilet when she got to work.
However, when she got to her local station, she had to wait twenty minutes for the train. By this time, she felt the need to go even more and started slight fidgeting on the spot. She looked for a toilet at the station and found one, but when she walked to the toilet door, she couldn&#039;t open it– the sign on the front said &quot;Out of Order&quot;.
