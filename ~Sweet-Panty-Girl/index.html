        <p class="card-text">Thy was tied up. She was tied up well. She couldn&#039;t wriggle free. When the men had left before she had tried. They were behind a cop style mirror, where she couldn&#039;t see them, but they could watch every move she made.
Her wrists were tied behind her, fastened to her ankles. There was a rope around her knees, pulling them apart, and she was slightly suspended from above, where ropes under her arms held her up. Her body was arched back, pushing out her breasts, and her legs were apart enough that Thy knew the men would be looking at her pussy.
Occasionally she heard murmurs from behind the glass, and caught a word of English here and there. Thy was Japanese, and was in the country on a student exchange program…</p>

        <p class="card-text">The woman in the pictures is Sweet Panty Girl.
When Joni felt her bladder starting to fill as she sat at her desk working the report due to her boss before the end of the day, she considered taking a bathroom break, but was on a roll– and she wasn&#039;t really needing to go badly enough to warrant getting up and leaving her work.
Lunch had really dried out her mouth and made her rather thirsty so she downed the rest of her half full bottle of water and rolled a meter on her chair to refill it from the cooler in the hall outside her cubical. She drank a few sips from the refilled bottle and continued working.
About an hour&#039;s work later Joni&#039;s bladder was very full and she decided to finish off her paragraph…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Tina rushed into the bus station and threw her bags onto the floor while almost breathlessly she told the man behind the counter she needed a ticket for the bus going to Brisbane.She handed her money over quickly and glanced at the line on the bus. There was only one person having their ticket checked now. No time for her to use the bathroom in the station. Well there are toilets on the coach. I&#039;ll go when I get on, she thought to herself, grabbing her bags and walking towards the bus. She had her ticket checked and got onto the bus, taking a seat at the back. A very attractive guy about her age got onto the bus and sat down about 2 seats across from her, since it was the backseat which was a long one. He…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Aleen cuddled into Bob as the previews for the movie finished. Together they watched the video and sipped glasses of coke. Aleen downed her first one quickly as she was thirsty, refilled her glass and started sipping. About halfway through the movie Aleen started feeling her bladder get to the uncomfortable stage and got up to go to the loo. Bob grabbed her, pulling her into his lap and began kissing her. They kissed for a while as Aleen&#039;s bladder kept filling with all the coke they had been drinking and was feeling really overfull. She broke the kiss and went to get up again. &quot;Where you going baby?&quot; Bob asked pulling her back down onto his lap. Aleen winced as his arm constricted her bladder. &quot;I have to pee.&quot;…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Sara finished the bottle of coke and ran back to the dance floor with her friends. Nathalie and Joanne hammed it up with Sara for hours. Joanne excused herself to visit the loo shortly before the band finished the last set. The line for the ladies was huge. Nathalie and Sara wanted to leave and go to another club so they retrieved a protesting Joanne from the line. She put her hands to her crotch to demonstrate her need to pee. &quot;We&#039;ll go when we get to the next club&quot; Nathalie reassured her, starting to feel the pressure on her own bladder. The girls left the club and made their way to the car. By this time Joanne was frantic to pee. She was wriggling her bum around like mad trying to hold on. &quot;God I have GOT…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Nina glanced at her boyfriend Sam and giggled nervously as she squirmed around in her seat a little. She&#039;s had a full mega size soft drink and was starting to feel the effects of it in her bladder. Checking her watch she realised that she was only halfway through the movie and still had almost another hour to go, and it was a premiere she was NOT missing even a minute of because of for a bathroom break.
A bit further into the movie she was having trouble concentrating and sitting still and Sam noticed and asked what was wrong.
&quot;Oh nothing. I just have to pee really badly thats all. It&#039;s so bad I&#039;m thinking about going.&quot;
&quot;Oh god just hold it. The cinema is packed and you&#039;ll have to step on about 40 people…</p>
