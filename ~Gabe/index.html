        <p class="card-text">Holly sat on the low wall and tried to breathe slowly to calm down as she reviewed her situation. Three hours ago she&#039;d been shopping in town, in her short, tight red top that she still wore, and her cut off denim shorts, which had been stolen whilst she was being accused of shoplifting in a store, along with her handbag. Now she was just wearing a tight yellow bikini bottom to cover her most private parts. The large coke that she&#039;d drank over two hours ago was now stretching her bladder, and she was trying to walk home, not having money for a bus and not being allowed into a store to use the facilities in her bare feet and legs. It wasn&#039;t a bad outfit to walk round in during the summer – she liked to tease…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Holly strolled through the city shops without a care in the world. She was browsing for some new sports clothes, window–shopping mainly, and her only purchase so far had been a large coke from McDonalds. Holly was an outgoing girl, and was enjoying being 18 and home from college for the summer. She was wearing an old pair of ripped jeans that she had cut off into shorts, and a red vest with &quot;Party Girl&quot; emblazoned across her firm round breasts. The vest was tight and short, showing her nipples since she wasn&#039;t wearing a bra, while leaving her tummy bare and exposed.
