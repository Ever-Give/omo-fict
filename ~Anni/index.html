        <p class="card-text">It was a sunny but not too hot day in autumn. Carlene and I had agreed to meet after work to do a bit shopping and to enjoy the sun in a street cafe. It was already fairly cold in the morning, so that I had decided for an ankle length skirt and slightly thicker pantyhose. Carlene was wearing black leather pants that I had never seen on her before. They were skin–tight, reaching down to her lower legs, with zippers on the outside. Under those pants she was wearing black pantyhose and dark red ballerinas. Typically for her, her hose had runs at both heels one of which reached up to her pants. Although the ballerinas hid her toes, a huge run on her right forefoot allowed for the assumption that not too many of…</p>

        <p class="card-text">We were looking forward to this year&#039;s Rock Festival, with a lot of new groups being expected, and a lot of old friends to be met.
We, that is, three girlfriends and me, were planning to stay for all three days, with the nights to be spent in our four tiny one–person tents. We had learned from last year&#039;s festival that we should not bring with us too many spare clothes, as there would be no time nor space to change. At least we had decided to dress a bit more attractively, after our woollen–socks–and–sandals outfit had made us kind of outsiders last year.
This year, I decided to wear a plain black skirt, a bit less than knee–long and not too tight, together with black tights and ankle–strap sandals without…</p>

        <p class="card-text">I remember the first time I had let go in public. It took a while although I have regularly witnessed Carlene&#039;s &quot;purposeful accidents&quot; since the first time I had seen her do so. Several times my courage was just sufficient to wet my panties, not having more than one or two drops fall down between my legs. For a long time it has not been before my return home that I had the courage to completely relax my muscles – on the toilet or in the shower, of course without taking off my pantyhose, skirt or panties.
It was on a Saturday. The whole department had a training seminar on our new customer care software. We had the training organised in a conference Centrum downtown, followed by a common dinner with the three…</p>

        <p class="card-text">It was one of these summer evenings where it just doesn&#039;t want to get cooler. We were sitting on the terrace of a roadside caf&#039;, eating a salad and drinking glass after glass of juice.
We had come here directly from work, so that we were both still wearing our business clothes, i.e. blouses, skirts and pantyhose. Carlene had taken off her pumps directly after leaving the office so that two tiny runs had developed up her calves, embellishing her seemingly brand new nylons.
Carlene leaned back in her chair, looking totally relaxed and happy, and closed her eyes. I had seen that behavior a couple of times before, and I was pretty sure about what she would do right now. And yes, she just emptied her bladder – as…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Hi, my name is Anni van Beek, and I found this site quite by accident. I live in Seattle, but I am of Dutch origin, and I have moved here with my parents when I was 9. (That is why neither my Dutch nor my English is close to perfect...)
I would like to tell you how I got into what others would call &quot;strange habits,&quot; and actually, I can tell stories that would fill a book.
It all started when I met Carlene. We work in the same insurance company, two cubicles apart. We often had lunch break together (we still have) and became fairly open to each other.
Back to Carlene– she looks like what the boys would call cute, seeming a bit naive sometimes.
She had told me once that her parents had always been very…</p>
