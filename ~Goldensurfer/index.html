        <p class="card-text">Rachel cursed herself. She couldn&#039;t believe she&#039;d let the deadlines for her paperwork get so close. Now she was stuck at her desk trying to finish up before the evening UPS pick–up came. The contracts for the publisher&#039;s authors for the next year had to go out today so they could be filed in time. Otherwise the company would lose money on its contracts, and Rachel would lose her job.
She was also cursing everything she&#039;d had to drink today. Her bladder was being stretched beyond limits holding the remains of all the cups of coffee and her giant soda from lunch. Rachel had been so busy thrashing on her contracts she hadn&#039;t noticed a need to visit the bathroom, but now she was at the point her bladder could be…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Carly squirmed behind the counter as she handed her customer a bag, &quot;Thanks for shopping with us,&quot; she said with forced cheer. The extra large coke she had during her break was back with a vengeance, her aching bladder screaming for relief. Normally she would have been able to get someone to cover her counter for a pee break, but it was the day before Christmas and they were short people because of a flu bug going around.
Just as she thought she&#039;d make a break for the bathroom anyway, a woman came up to the purse counter she was working.
&quot;I&#039;m looking for a purse for my daughter but I&#039;m not sure what she would like.&quot;
Carly groaned inwardly. This was going to be trouble. She didn&#039;t know how much longer she…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Laura Diaz rocked nervously watching Annika Sorenstam line up her putt. Diaz&#039;s bladder kept sending urgent relief signals, forcing the LPGA professional to squeeze her thighs together as best she could to hold her bladder in place. Unable to figure out why she needed to go so badly, Laura refocused on her game as Annika sunk her putt and moved away. Meanwhile, the foursome of Kelli Kuehne, Carin Koch, Beth Bauer and Natalie Gulbis paced the fourteenth green, each in their own gut wrenching battle with their bladders. Each used their caddies as cover to make a quick grab of relief in their crotch while no one looked. Kelli, glancing at the crowd, noticed several spectators bobbing up and down nervously, as they…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Squirming nervously, Jenni felt the sweat trickling down her back as the four armed men paced around the room watching. Four hours ago, a group of masked gunmen had stormed their high school, taking a large part of the school hostage. Arriving too late to help, the police held position around the school perimeter. Watching, like the rest of her classmates, Jenni waited for something to happen. Unfortunately, it wasn&#039;t what she wanted.An hour ago, her filling bladder started sending signals to her brain. Now those signals were urgent, but she was too scared to ask for the bathroom. Noticing some of her friends were in the same position was some comfort, but that comfort was eroding quickly as her bladder…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Carly squirmed nervously in her seat, her aching bladder sending constant signals to her brain for immediate release. She hadn&#039;t been to the bathroom all day, and the coke at lunch plus all the water she drank during P.E. were ready to make their exit from her. Normally this wouldn&#039;t be a problem, but some street workers outside the high school had hit a water line, and the water had to be shut off to the school. Quickly after that, the administrators locked all the bathrooms to prevent any messes and problems. There were supposed to be port–a–potties on the way, but so far not one had appeared.Mr. Rawlins was talking about Dickens in their English class, so Carly was bored enough that all she could think of…</p>
