        <p class="card-text">I&#039;m writing this first bit because Robert had to go on his least favorite outing to empty the toilet tank on our boat. We were trying some new ideas last weekend and one of them was a real corker. I&#039;m a bit awkward over some words so I hope you&#039;ll forgive me. The game went like this. First drink, we always prefer water, 2 pints, and 1200ml each in less than an hour. Next, go for a brisk walk to get the system working. Two hours after the first cup we are back and holding but not desperate. The third move is to place two chairs side by side and take precautions against flooding, such as thick towels or a plastic sheet on the floor.
Sitting on the chairs, the object is to help one another to hold on whilst we…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Over the past three years May and I have tried out as many variations of watersports as we could find the nerve for. The following represents our joint conclusions so far.
Many pleasures fade with repetition and we soon found that the things we enjoyed on our own no longer held the same satisfaction when we were together. Sitting at the computer with tight wet jeans or a nappy for example led on to masturbation when alone but together we just felt a trifle silly. Now neither of us continues with it.
Bedwetting was at first a great turn on but eventually it became a nuisance so we stopped that. A friendly human body becomes quite warm and damp enough when cuddled without the need to do excess washing each…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Each wet weekend May and I have three sessions. Friday there is the need to hydrate and that means establishing a level playing field. What with drinking tea and coffee as well as alcohol we often start off in a dehydrated condition so we play &#039;hold it&#039; to start with. If we meet in a public place its off to the pub and take in a pint or two of shandy followed by fresh orange. The task is then to reach the boat without losing any.
After eating, the next round is usually messy involving May finding interesting and unexpected ways to force me to put my clothing in the washing basket. Anticipating when she will do this has become one of my major tasks since she is cunning. Once she held until after the meal then…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Here&#039;s another letter from Robert and I but we&#039;ve tried to stick to what happened around the time of the &#039;floods&#039; at the end of 2000.
Robert&#039;s boat has been out of action for a while so we had our wet weekend at his house and you&#039;d be surprised how close it is to yours.
As usual I arrived at the station full to overflowing. Now I&#039;m not very good at geography and when Robert said to take the train to Dewsbury I thought it must be the station nearest to his house so it was a bit of a surprise when he said we had to go another half an hour by car.
He had borrowed a neighbor&#039;s car and so we had to keep it dry. I&#039;m all right in a train but the jiggling of a car plays havoc with my lower parts. I shuffled about…</p>
