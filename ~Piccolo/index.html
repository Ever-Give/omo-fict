        <p class="card-text">As we round the corner I spot her right away, there leaning against the lamppost with her gleaming legs tightly crossed, central to my vision like she had deliberately stood where I was going to look. &#039;How about her?&#039; I say to Howie, and with a grin he pulls over. The girl smiles and walks across to the car, and I&#039;m struck by this look she has– all bright and shiny, like the sunlight&#039;s just streaming straight through her. She&#039;s maybe twenty, twenty–one, not too tall, not too blonde, and with enough showing below the line of her little yellow top to tell me she must exercise her belly every day to keep it that shape. &#039;Are you going anywhere near Brinwell?&#039; she asks, and I give Howie a look that tells him we are…</p>

        <p class="card-text">John&#039;s attention was directed past the bright lights, the loud, thumping music and the hordes of drunken teenagers and young adults. He was concentrating on a girl in the queue, the same as he did every night. He had spotted tonight&#039;s girl almost immediately. She was dressed for fun, all bright colors. A super–short, bright green skirt, a tiny pink bikini top, and her chestnut hair bunched up into lots of little pigtails, each dyed with a splash of purple and tied up with rainbow–colored woolly bands, just enough to let a few loose strands brush her shoulders. She had been in line for almost twenty minutes now. When John had initially spotted her she was right at the back; now she was nearer to the ladies&#039;…</p>

        <p class="card-text">&quot;I don&#039;t know if I can hold it much longer,&quot; Kati snapped. &quot;Well you&#039;ll just have to,&quot; replied Captain Turner, &quot;just until we can determine who is and is not contaminated. You saw what happened to Joshua.&quot; Behind the captain, trapped behind a solid greenish force field, a terrible dark creature thrashed and bawled, all teeth and claws. What remained of Joshua&#039;s previous human body dangled in fleshy strings from its black, bloodstained fur, swinging as the creature tried to move.&quot;But, captain,&quot; she pleaded, &quot;you were there, you know how terrifying this ordeal has been for all of us. Since this all started yesterday evening I&#039;ve been waiting, too scared to stay in one place for long enough to go. Please, while…</p>

        <p class="card-text">She stood, with her hands together behind her back, her feet together side–by side, her back straight, her face forward. Standing to attention. Wincing against the intense feeling in her bladder, as though it would burst at any moment. In front of her, the giggling continued. &#039;I don&#039;t know who you are,&#039; she whispered, &#039;but this isn&#039;t funny.&#039; The giggling grew a little louder. She frowned, and wished she could duck down, or bend her knees, or do anything to stop this feeling that churned inside her, but she could not. Her name was Jodie Knight, and she had been on her way to work. She was only nineteen and had recently started a job working as a cashier at a local bank. It was fairly standard, all she ever had…</p>
