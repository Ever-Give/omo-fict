        <p class="card-text">Emily and I had hit it off from the time we had first met at a political gathering. She had approached me to provide positive commentary on something I had said at the meeting. From then on, I could easily tell she was sucking up to me, praising my &quot;brilliance,&quot; but in such a delicious way!
We dated for a few weeks. I invited her over to my place for dinner, and she reciprocated at hers. There&#039;s a considerable age difference between us, so initially we engaged as &quot;friend and mentor.&quot; Then one weekend when we were out hiking in an isolated canyon, she turned to me and said coyly, &quot;I need a bathroom, but I really detest the idea of dropping my trousers in this buggy place. Would you be terribly offended if just…</p>

        <p class="card-text">After what had seemed like an interminable Friday of classes at the NYU Downtown Campus, Katie McDonald, a 21–year–old graduate student in political economics, neatly arranged her books and materials in her tote pack and strode confidently out toward Washington Square. During the walk, she exchanged pleasantries with her classmates Rita Kudner and Boyd Hamilton, though declined an invitation to a student sleepover at someone&#039;s parents&#039; house on the Upper East Side. Katie had other things in mind.
Nearing the park, Katie managed to disengage from Rita and Boyd, who were heading for the subway. She strode over to a bench on the west side of the park, straightened her medium–length navy blue skirt and India…</p>

        <p class="card-text">My neighbor Darlene has always been one of the best neighbors one could hope for. I had known Darlene for years as a secretary in the Honors Program at the University, and had been quite surprised to discover when she moved in next door to me.
Back then Darlene had been the proud possessor of a body to die for. She had been blessed by nature with perhaps the most beautiful and bountiful breasts I had ever seen on a small (about 5&#039;3&quot;) slender woman. It was always a pleasure to observe her large nipples stand up and salute through whatever blouse she was wearing during our conversations over the low wall separating our houses.
Sadly, this sweet and supportive young woman made many mistakes in her choice of men…</p>

        <p class="card-text">I first met Joanna when I was a graduate student in biology at Tulane University in New Orleans. As an upper division life sciences major, I had been finally granted the coveted privilege of access to Tulane&#039;s renowned Herkimer Primate Biology Research Center. Joanna wasn&#039;t much older than I, but she had been one of those prodigies who had been granted admission to New Orleans prestigious Newcombe College immediate after her sophomore year in high school, and was currently engaged in the research underlying her doctoral thesis.
There was nothing at all pretentious in her manner as Joanna showed me around the laboratory adjacent to Herkimer&#039;s famous outdoor observation facility. I followed her with rapt…</p>

        <p class="card-text">There are nights in the deep South which seem to suit the human temperament to perfection. Visitors from other regions are frequently overwhelmed by the explosive profusion of vines and flowers covering every tree, bush, and lawn, providing not only a dazzling kaleidoscope of color but also filling the air with intoxicating scents. At night, when the whippoorwills keen their haunting refrain and the warm breeze rustles the branches and Spanish moss in the high, twisted oaks, the South can seem like a universe apart from the dirt and bustle of modern America.
I had been hired as a networking consultant at one of the most lavish country club settings in the South, far removed in distance, culture, and setting…</p>

        <p class="card-text">October 8, 2002 was a bitter day for our little software company. We had begun the firm almost as kids and soared to the heights of the tech boom not as millionaires, but amazingly affluent for young adults in our late 20s. Fortunately, we were a solid company with a good product. We didn&#039;t tank when the bubble burst, but we definitely were no longer looking at retirement in our 30s as we all had imagined.
What really stung, though, was when it became apparent that takeover by one of the larger telecom concerns was inevitable. The offer was reasonable, we had incurred minor debt, and there was no question our financial security depended on selling out to a more secure operation. We were coming out alright,…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Robin was a watersports fancier&#039;s dream comes true. At least she was my dream come true. Tall and willowy with blonde hair that cascaded down her shoulders and a sweet, very white, sort of baby face and sparkling, crystal blue eyes, Robin was of German–American ancestry.
Shortly after we began our relationship, Robin boldly stated, &quot;My main desire sexually is to do precisely whatever pleases you.&quot; She was kind of a sub, but far from being passive, exhibited an extremely ebullient, outgoing personality. She cajoled me to somewhat reluctantly confess to my watersports affinity; the first time I had done so in my entire life.
&quot;Ohhh, I just know that&#039;s going to be my thing!&quot; she exclaimed. &quot;I pee all the time,…</p>

She called herself Gypsy Goddess, and I her Gypsy King. The effervescent mind of this young Up–Easter would not be confined to the humdrum drudgery of rural central Florida, try as she might.
Nonetheless, I was largely unprepared for the flood of flaming femininity that accosted me, and I say accosted because I was almost immediately swept off–balance, when I first met her face to face.
The experience can only be described as slightly hallucinatory. Her youthful beauty stood much more profoundly in evidence than I had imagined from her conversation and pictures,…</p>
