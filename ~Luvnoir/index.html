        <p class="card-text">Vickie left her family&#039;s residence and her boyfriend in Philadelphia around 11:00 PM on Sunday. She was in route to Virginia Beach and she traveled down the eastern shore to get there. Traveling that late at night does not afford one a sufficient number of rest stops, and it was a very long drive. Vickie (a city girl) was still reluctant to bare her bottom to relieve herself even if she was to be covered by dense woodlands. As a matter of fact the denser the woods the more reluctant she was.
So, she was determined to make the entire six–hour trip without a bathroom break. She had never driven this far before so she wasn&#039;t quite sure what she was getting into. However, when she set out she was feeling good and…</p>

        <p class="card-text">It was 1960 when Vicky climbed aboard a Greyhound Bus affiliate that connected her hometown to the main line. It was the cheapest way for Vicky to get to Philadelphia where she had acquired a job writing copy for an advertising agency. It was a Friday morning and she had to report Monday morning at 8:00AM sharp. With the help of her parents she had already arranged for lodging in Philly and she had an advance in cash from her daddy to last until she got her feet on the ground.
