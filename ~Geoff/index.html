        <p class="card-text">We&#039;d moved from the shared house where Mrs X had danced so desperately outside the shared lavatory, (see Making her Wait – 1940&#039;s style) and therefore I never had another opportunity of making her wait to use it. Although many things were still rationed, such as meat, bread, butter and sweets, things slowly started to improve in the fifties (although not much) and we even spent the occasional day out, which meant using the generally rather primitive public conveniences at some time during the course of the day.
As a small boy, I quite often accompanied my mother into the ladies&#039; lavatories, waiting in line with her as she queued for a cubicle to become vacant. She always made sure she had an old penny in her…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Every detail of this story is completely true. When WW2 ended sixty years ago, my father was still in the RAF and my mother and I lived alone in a small flat at the top of a large Victorian town house in central London. We continued to live there until my father left the RAF some years after the war (he was a &#039;regular&#039; rather than an enlisted man) and we moved to other accommodation. The property was in a fashionable part of town, but had been &#039;requisitioned&#039; by the Government, that is &#039;borrowed&#039; from the rightful owners and divided up to give a roof over the heads of families made homeless by the war.
Every floor, of which there were five, had been converted into a self–contained unit, with cooking and…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Forty–five years ago I had an Uncle Ron and an Auntie Pam. Except that they weren&#039;t really an aunt and uncle – Ron was a long–term work colleague of my father and they met socially outside the office. I had called them aunt and uncle since a small boy and they treated me like the nephew they didn&#039;t have, with gifts at Christmas and birthdays and chocolate eggs at Easter.
Uncle Ron and Auntie Pam seemed to be quite well off by 1950&#039;s standards and owned an Austin A35 – a very small motorcar that preceded the internationally famous &#039;mini&#039;. We lived in a flat (what might now be called an apartment) in London and several times a year my father and I would accompany them on trips to the country. My mother hated…</p>

        <p class="card-text">(A completely true incident that occurred in December 2000)
The heat was rising in waves off the concrete apron of Adelaide’s’ airport as we boarded the turboprop driven Lockheed Metro for the flight to Coober Pede – the famous opal mining town in the Australian desert, a couple of hundred kilometers south of Alice Springs. Twenty–five assorted travelers climbed the two or three steps into the hot little cabin of the commuter plane and took their places in one of the two rows of twelve single seats that ran on either side of the narrow aisle. The twenty–fifth seat was placed in the aisle against the rear bulkhead, making the last row into a threesome. In the first pair of seats behind the curtained off flight…</p>
