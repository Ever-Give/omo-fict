        <p class="card-text">What is the reason for mankind&#039;s obsession with control? Everyone has the message imprinted on their mind: control your life, control the lives of others, and control the world around you. Dangerous as it may be, it is a desire which we all share, it&#039;s in the DNA, it&#039;s instinct. For centuries man has controlled woman, and only recently has she fought back, but she didn&#039;t want equality, she wanted to have that control for herself. Nobody is exempt from this rule.That was how I justified what I was doing this afternoon. When a woman seems to be in trouble it should be natural to want to help her, now shouldn&#039;t it? Well I blew it today, and I really mean that. I just got home and I had to tell you guys about my…</p>

        <p class="card-text">I was sitting in my apartment one day when I didn’t have much to do, wondering about Susanne Daley. I had met her a while back, and was wondering how old she would be now. The reason why she had entered my mind was a friend’s description of an incident that took place shortly before Susie’s fifteenth birthday, involving a jammed bathroom door. The Daleys didn’t live too far away from the apartment, I realised, and so there was a good chance that at least one of my two roommates would have met her.
As if in answer to my thoughts, at that very moment in walked Steve. Steve Benjamin was a funny guy, so naturally everyone liked him. It was only since we bought a flat together that I realised he had any kind of a…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Robert, a friend of mine, related this story to me a few weeks ago over a drink, when he was already a little drunk, and I thought you might like to hear it, so I made sure to press him for the details. He had been looking for a job over summer, to get some cash ready for his second year at college, and the opportunity came in the form of the Daley family. The Daleys were from England and had been friends of Robert’s parents since they moved in about five years ago, and so Robert was very familiar with their daughter Susanne. Susanne was fourteen, almost fifteen, and was growing up to be a very attractive young woman. I was introduced to her myself at around the same time, and she was quite striking in that…</p>
