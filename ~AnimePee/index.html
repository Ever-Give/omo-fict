        <p class="card-text">It was late (past ten) one warm Saturday evening. My three friends and I had been out, strolling along the darkened streets of our quiet little town. Streetlights cast a pale yellow glow across the concrete that outshone the meager light of the moon. The song of the nocturnal city wildlife, you know annoying bugs and birds, was drowned out by our constant chatter and peals of laughter.
Oh, but maybe I should tell you a little about my friends and myself first; and since I&#039;m the one telling the story, it&#039;s only fair that I get first description. My name is Emily Armstrong and at the time of this story I was eighteen and a recent High school grad. I had long blonde hair that dropped to the middle of my back and…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Mia Stevens got out of her white Kia Reo, the only car she could afford when her college costs were considered, and knew that she was more than a little nervous. It was late evening on a cool September night; the sun&#039;s final blood red rays were streaming through the leaves of a nearby tree. She pulled her blue jean jacket closer around her body to fend off the wind and started up the sidewalk towards the pale green house. At the age of nineteen, Mia was a beautiful girl. She had very long, curly black hair that was pulled back into a ponytail. Her curves were perfect and well defined and her face held the very essence of beauty. She was wearing a white sweater and light, faded blue jeans, just as she had been…</p>

        <p class="card-text">MaryBeth Pickman did little to hide her annoyance when her mother told her that the family was going to the zoo for her little brother Joey&#039;s birthday. She was, after all, eighteen years old, an adult and far too old to be going to the zoo with a small child. But, her mother had used the famous &quot;as long as you&#039;re living under my roof, you&#039;re living under my rules, and I say you are coming,&quot; and MaryBeth was forced to go. She was more than a little upset, thinking it unfair for her mother to say that to her, but she had little choice and that Friday found herself riding next to an overly excited Joey who did little more than talk about how much he wanted to see a real live elephant.
