        <p class="card-text">VFA–251, the &quot;Annie Oakleys,&quot; was the first all–female attack squadron in the U.S. Navy. Flying the versatile F/A–18D Hornet, they could strike any target from tanks to ships to aircraft. The Squadron Leader was Andrea, a Navy Commander. Newly formed, they got their first assignment at sea, to a Nimitz–class carrier.
All but one of the ten squadron members flew out to the carrier on schedule. One of the aircraft had serious mechanical problems, and the pilot, Denise, had to stay behind while it was repaired, since there were no spare aircraft available. By the time it was finally fixed the carrier was halfway to its patrol station. Denise had to fly out to meet it, traveling several hours over the ocean. The…</p>

        <p class="card-text">( I sent this in to the Thomas&#039; Water Resources site for their story of the month contest but the page hasn&#039;t been updated in an age. It&#039;s revisiting the superhero theme but I figured I shouldn&#039;t let the story go to waste. )
I nearly burned out my levitation ring trying to get back to the Hall of Justice after the pitched battle with the Brigade of Terror, but days like this were always worth it. I was the only one in the building, so I had the run of the place. I also knew that not all my superpowered colleagues in the Justice Force would be heading straight here. Some had secret identities to cover for, and would be heading out to assure their normal friends that they were fine. I could wait to do that…</p>

        <p class="card-text">The school bell rang, and in the halls teenage hearts were light, souls were filled with joy and libidos were fueled by lustful thoughts. No, it wasn&#039;t the end of the day. There was one more class to go. And not every student was consumed by this passion. No, the good feelings were limited to the handful of students whose next class would be taught by the one, the only, Ms. Timberlake. Ms. Timberlake was the most popular teacher in school, probably the most popular person, more popular than the head cheerleader, prom queen and homecoming queen combined. No mere blonde debutante or yearbook princess could hold a candle to her. An American father and an Indian mother had combined to give her an exotic look,…</p>

        <p class="card-text">It was strange that such a horrid bargain could evolve into such a pleasant experience, but the days since Belle’s father had given her to the Beast in repayment for saving his life had become more and more enjoyable. Her captor/host, once you managed to get past the horns and fangs, possessed an alluring charm far beyond physical appearance. He could be rough or brutal, but a gentle soul seemed to hide behind the gruffness, and Belle had made significant progress in bringing it out. Someday, he might even be a beast in appearance only; with a new personality and spirit to match he might find a way to regain his outward humanity as well. Though he rarely showed his appreciation, she was nevertheless rewarded…</p>

It was nearly impossible to drive with one hand on the wheel and one foot slammed down on the gas, but Brooke had no choice. Her other limbs were occupied. Her other hand was buried between her thighs, pressing and squeezing tight the mound of her puss through the sweaty spandex of her bike shorts. Her shapely, free leg was wrapped around the working one, and her thighs ground together hard. Her pert boobs rose and fell in her baby T–shirt as she breathed heavily through her teeth, every so often emitting a tortured moan or sob through her luscious lips. She was so lucky she hadn’t yet been stopped for speeding, as she was tearing through the…</p>

        <p class="card-text">It was the hottest day of the year, so naturally it was the day the air conditioner picked to conk out. Vicki and her daughter Nicki had to resort to such time honored standbys as ice cream, standing in front of the open fridge, and walking around in their underwear to keep cool. They’d also taken to drinking large amounts of very cool soft drinks, cola for Nicki, homemade lemonade for her mother. Nicki tried to keep her fluid intake measured, knowing the consequences of overdoing it, but Vicki, a New Englander who hated Summer, always drank as much lemonade as she could manage on a hot day. Nicki watched her closely as she went through her usual daily routine, clearing up and washing the breakfast dishes,…</p>

Though she’d never convince anyone else of it, it was often difficult being the most powerful woman in the world. Certainly, being a superheroine had its moments. You got to stomp on the occasional arch–criminal, you never aged so you always looked stunning, you were adored by millions of fans, especially undersexed boys, and you could always stride around confident in the knowledge that you could do things that no one else in the world could do. But there were drawbacks, things you couldn’t let the public know about or they might tarnish your heroic image. Keeping a secret identity was always the worst, because leading a double life can sap anyone’s strength, but…</p>
