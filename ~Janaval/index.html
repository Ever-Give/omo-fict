        <p class="card-text">You may have read a couple of our experiences already. Basically I have always had a thing about girls wetting themselves. I cross dress myself and when young, would often pretend to have accidents when dressed as a girl. I became my own ideal woman. All this was hidden well out of everyday sight as I grew up.
Eventually I met one or two girls who I was able to be more open with and began to have fun both sharing their clothes and with pee games. As I was not outwardly very masculine, girls used to assume I was gay and would confide all sorts of things to me. Strangely this gave me a great advantage and I certainly exploited these situations.
I met Val when I was a student. She is stunningly attractive and…</p>

        <p class="card-text">My partner and I were invited to an Old Skool rave at a friend&#039;s house last weekend. She had not initially understood the invite fully. It was obvious to me but although Val&#039;s English is excellent, it is not her first language and there are subtle cultural differences, which had eluded her. I realised that it was going to be predominantly 90&#039;s music but it was also going to be fancy dress. We were expected to go in school uniform or at least something that would pass as that.
Val was quite surprised. She has never really got her head round this schoolgirl nightclub thing. She feels that there is something odd about young women dressing as provocative schoolgirls, especially as she says the English are so…</p>

We hope you enjoy our contributions, if not for the writing, then just for knowing that what we write is true. Hopefully others will find wetting with a partner is not an empty dream, but with the right encouragement, something intimate and enjoyable for genuinely sharing.
I have a very special relationship with my partner Val, which works very much for both of us. She modelled very successfully for a while, making very good money. She now works in the fashion industry and we have just started our own business. Although she is not turned on by wetting directly, she is happy to play my games and I hers. She will wet…</p>

Val was fashion modelling, and now helps run an agency. When she first came over here from Italy, she worked in an antiques shop in between assignments. I met her there when I was a student and we got on pretty well. As she was new in England I helped her out with quite a few things. After six months she even had to move in with me, as she had got herself involved with a really dodgy landlord and didn&#039;t feel safe.
We were just friends at this stage, but any bloke would have wanted more, and I was happy to work my way slowly into her affections. Then as luck would have it, two bombshells landed in quick succession.…</p>
