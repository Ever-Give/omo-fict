        <p class="card-text">This story contains Female Desperation, Humiliation, Female Wetting, Female Peeing, and Golden Showers. When I got home, no one was around, so I quietly went to my room, changed clothes and went straight to bed. There was so much to dream about: wet panties, soaked pussies, and overwhelming ladies! Two weeks passed and nothing had happened. The weather was rather rainy and I had chosen to ride my bike or hitch a ride whenever some neighbor&#039;s kid had the same hours as I did. But summer came back and so did my desire to pick up my clothes. Doubtless, Mom would ask for them now that the weather allowed wearing them again. And maybe there was something else that attracted me to that house with a birch tree in…</p>

        <p class="card-text">This story contains Female Desperation, Deliberate Wetting, Humiliation, Golden Showers, and Domination. My parents didn&#039;t think I should be given a car, so usually I preferred riding my bike to school. But since that memorable day, I chose to walk home more often, benefitting from the fact that I could get a lift in the morning by a neighbor working close to my school. I knew my parents didn&#039;t expect me home at a specific time &#039; after all I was old enough to care for myself &#039; and I kept wandering along quiet roads, immersed in memories of &quot;Lady Birch&quot;: In my dreams I had needed a name for her, so I christened her after the tree standing in her front yard.At the same time, Lady Birch had started to feel qualms…</p>

        <p class="card-text">Prologue As she was pulling into the parking site at the largest supermarket in town, she felt her bladder tingle. A part of her now wished she had used the toilet before embarking on the weekly grocery shopping.But how urgent would her need to pee become? This morning, she had had quite some milk in her cereal, drank two glasses of fresh garden fruit smoothie &#039; there were just so many fruit in her garden &#039; and later she had slowly sipped through the contents of two bottles of mineral water whilst going about the normal house work. Too late she realized now that this comprised quite a quantity of liquid which had been slowly filtering through her system since.The last speed bump &#039; the movement vibrated through…</p>

        <p class="card-text">As the three women were lying in the sun after their lunch, a girl came riding along on her bicycle. With her long, shiny hair, her slender and athletic but well–rounded figure, and her –as usual – fashionable style of dress she was the siren boys might die for. She was living in the next village and not especially fond of Marianne, although she knew the girl liked her. At present, she was disappointed to see the group of women here, where she had thought to take a quick pee break in the bunker. She knew about the vagabond living there and as she did not like vagabonds she wanted to annoy him by peeing into his treasured home. She was relieved to see the three women were almost asleep and as it seemed, naked.…</p>

Laura was sitting in the folding chair, filming Gillian as she was holding Marianne and felt her body quiver with lust and expectation, but also with the urgent need to pee. They had been hiking almost two hours now, and the nice pee break behind the picturesque chapel had been before they started. Laura felt the three litres of water she had drunk in the meantime filling her bladder to full capacity. She was on the verge of letting go; she wanted to pee right in the chair she sat in. Thinking about this she realized Marianne could look right up her crotch since she wasn&#039;t…</p>

        <p class="card-text">It took only a few minutes for Marianne to return. She was dressed in casually cut, but a size too small jeans and a pink, wide cut tank top showing the laces and upper parts of her not color matching white bra. Still, the d&#039;collet&#039; gave a good impression of her large breasts. Laura wondered how she was going to support her apparently heavy backpack for hours, the straps directly rubbing on her skin. The jeans were apparently old, since the zipper didn&#039;t close all the way, making the jeans bulge out a bit below the beltline.
&quot;Here I am!&quot; Marianne said, &quot;And I brought a few bottles of water and some food for a picnic.&quot;
&quot;Okay, then let&#039;s go – we have provisions, too.&quot; The women answered and together they set…</p>

        <p class="card-text">A while ago – actually quite a while – I met a girl on the Internet. Casually, we exchanged some thoughts and experiences concerning watersports. After a while, we were already deeply into the subject and had dropped in passing some information about the people we had met on our way. In one of my mails I had answered her question whether I knew people in Europe who were into watersports, too, in writing her that I had made very few such acquaintances. Actually, all I remembered was a summer I had passed in France working on a farm, a while ago. It was a small hamlet with just a farm, two houses and a small chapel in a picturesque landscape of small mountains and green valleys. Nice place to be on holidays,…</p>
